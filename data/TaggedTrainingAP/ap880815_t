<HEAD>First Lady: Trauma of Shooting Led to Astrologer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Monday she consulted an astrologer on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s travel schedule because she was `` obsessed with his safety'' after he was shot in March 1981. It was `` a terrible trauma'' when her husband was shot, `` and you're in shock much longer than you know you're in shock,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a CBS News interview. `` And you reach out anywhere for, for comfort.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was first reported to have consulted an astrologer on her husband's schedule in a book by former White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. The White House later confirmed it. Interviewed during CBS' coverage of the Republican National Convention, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told anchorman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> that some months after the attack on her husband she heard about a woman who had said she would have warned against his public appearance that day. `` And I said, ` Oh, gee, did she really?' And I was so obsessed with his safety, that anytime he went out of the house, I think my heart stopped,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` So all I would do would, would be to ask her, ` Is, is this a, would he be all right? Is it better for him to go to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Wednesday or Tuesday?'''

 Worshipers screamed and lifted their hands toward the sky as a ray of light burst through the clouds Monday evening during an outdoor Mass where thousands came expecting a miracle. Shortly after the 6 p.m. Mass began at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neumann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, throngs of pilgrims stood and applauded as many spectators pointed skyward, crying that they saw <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and calling it a miracle. `` I saw the sun pulsating a lot and saw <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> about 10 times,'' said <PERSON> Mamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fertitta </PERSON>. `` Then I saw <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> above and the doves below.'' A dozen priests standing on a rooftop altar and 600 Eucharist ministers turned their backs to the crowd to look at the sky and wave. After minutes of silence, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON> pastor Monsignor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> began to sing `` Amazing Grace.'' People in the audience whipped out cameras to photograph the clouds and light. `` I saw baby <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> for an instant in the sky,'' said <PERSON> Koreth </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargahese </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> estimated the crowd for the service at about 12,000 people. To some in the crowd the shape they saw in the sky was the miracle they had been hoping for. Their shouts alerted others. Some then reported seeing the same apparation and others did not. `` I'm positive other people saw things and they took photographs,'' said Father <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, a Benedictine monk from <LOCATION> Pecos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` I did n't see anything, but some of the other priests on the altar did,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, a deacon of the <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> parish. Monday was the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> feast of the ascension of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> into heaven. The crowds were drawn to the charismatic parish in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by national attention given to three parishioners' reports that they received messages from the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> this spring, including tidings of miracles on the feast day Earlier Monday, parish members and priests laid hands on the pilgrims and said prayers for the scores of handicapped people present. Hundreds of people in wheelchairs and walkers settled on the grassy hillside beneath a 60-foot-long altar built atop the church office. `` I heard that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s crown was spinning on the statue inside the church last night, so I believe anything can happen,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> as she stepped off a bus with 43 other Catholics from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Parish officials did not confirm the rumor about the crown. <PERSON> James </PERSON> said he did not know whether attendance would reach the 20,000 people he said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> told him would come. `` It does n't matter how many are here. Some beautiful spirtual things are going on.'' The reported messages at the church came after <PERSON> James </PERSON> and several parishioners returned from <LOCATION> Medugorje </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, where six youths claimed they began seeing apparitions of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> in 1981 and two say they still see them daily. One group skeptical of the reports said the trip and the beginning of the messages was too coincidental to be believable. `` While we are certainly open to any verifiable paranormal events, so far the only amazing thing that has happened here is the fact that thousands of people would flock here from all over, against common sense, on the unverified claims of one man,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, spokesman for West Texans to Promote Rational Thought, a group that investigates claims of paranormal behavior. The three parishioners say <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and God speak to them during Monday night recitations of the rosary. The trio write the `` messages'' in notebooks and read them aloud after the service. `` I feel her love, her joy, her sorrow and that's what I write down,'' said one of the three, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Constancion </PERSON>, a former hospital therapist who quit her job to devote more time to prayer and church work.

 More than 75 Israeli troops broke into <PERSON> Yakub </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitoon </PERSON>'s home one recent morning, stayed about a half hour and took two cars, two television sets, a stereo, a vacuum cleaner and an electric drill. <PERSON> Zeitoon </PERSON> was the target of a `` tax sweep,'' the latest method used by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military government in the occupied territories to crack down on Palestinians who refuse to pay taxes. The eight-month-old <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> rebellion has largely moved from daily violent protests to a determined battle of wits and wills, with Arabs striving for independence and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seeking to maintain its administrative hold on the territories. That struggle for control is epitomized in the tax war. For the moment, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> appear to be winning. Israeli roundups of cars and electronics have had limited success in convincing Palestinians to pay personal or sales taxes. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials acknowledge about a 50 percent drop in tax collection in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zeitoon </PERSON> himself still refuses to pay. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has filed a complaint with the army, arguing that some methods used to try to convince Palestinians to pay taxes, such as confiscating identity cards, are illegal. Army officials deny the charges of illegality and say the Palestinians will suffer in the long run for their protest. `` We are going to have to cut services'' to the occupied lands, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> this month. For their part, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> contend that in 20 years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation, they have never gotten back in services as much as they paid in cash to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` For 20 years we lived like chickens, laying eggs that the Israelis took,'' <PERSON> Zeitoon </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We're tired of being treated like animals. Now we want our pride.'' The Palestinians' contention is supported by Israeli researcher <PERSON> Meron </PERSON> <PERSON> Benvenisti </PERSON>, who publishes annual studies of the occupied territories funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and Rockefeller Foundations. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> collected $ 80 million in direct and indirect taxes from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> in 1987 and returned $ 30 million to the occupied lands and southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, keeping $ 50 million for Israeli coffers, <PERSON> Benvenisti </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The tax war has intensified since King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> began cutting ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which he lost to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> stopped salaries for 21,000 Palestinians and abandoned a five-year, $ 1.3 billion development plan, leaving an administrative void. But even as early as January, underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising called on Arabs to stop paying taxes to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and many complied. Palestinians who paid taxes often were identified by graffitti scrawled on neighborhood walls or on Arab radio broadcasts, and their shops or homes were sometimes set afire or vandalized. In <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, about 70 percent of the 2,000 to 2,500 merchants have stopped paying taxes, according to <LOCATION> Zeitoon </LOCATION>, even though many have lost more in confiscations by the Israelis than they would have had to pay in taxes. <PERSON> Zeitoon </PERSON> said he owes the Israeli military government about $ 20,000, but the goods confiscated from him were worth about $ 75,000. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawan </PERSON>, who owned a stone-cutting factory before the uprising began in December, said he stopped paying business-related taxes in January and owes the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military administration about $ 750. When he refused to pay, they confiscated his $ 7,500 car, he said. But <PERSON> Rawan </PERSON>, 36, has another problem. Since January he has lived on the run, sleeping in the homes of friends, because he says soldiers told his wife he would be arrested if they could catch him. `` When I know the Israelis have a holiday, I try to sneak home and see my wife and two children,'' <PERSON> Rawan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in the home of a relative. `` During the week, I try to meet them at different places.'' <PERSON> Rawan </PERSON>'s factory has been closed down. He now earns small sums as a handyman and receives money monthly from a relative in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rawan </PERSON> thinks the underground leaders called for a ban on tax payments before they thoroughly thought about how seriously this would hurt Palestinians. But he says he will nevertheless obey the directive. `` We will give up what they ask us,'' he said. `` I have sacrified, yes. But compared to some _ the dead, the imprisoned _ it is little. When I think of them, how can I pay my taxes?''

 In a cramped gondola dangling beneath an 11-story helium balloon, with clouds obstructing any view below, the disembodied voice of the radar operator seemed scarcely to be believed. `` You have crossed the coast of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' the voice told three American balloonists on that still-dark early morning 10 years ago. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> asked if the message was indeed that which had eluded others for 105 years. Silence. Then, crisply, `` Sir, my radar is never wrong.'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maxie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, whooped with joy. Sunburned and weary after five days aloft, the businessmen-adventurers had made the first trans-Atlantic crossing in a balloon. The three landed their black-and-silver Double Eagle II later that day, Aug. 17, 1978, in a wheat field west of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Today, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> is the only one of the three still alive. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was killed in 1983 at age 48 when his balloon crashed in a West German forest during a race. <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON>, then 53, died in 1985 when his twin-engine airplane crashed shortly after takeoff in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, now 40 and a commercial airline pilot in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, said he has no specific plans to celebrate Wednesday's anniversary. But he said his thoughts often drifted back to that summer 10 years ago. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> recalled that after the initial jubilation, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> went to sleep while he and <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON> looked down through the clearing clouds on the lights of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The silent 112-foot balloon 15,000 feet up caught sounds that drifted skyward. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON> could hear dogs barking and trains rumbling along tracks nearly 3 miles below. `` Tears came to my eyes,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. `` I put my arm around <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> _ he'd always been somewhat like a father to me. I had n't felt that close to another human being for as long as I can remember.'' The men began the flight six days earlier when the Double Eagle II lifted up from <LOCATION> Presque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and headed toward <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> more than 3,000 miles away. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> says the flight was not without problems, including a clash of personalities. `` <PERSON> Maxie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> later stated that he wished he could have flown the flight by himself,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know what <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>'s feelings were, but I wanted someone to share this with I did n't want to be <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said conflicts arose when <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON> both began making key decisions. `` Any aircraft can only have one captain, and we had two: <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maxie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>,'' he said. But <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said conflicts were overshadowed by the hardships of the flight in the 12-by-6-foot living space crowded with TV cameras and navigational equipment. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s hang glider dangled beneath the gondola and 5,500 pounds of sand and lead for ballast hung over the sides in bags. `` There were many times the flight was in question,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> recalled. `` But how close it came to failure at each moment was interpreted different by each of us.'' They lost altitude rapidly at one point when ice chunks crusted the top of the balloon. They jettisoned valuable ballast. When they dropped to 4,000 feet the ice melted. Later in the flight they dumped more ballast, including an expensive navigation system that had failed on the second day. They tossed oxygen bottles, anything they could. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said that at one point, a bit delirious from the altitude, he chucked a $ 4,000 radio _ and only later noticed a jar of peanut butter that weighed as much. Plans were for <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> to fly the glider down once they made it to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. But 400 miles from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, it came down to a choice of dropping the glider, their last oxygen and food, or a propane tank for a heater to battle <PERSON> Abruzzo </PERSON>'s frostbite. The glider went. Radios also failed during the flight, and the men had to communicate by ham radio. `` The first guy I talked to would n't talk because I did n't have a license,'' said <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. `` And he did n't believe I was in a balloon over the middle of the ocean.'' Finally, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> reached an old man confined to a wheelchair in a home for the elderly somewhere in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` His call sign was ` G4JY.' I do n't think I'll ever forget that,'' he said. `` He talked to me until the last day of the flight. He was like the Good Shepherd.'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said the rough times were offset by the excitement. A high point, he said, came over <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> when a jumbo jet relayed a message from the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. The museum had asked to display the gondola and balloon in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum that houses the Apollo 11 moonship, <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON>'s Spirit of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> brothers' plane. In the final few hours the men believed they would make it to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON> had landed 51 years before after the first solo trans-Atlantic airplane flight. But over <LOCATION> Evreux </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, they realized they could not go on. The last of the ballast was gone, save for a bottle of champagne. They were 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, 3,107 miles and 137 hours from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> where the helium-packed balloon had taken off. The swiftly draining balloon envelope carcass and its gondola settled gently to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> as cheering spectators abandoned their cars along a nearby highway and rushed to the balloon. Hundreds tried to take a piece of history. `` It's hard to chew rubberized cloth,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. `` People were trying to tear little shreds off, but I think they were probably losing their teeth more than damaging the balloon.'' The French press dubbed them the `` new Lindberghs.'' But <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> says the only time he thought about <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON> was when the adventurers drew straws that evening to see which would sleep in <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON>'s bed at the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador's residence in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and his wife won. `` And I ended up on the floor after 30 minutes because I could n't sleep,'' he said. `` The bed was like a banana. The springs were shot.''

<TEXT>
 Israeli officials have stirred Arab protests with plans to dig an opening that will allow tourists to walk along the entire western wall of the ancient Jewish Temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70. Caretakers of the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosque complex, built on the 36-acre plateau that once held the temple, fear any digging will serve as a pretext to start excavations under the Islamic holy site. Palestinians in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> rioted in July, forcing <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> workers to halt digging an entrance in a narrow side street off the <LOCATION> Via </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dolorosa </LOCATION>, where tradition says <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> carried the cross to his crucifixion. Israeli officials say they will press ahead with the project once tensions subside. The controversy illustrates the deep suspicions and acute sensitivities that surround the site which is holy to the world's three major monotheistic religions `` Our desire to open the tunnel is purely cultural and touristic,'' <PERSON> Dany </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahat </PERSON>, chief archaeologist of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, told reporters during a recent tour. Part of the 350-yard tunnel, which follows the temple's western wall for most of its route, was the main commercial thoroughfare in the days of King <PERSON> Herod </PERSON>. Folded pieces of paper with the prayers of modern Jewish visitors who walked in the tunnel can been seen in the cracks between the huge, smooth stones which have remained in place since <PERSON> Herod </PERSON> rebuilt the temple in the first century B.C. It was first destroyed by <ORGANIZATION> Babylonians </ORGANIZATION> in 586 B.C. <PERSON> Herod </PERSON>'s second temple lasted until the <ORGANIZATION> Romans </ORGANIZATION> sacked it in 70. Testifying to the greatness of Islamic architecture are vaulted chambers built by the <ORGANIZATION> Mamelukes </ORGANIZATION> in the 13th century to support a bridge linking the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqsa </ORGANIZATION> complex with the city. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> was built in 536. The tunnel, excavated after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, can not be opened for tourists unless an exit is built, <PERSON> Bahat </PERSON> said. Moslem officials say they do not believe <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intentions are innocent, and underground leaflets call for <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to be on their guard to prevent attempts to excavate under the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> complex. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tahboub </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said Moslems feared the tunnel would be used to burrow under the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> complex. In 1981, Israeli militants dug a 25-yard shaft before Moslem guards stopped them. `` The purpose of the -LRB- tunnel opening -RRB- is political, to make the supporters of -LRB- Israeli -RRB- religious parties happy before the -LRB- Nov. 1 -RRB- elections,'' said <PERSON> Tahboub </PERSON>. `` Their ultimate target is to take all of the area.'' <PERSON> Gershon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>, head of a group of militant Jewish nationalists called the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faithful </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that the tunnel was the front line in a battle for control of the holy site. <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> said if Moslems were able to stop the tunnel they would try to expand their influence to other areas. The group met earlier in August with right-wing Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to press demands to open the tunnel immediately. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Achimier </PERSON> said the premier saw <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> `` primarily as a Jewish city'' and supported Jewish rights to the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>. But he said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s `` first priority for <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was calm and coexistence'' and nothing would be done to stir up the situation. <PERSON> Bahat </PERSON> said any further attempts to dig beneath the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> would be unlikely because two shafts leading from the tunnel under the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqsa </ORGANIZATION> complex are blocked by huge stones. <PERSON> Bahat </PERSON> defended earlier excavations, saying they helped improve health standards. He said the underground chambers had been used as sewers before 1967 and that seepage had leaked into the city's water supply But <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, chief engineer of the Moslem trust fund that administers <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON>, said Israeli excavation caused the ground to shift, resulting in serious damage to modern houses and to Islamic buildings of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. `` From the time digging started cracks began to appear in buildings over the tunnel,'' said <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>. `` This important <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> tunnel comes at the expense of our important Moslem buildings.'' To Jews, the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> is the holiest of all sites, the site of the temple that held the tablets on which <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> wrote the Ten Commandments. To Moslems, it is the <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, or Noble Enclosure in Arabic, where the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> ascended to heaven to receive the word of God from the Angel <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is the holiest Islamic site after the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>. To Christians, the temple was the site where <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> threw out the money changers. Christian Crusaders based themselves at the temple as well, converting <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> into a church for the Knights Templar.

 After years of being scorned as ineffective and anti-American, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is making a comeback as a potent instrument of international peacemaking, an old idea whose time has come again. Blue-helmeted <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops are peering through binoculars from the beaches of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to the mountains of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. About 350 soon will monitor a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, and they are likely to be deployed in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> under emerging peace pacts. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> owes its revitalized role to the superpowers' improved relations and their interest in redirecting resources from regional conflict to economic development If the organization is on a roll, it is because the superpowers have decided the time has come to exploit it. Recent mediation between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, leading to a planned cease-fire Aug. 20 in their 8-year-old war, has been the major accomplishment of Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. It followed a U.N.-brokered settlement in April between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after nearly nine years. The Afghan settlement was the culmination of years of patient diplomacy. When the Soviet leadership decided to cut its losses and withdraw, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> was there. A force of 50 unarmed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers is monitoring the withdrawal, which is to be completed by Feb. 15. `` As rarely before, we can see the organization's potential for peace, its utility as a trusted good officer,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said last week. `` Its peacemaking and peacekeeping can yet bring hope to those afflicted by endless violence.'' The momentum is building. A major <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> role is forseen in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops are separating Greek and Turkish communities on the divided island, and in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> to end the Vietnamese occupation. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops are also expected to monitor a troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, occupied by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in defiance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions, and a transition to independence in the territory. For years, massive <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> work in refugee aid, family planning, economic and agricultural development, childhood innoculation, teacher training and other areas was overlooked as the world focused on the organization's inability to end conflicts. Suddenly, years of diplomacy seem to be bearing fruit. For all the fanfare, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is desperately short on funds. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the first of the superpowers to rediscover the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> as a tool of foreign policy, is now paying its back dues and peacekeeping arrears. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> now hails the organization as a forum for `` new political thinking.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, by contrast, is the biggest <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> debtor. It has been withholding about $ 467 million in regular budget payments over several years and about $ 70 million in peacekeeping dues. For years, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> denounced the organization as an intrusion upon its sovereign right to act unilaterally and said it did n't like leftist <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> politics. It charged the body with squandering funds on Third World causes and refused to pay until reforms were promised. Now, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> praises <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accomplishments in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. But the money is not forthcoming. `` Now we face a new irony,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said. `` At the very time when the pursuit of peace quickens its pace throughout the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, bankruptcy threatens to close the organization.'' If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other debtor nations do not come up with funds soon, the organization could close this fall. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, successor to the League of Nations, was created in 1945 as an organization of peace-loving states repelled by World War II. Its aim was to maintain peace and security and work for social progress. One of the organization's most enduring problems in the last 40 years has been the search for a resolution of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. Each time the region has been threatened by war, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has sent impartial observers or peacekeeping forces. It has launched five peace-keeping operations since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was created in 1948, during which time six wars have broken out. The first <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer operation in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> was the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization. Created in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war to supervise a truce, <ORGANIZATION> UNTSO </ORGANIZATION> has remained to monitor armistice agreements between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its neighbors. Another <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> success in the region was the creation in 1956 of its first peacekeeping force, the U.N. <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, when Israeli, British and French forces moved into <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The force was essential in bringing about a cease-fire and the withdrawal of invading forces. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops sent to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in 1964 maintained peace before and after the Turkish invasion of 1974. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> operation in the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> from 1960 to 1964 helped restore peace but it was criticized for partisanship during a provincial secession and the intervention of Belgian troops.

 Asking about a sexual partner's health or sexual history is not a reliable means of avoiding AIDS because many people lie to have sex, a researcher says. One-third of sexually experienced male college students and 10 percent of women admitted in a study that they have told a lie of some sort to get someone to sleep with them, the researcher said. `` Asking partners about risk factors is probably not a very good strategy for reducing the risk of AIDS,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, associate professor in the psychology department of <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Northridge </LOCATION>. She described results of her survey Saturday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said she began the study after noticing that many women were asking sex partners about past behavor that carries a risk of AIDS infection as a way to reassure themselves about having sex with the man. People can get infected with the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome by having sex with an infected person or using an infected needle or contaminated blood products. Questioning partners about their drug use and sexual history is not an effective substitute for taking precautions such as using condoms, she said. The study focused on 422 unmarried, sexually experienced college students at two <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> campuses. Ages ranged from 18 to 25 with an average of 19. Forty-six percent were men. Thirty-five percent of men admitted to telling a lie to have sex. In addition, 47 percent of men and 60 percent of women reported that somebody had lied to them in order to have sex. The study did not specify what the respondents had lied about. Other questions asked what the person would do if honesty threatened the chance to have sex or to maintain a desired dating relationship. Asked if they would falsely claim to have taken a blood test to detect exposure to the AIDS virus, and claim the result was negative, 20 percent of men and 4 percent of women said yes. Forty-seven percent of men and 42 percent of women said they would report having had fewer sexual partners than they really did. Still, 52 percent of the women said they ask sex partners about sexual and drug histories, and 23 percent ask if partners had taken an AIDS test. `` If you ask somebody if they have risk factors and they say yes, you can be reasonably assured they're not lying,'' <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said. `` But if they say no, you're not really any further along than not asking.'' <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kinsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in Sex, Gender and Reproduction, said the results make sense. `` In the dating situation, you ca n't believe and act upon information that comes from the partner,'' she said. `` You have to take care of yourself.''

 Actor <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barty </PERSON> was delighted as he settled his 3-foot-9 frame into the blue and white chair. His feet touched the ground. `` How can you put a price on the smile that came across his face?'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Buzzella </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Sunburst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outdoor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION>, which is beginning production on one of the first specially designed lines for dwarfs, midgets and other adults of small stature. `` To be able to sit in a chair with your feet touching the ground is something average-size people do n't even think about,'' <PERSON> Buzzella </PERSON> said. `` For little people, it's an uncommon thrill.'' <PERSON> Barty </PERSON>, a consultant on the project, said the Sunburst outdoor furniture designs are among the first of any kind of furniture produced specifically for `` little people,'' as he terms anyone afflicted by the nearly 200 different forms of dwarfism. `` We are a minority that is really a minority,'' said the 63-year-old actor in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, where he is filming a movie. `` We are mostly handicapped by physical barriers we face. Clothes have to be cut down; light switches are too high.'' `` I ca n't tell you how wonderful it felt like to sit in a chair with your feet on the ground and your back in the proper place,'' added <PERSON> Barty </PERSON>, who has championed the little people's cause since the late 1950s. Sunburst, which supplies outdoor furniture to resorts and hotels around the world, began thinking small last year with a line of children's furniture for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>. Company founder and president <PERSON> R.W </PERSON>. <PERSON> Buzzella </PERSON>, who had built a scaled-down bar and stool set for a dwarf couple three years ago, thought the children's furniture might be adapted for the nation's 1.5 million little people A letter was sent in March to <PERSON> Barty </PERSON> at his Foundation For Little People office in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barty </PERSON> quickly responded and arranged a visit to the Sunburst production center in <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION> shortly after the release of `` Willow,'' in which he plays a high priest `` But he immediately showed us that furniture for little people and children are very different,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Buzzella </PERSON>, arranging three chairs side by side. The children's chair was smaller but in the same proportions as the adult version. The little people's model was modified with a low seat and elevated armrests to accommodate their shorter limbs and torsos. `` It was a real learning experience for us,'' <PERSON> Buzzella </PERSON> said. `` You just ca n't put a little person in children's furniture. It does n't work and they are not comfortable. They have their own special dimensions.'' Sunburst, a division of <ORGANIZATION> MetalTech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, unveiled the Rainbow Collection in July at a convention in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, attended by about 600 little people. <PERSON> Buzzella </PERSON> took about 80 furniture orders. Many had special requests, such as an extra narrow seat for a woman with a rare, acute form of dwarfism. The profit for Sunburst in the venture is also small, he said. `` To be candid, a big manufacturer would not touch this project,'' <PERSON> Buzzella </PERSON> said. `` It's not smart business. It's not a big-volume-type deal. But this company has been fortunate, and we'd like to give something back and not just think about the dollars involved. Sunburst, which had sales of about $ 5 million last year, scored a success in 1964 with the patent of an aluminum umbrella designed to withstand harsh weather and high winds. The umbrellas are used in most fast-food franchises and many hotels worldwide, <PERSON> Buzzella </PERSON> said. `` I know they're never going to make money on making furniture for little people,'' <PERSON> Barty </PERSON> said. `` That's what makes it so special. They have gone beyond money and done something for people who have become accustomed to being ignored.''

 Leaked campaign strategy memos laced with coarse remarks threaten to ignite racial tensions in the early stages of a mayoral campaign that pits a Jewish city councilman against black incumbent <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. The memos were prepared by a consulting firm associated with 39-year-old City Councilman <PERSON> Zev </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaroslavsky </PERSON>, who is seeking to become the city's first Jewish mayor and poses by many accounts the first real challenge to <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> in a decade. Both are Democrats; the race is nonpartisan. The documents by veteran strategists <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Agostino </PERSON>, whose firm is known as BAD Campaigns, berate <PERSON> Yaroslavsky </PERSON> about his grim demeanor, mock <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s intelligence, refer to environmentalists as `` tree huggers'' and slow-growth advocates as `` crazed homeowners.'' The strategists urge <PERSON> Yaroslavsky </PERSON>, who represents a chunk of the city's largely affluent and liberal west side, to skip <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meetings and focus his energies on fund-raising efforts among Jewish contributors. `` What we do know is that Jewish wealth in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is endless,'' said one of the memos, which were leaked anonymously. Elsewhere, the advisers wrote: `` The reason why BAD thinks you can beat <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> is: You've got 50 IQ points on him -LRB- and that's no compliment -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> and <PERSON> D'Agostino </PERSON>, after the memos' release last week, announced their `` regrets that our private, irreverent attempts at humor might have caused embarrassment or offense.'' <PERSON> Yaroslavsky </PERSON> quickly divorced himself from the consultants, saying, `` I do not agree with many of their ideas and I find many of their statements to be insulting, insensitive and not reflective of my views.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley-Thomas </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the memos' contents `` come perilously close to being blatant racist remarks. `` At the absolute minimum they're highly insensitive,'' he said. He said the memos threaten to inflame black resentment over a perceived lack of Jewish support during <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s failed 1986 campaign for governor, and over tensions that emerged between Jews and blacks during <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s Democratic presidential bid earlier this year. The mayor, who at age 70 is seeking an unprecedented fifth term as mayor of the nation's second-largest city, denounced the memos as unprincipled and potentially racially divisive. `` Talking about the relative intelligence of candidates is of no consequence,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. `` I think I've demonstrated over the years my intelligence and my ability to handle the public's problems. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has become politically vulnerable because of his protracted tenure of 16 years and position on environmental issues. He has switched from opposition to approval of a proposed onshore drilling project near <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION>, an exclusive canyon enclave overlooking the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Despite its name, BAD Campaigns is a highly regarded firm. `` <PERSON> D'Agostino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> are extremely well-respected as very capable and talented and winning consultants,'' said former Republican <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bobbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> found his advice amusing when <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> submitted similar pointed comments during <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s unsuccessful 1969 mayoral campaign and in 1973, when he was elected the first black mayor of a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city. `` When it's excerpted, it becomes a bit embarrassing,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said of the memos. `` We do n't mean to offend anybody. We had no intention of offending the mayor on the IQ.'' <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, summing up the controversy, said, `` I think what's happened is that the voters have been given a glimpse into what politics is really like. Political consultants in general `` tend to see themselves as the movers and shakers and the candidate as the vehicle,'' she said. `` So they often will seem somewhat arrogant and paternal to this woeful candidate.''

 In his northern <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> stronghold, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remains a pervasive, respected figure more than two years after a Manila-based uprising toppled his 20-year authoritarian regime. `` I tell you that if he ran again, he would win hands down here,'' said <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benemerito </PERSON>, mayor of the town of <LOCATION> Pagudpud </LOCATION> in the province of <LOCATION> Ilocos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was born in 1917. `` You know, we Ilocanos are very clannish.'' In most of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> years are associated with massive corruption, economic mismanagement and oppression. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he fled after the February 1986 uprising that propelled her to power. But in his native province, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> still enjoys widespread respect among his fellow Ilocanos. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> rewarded the province, which has a population of about 440,000, with roads and development projects. Ilocanos are strongly represented within the armed forces, although precise figures are not available. Rep. <PERSON> Roque </PERSON> <PERSON> Ablan </PERSON>, a pro-Marcos congressman, says allegations of massive corruption and embezzlement of up to $ 10 billion have not significantly dented support for the ousted leader. `` In spite of all the accusations and charges, we still look up to Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ablan </PERSON> said. `` We would like to see him come home, which is the right of every Filipino.'' The spirit of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> looms over this province, about 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Rural bus stops and walls of buildings in <LOCATION> Laoag </LOCATION>, the provincial capital, still bear graffiti such as `` No To Cory'' or `` Marcos Once More,'' his slogan in the fraud-tainted 1986 election. Most provincial and municipal officials elected in regional balloting in January are members of or have been aligned with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, which has virtually disintegrated elsewhere in the country. In the town hall of <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family ancestral home, pictures of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, hang on the walls of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> office. There is no picture of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` People here still respect Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Abaya </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest in <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION>. `` They would like to see him come home, although not necessarily as president. They respect him for his intelligence.'' Pro-Marcos politicians insist they are no longer anxious for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return as president but as a private citizen. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> claimed he won the 1986 election against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and left <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> only after having himself sworn into office. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> loyalists were linked to at least three major attempts to topple the Aquino government. `` In all our conversations with Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, he always told us to cooperate with the Aquino government and join hands to fight the communists,'' <PERSON> Ablan </PERSON> said. But not every Ilocano is a dedicated <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> loyalist. Communist rebels have made strong inroads in <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> since 1981, and by military estimates there may be as many as 500 Ilocanos in the communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Pro-Marcos sympathies were whipped up three months ago when supporters of the former president spread reports he would come home for the funeral of his mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON>, who died May 4. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> refused to allow him to return, and the mother is still unburied. Still, rumors persist that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> will return soon. The province's association with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has not been a handicap under the new administration. Provincial Gov. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Farinas </PERSON> said the Aquino government has not discriminated against <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> in the allocation of state funds. But the <ORGANIZATION> Laoag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, which once received charter flights from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, has been closed to foreign traffic since September 1986 to prevent <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from slipping into the counry. Airport manager <PERSON> Numeriano </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramones </PERSON> said only three flights a week come in from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Security guards doze on the tables next to X-ray machines, and goats, cattle and stray dogs wander over the tarmac. Residents of a nearby village have erected a makeshift basketball court at the southeastern end of the tarmac. The closing of the <LOCATION> Laoag </LOCATION> airport to international traffic has severely curtailed business at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ilocandia </LOCATION>, a 196-room resort built to host the wedding reception of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' daughter <PERSON> Irene </PERSON>. It was hoped the resort and its casino would attract high rollers from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and Filipino immigrant families from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wishing to vacation in their homeland. Last week, the hotel had only three guests.

 The phone has been ringing off the hook with calls from ordinary citizens at the Embezzlement and <ORGANIZATION> Bribery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> ever since it opened in the east district of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The office is a sign of the times in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, as the government tries to control corruption all over the country. `` The response of the people has been excellent,'' said a frazzled <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuhua </PERSON>, the 35-year-old station head, a week after the center opened July 29. `` They are very curious and have many complaints.'' Housed in a cramped 19th century mud-and-mortar dwelling, capped with the traditional sweeping eaves of a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> home, the center is in a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> alley, next to a butcher shop. `` We wanted the people to be at home,'' <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said. `` If we stuck it on the fifth floor of a government building, no one would come see us.'' The station is manned six days a week for eight hours a day and is equipped with a telephone answering service for after-hours calls. In all, the station is responsible for about 6,000 government employees serving 1.5 million people. All reports are taken in secret to protect the callers and all investigations are handled by the reporting station. `` Too much corruption is investigated in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by the corrupt bureau itself,'' said <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Songching </PERSON>, the 50-year-old director of the east district's investigative wing. `` But this reporting station will do its own work. We are eager to see results.'' Similar corruption reporting centers are opening all over the country and the government says that by September every province will one. In addition, a telephone corruption hotline opened in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in early August, ready to take calls from across the nation. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said such devices are necessary if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is going to reform its government. `` In the past the government always policed itself,'' he explained. `` Now we've got to have the support of the masses. We ca n't clean up the government alone.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has always tolerated a certain level of official dishonesty. `` Guanxi,'' or connections, are the grease upon which the wheels of society run. But lately corruption has been getting out of hand. `` I am shocked at the change in my country,'' said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Poming </PERSON>, who returned in July after eight years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Corruption is everywhere. School teachers force their students to buy breakfast from them to make more money. Students steal tests and sell them for a profit.'' `` Corruption and inflation, that's all we Chinese are talking about,'' said <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuanshang </PERSON>, a bookstore owner in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` We are worried that all the dirt will stop the reforms.'' The reforms, pushed for the last decade by national leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, have helped to double <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s gross national product in five years to $ 295 billion in 1987. But, by creating a two-track pricing system of low state-set prices and higher free market prices, the reforms have created vast opportunities for illegal deals. In late July, 75 state-run businesses in the industrial city of <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> were exposed for making illegal profits off peasants. The firms bought state goods at fixed low prices and sold them to farmers at large profits. The reselling scheme has become so bad in the cigarette and liquor market that on July 28 the government raised the price of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s best brands by as much as 790 percent. The official press said the move was made to crush a black market that has gained a monopoly on high-quality cigarettes and spirit sales. In battling corruption, the government's policies have been unclear _ lax in one city, harsh in the next and creative somewhere else. In <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION>, a northern city, the city government recently imposed a tax on banquets, cars and firecrackers, three items that officials often use public funds to buy. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yonghang </PERSON>, 35, who had been working for several years at the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was executed July 25 for taking bribes in exchange for color television sets, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. In all, he received bribes worth 120,000 yuan -LRB- $ 32,400 -RRB-, which amounts to 125 years of the average urban salary. Still, because of `` guanxi,'' a great percentage of official corruption continues. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading paper, the People's Daily -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Renmin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ribao </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, recently told of <PERSON> Gu </PERSON> <PERSON> Chengju </PERSON>, a forestry official in <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION> province who stole 300,000 yuan -LRB- $ 81,000 -RRB- in state funds to build an office building and a high-class guest house. Almost two years after his case was exposed, <PERSON> Gu </PERSON> has yet to be brought to justice. The reason is that <PERSON> Gu </PERSON> has been greasing the hands of local officials who were supposed to investigate him, the paper said. `` This feudalistic practice of officials shielding one another must end,'' it said in a strong editorial. Some Western analysts, notably <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> expert with the <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, view the growing corruption as a sign that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is becoming more democratic. `` During the Cultural Revolution the dirt and sleaze was just as widespread but it was being perpetrated by only a few individuals,'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. `` Now, at least, you have a situation where more people are being allowed to participate. That is not necessarily bad.'' <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuhuan </PERSON> and his colleagues at the Embezzlement and Bribery Reporting Station in east <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> do not agree. `` When a rat crosses the street the people run to beat it,'' <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said, citing a popular proverb. `` To me, corruption is the rat and I must kill it.''

 Republicans paid $ 100 a piece for Sunday night snacks with a zoo elephant as their rollicking pre-convention weekend wound down. The Very Important Pachyderm at the `` Elephant Romp Welcome'' at <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> was <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON>, who drew adoring attention from the herd of 3,600 partiers. `` It's a wonderful elephant, obviously Republican,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milke </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delegate and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> city councilwoman. <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON>'s handler, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Holston </PERSON>, said the 1,200-pound elephant was named the convention's official mascot, and had a full schedule of national television appearances for the entire week. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> city councilman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON>, who took credit for the zoo party idea, said the goal was to stuff a 3-week <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> experience into three hours. `` A philosophy of this party, I think, would be that in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, we believe that throwing a party, hosting a party, really is an art. It really is a science,'' said Early, a Democrat. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> chef <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Prudhomme </PERSON> stirred chicken etoufee under one of four air-conditioned zoo tents, and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s, which claims to dispense more alcohol than any bar in the world, prepared 2,000 potent Hurricanes in 15-ounce paper cups. `` This is the official drink, and we want the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to try it,'' said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> Sunday was filled with dancing and Dixieland from the French Quarter to private homes in the fashionable Garden District. Jazz musicians had plenty of work. At the <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, a three-piece group entertained incoming guests, while another combo imparted Dixieland flavor to a congressional brunch. Across the street at the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> sponsored a $ 20,000-plus feast featuring 1,000 pounds of seafood flown in for the occasion, and exotic treats like moose and reindeer sausage. Seafood flown into a city known for its seafood? `` That's your kind of seafood, not necessarily our kind,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> GOP chairman. `` But I do n't think there's a better party town in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Some delegates got a head start on the festivities Saturday night with a rollicking river boat race, <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> Gras-style parade and samplings of turtle soup au sherry. At the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' Convention Center, delegates tasted the city's finest cooking and danced behind a fast-marching city high school band and miniature <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> floats. The floats carried costumed party-goers who pitched plastic beads and doubloons touting the carnival's sponsor, The <ORGANIZATION> Times-Picayune </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, an alternate delegate from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> who has attended three conventions, scoffed at decorum and danced in the parade. `` This is the greatest party ever,'' said <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, swaying in a navy blazer and purple beads. White-uniformed servers from Commander's Palace ladled 138 gallons of turtle soup au sherry into white styrofoam bowls. At the 105-year-old restaurant, an appetizer portion runs $ 4.50. On a night of freebies, there were very few leftovers. `` The food's a big hit, and so's the parade,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>'s supervisor. `` One nice thing about <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. It opens you up and brings you back to a childhood state. Folks start out saying about the dancing that it's really stupid. But five minutes later, they are out there chasing the band.'' Jefferson Parish Sheriff <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a Democrat, watched the Republicans eat, drink and dance, then said with laughter, `` We'll party with them now, and then we'll slug it out this November.

<HEAD>Reagan Makes Unprecedented Effort For Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In a unique, farewell political role, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is taking the offensive as he campaigns for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican ticket. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is center stage tonight for the address that will be the true keynote of the Republican National Convention. It also will be his grand finale, at his fourth convention as a dominant <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> figure. But it's only the start of his planned campaign. No modern president has conducted a parting campaign to match the one <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has promised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Republicans. He expects to appear at least twice a week in behalf of the ticket and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising efforts from Labor Day to Election Day. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tone so far has been tough, sometimes contrasting with the reassuring style that became typical of his personal campaigning over the past dozen years. Not since <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> has a departing president been in a position to campaign for his party's nominee to succeed to the office. <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> served two full terms, and left office as a popular figure. But Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, the Republican nominee in 1960, did not seek extensive campaigning from <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. Popularity is not transferable, of course. And there can be a down side for a vice president who relies heavily on the campaign favors of the president to whom he has been understudy. The vice president has to make his own imprint on the minds of voters, and he has a relatively brief time to do it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his managers believe they can make the breakthrough beginning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, aided, not inhibited, by an active <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaign. `` He'll be a great surrogate,'' said campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be especially helpful to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ticket in <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION> states and in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Furthermore, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may be able to help turn on and turn out conservatives, who never have counted the vice president as one of their heroes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have carefully designed roles in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, so that the departing president wo n't overshadow the arriving nominee. The twain will meet once, on Tuesday, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrives for the convention and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for a vacation at his ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. From that point, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is supposed to have the starring role The tandem campaign began in the buildup to the convention, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to the administration's political appointees, the president telling them that the voters wo n't gamble the future on `` a blind date'' with the Democrats. In his weekly radio address on Saturday, the president said the Democrats are all talk, while `` we deliver.'' Then, in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> arrival preview of his convention address, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hammered the Democrats, with periodic plugs for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He denounced the `` narrow agenda of the liberal elites and special interest groups,'' said the Democrats do n't want the voters to find out what they intend to do and called their <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention the biggest masquerade since <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>. In all of that, he pressed a theme designed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, the argument that Democrats are hiding from specifics and from comparison of their offerings with those of the Republicans. `` The stealth candidacy has to come out from under cover,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` It's time to talk issues, to use the dreaded ` L' word, to say the policies of our opposition are liberal, liberal, liberal.'' That ` L' word is going to echo through the Superdome convention hall all week long. It is part of an attack strategy campaign the Republicans intend to make central to their campaign.

 More than 1,200 Salvadoran refugees returned from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to their homeland Sunday after being delayed at the border in a dispute over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church people accompanying them, a radio report said. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees said by telephone that the refugees and more than 150 vehicles were allowed to enter <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> at 5:30 p.m. -LRB- 7:30 p.m. EDT -RRB- after the 15 church workers agreed to stay in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Salvadoran government officials say many refugees sympathize with leftist guerrillas, and have accused church workers of similar leanings. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said the refugees were on their way to hometowns in northern <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> province. There was no immediate comment from the Salvadoran government. Members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church organization that had aided the refugees could not be reached for comment. Late Saturday, the convoy of 36 buses and 116 trucks carrying the refugees and their belongings were halted in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> about 500 yards from the border. They had left the <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> refugee camp 30 miles to the north under an accord worked out among the refugees, the Salvadoran government and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organization, which is overseeing the repatriation. Some of the Salvadorans spent up to eight years in the <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> camp. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendiluce </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency's Central American director, said the presence of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church workers _ members of the <ORGANIZATION> Going </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> organization _ was not contemplated in the accord. Earlier Sunday, Interior Minister <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Belloso </PERSON> <PERSON> Funes </PERSON> told reporters at the border that his government `` welcomes with open arms'' the Salvadoran refugees. `` But the so-called internationalists among them are using our brothers for strictly political ends. They -LRB- the foreigners -RRB- are coming here to break our laws, and I have orders from the highest level that they not be permitted entry,'' he said. <PERSON> Amadeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a returning refugee, had said the group was insisting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church workers be allowed to enter. He said the refugees were determined to wait in their mile-long convoy until their demand was met. But the 1,230 refugees, including hundreds of infants and children, had little food and appeared unprepared to spend days waiting on the road. Two pregnant women among the refugees were expected to give birth in coming days. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitale </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and spokesman for the Going Home delegation, blamed the Salvadoran government for the dispute. `` This is part of the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> government's continuing efforts to obstruct the refugees' return,'' he said, adding that all members of his delegation had visas for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Going Home is an interfaith organization supporting Salvadoran refugees. It participated last October in the first big repatriation of Salvadoran refugees from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The return of refugees is a highly charged issue in this small Central American country torn by nearly nine years of civil war. The armed forces consider the three Salvadoran refugee camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> part of the rear guard of leftist guerrillas fighting the U.S.-supported government. About 4,300 refugees returned last year and about 15,000 Salvadoran refugees remain in the camps. The Salvadoran government is concerned about their political sympathies and the burden they may place on an economy devastated by war, and so it is reluctant to collaborate with that project. But a regional peace accord signed last August underscored the right of refugees to return home, and the government eventually cooperated with the return. `` The terrorists use <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> as a refuge, to recover from wounds and to rest. The people there generally sympathize with the subversives. Their return could be detrimental to us militarily,'' army Col. <PERSON> Ciro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Roque </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at the border Saturday. He is commander of the 4th Brigade in charge of the northern frontier province of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>. But he also said that `` as a Salvadoran, I recognize that every Salvadoran has a right to be in his country, and should be here.'' The refugees intend to return to three towns in <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> from which they fled in the early 1980s. <PERSON> Sofia </PERSON> <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON>, who left her town of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranchos </LOCATION> in 1982, stood beside a bus and held her infant daughter while another daughter clutched her skirt. Both girls were born in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. Asked why she left, she said: `` We were persecuted. They were killing people just for the fun of it.'' Most of the 65,000 people killed in the war have been civilians. Human rights groups blame security forces and rightist death squads for most of the tens of thousands of political murders in the early 1980s. Such killings dropped off dramatically after 1983. Ms. <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON>, 25, said she hoped for a better life in her own country. But asked how she planned to manage as a single mother with two children, no home and no job, she said: `` Who knows.''

 The Republicans who are about to nominate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president see some 200 shortcomings in the candidate. They say he's too liberal or too conservative, too nice or too honest, too rich or too loyal. A few uttered the word `` wimp'' but others defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> against such a label. `` He's a lousy campaigner,'' carped <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> lawyer whose favorite candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, lost out to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the race for the nomination. `` He has n't been elected to a major office for quite a few years, and I'm a little worried about that, I guess,'' <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Warkenthien </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> said of the man who was elected vice president in 1980 and 1984. <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warkenthien </PERSON> were among 1,215 delegates to the Republican National Convention who responded to an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey. In all, 2,277 delegates will attend the convention which opens today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. When asked to identify <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s major strengths and weaknesses, delegates' responses fell into 228 categories on his weaknesses and 127 on his strengths. Sixty-three percent of the delegates said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s experience in government, especially his work in foreign policy, would be his greatest asset in the fall election. `` In all the years that I have been attending national conventions, there has not been a single aspirant who has the congressional, executive and leadership experience'' of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hering </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, who has been attending conventions since 1964. In addition to serving as vice president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been director of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s biggest problem, according to those who are about to nominate him for president, is his image and speaking style. Nearly 32 percent of the delegates cited these as the obstacles he needs to overcome in his race for the White House. Many said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been unfairly labeled as a `` wimp'' and blamed the news media for pinning that on him. `` He is perceived as being weak _ the wimp factor _ a <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> character,'' said <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillot </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. `` It is n't weakness, it's decency, integrity, but people see it as weakness and it could cost him the election.'' <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> was direct: `` They do n't put wimps in as head of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. The delegates see being vice president as both a blessing and a curse, allowing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be a part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's successes but also forcing him to take the heat for its failures while keeping his opinions to himself `` He's the vice president, which is a weak office. Someone said it ai n't worth a cup of warm spit and he has proven how true that is,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Clement </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` He will end up apologizing for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on civil rights issues, ethics issues, economic issues,'' <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> said. `` He's got a lot of baggage.'' While there was no shortage of criticism, almost all of the delegates also had nice things to say about their nominee. `` When he tells you something, you can believe him,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` His greatest strength is the fact that he's been part of an administration that has seen the country come from the brink of disaster to a very solid, stable situation in about every aspect,'' said <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think he would have been made head of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> if he was n't intelligent,'' said <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. And finally there was a piece of advice. `` If he can appear as the All-American Boy Scout, that'll be his strength,'' said <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was impeached and removed from office as the state's governor in April.

 At first glance, the Republicans appear to have gathered in hostile political territory, but an overwhelming Democratic registration edge masks growing Republican strength in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. New Orleans Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON> and a vice chairman of the national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, leads a city where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 189,741 to 34,853. Statewide, there are 2,146,867 registered voters and only about 322,000 of them _ 15 percent _ are Republicans. In the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, there are 23 Republicans among the 144 members. Republicans have been scarce in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> since Reconstruction. Populist Democrats like <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, who taxed oil companies to provide free state services, further cemented the Democrats' hold on the state. When blacks became a voting force as a result of the civil rights movement, Democrats broadened their base, despite occasional defections by white voters to states' rights candidates. But things are looking up for the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> GOP. Republicans have won five of the last eight presidential races in the state. Half of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House members are Republicans now. Ten years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> registration was just 79,900 and the long-standing joke was that they could hold the state convention in a telephone booth. Chinks in the Democrats' <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> fortress first were seen more than 30 years ago, when the state went for <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> in the 1956 presidential race. In later years, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s electoral votes went to Republicans <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> in 1964, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1972 and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984. In 1972, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, after three losing campaigns, became the first Republican to win a congressional seat in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> since Reconstruction. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> later became the first Republican governor since Reconstruction when he was elected to the post in 1979. Ironically, he was helped by a law the Democrats had pushed to help themselves _ the unique `` open primary'' law. All candidates from all parties run in one election. If no candidate wins a majority, the top two finishers, regardless of party, face a runoff. The law was designed to keep Democrats from exhausting their energies and campaign funds in volatile primary battles against each other only to face a single, well-financed Republican in a general election. But, since anyone could vote _ regardless of party registration _ it allowed conservative Democrats to cross party lines and vote for Republicans. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gains, former Republican Rep. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> forced Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> to wage a tough, come-from-behind battle in 1986 to keep Democratic control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat left vacant by the retirement of <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a powerful Democrat and son of <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>. All is not roses for the Republicans in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, even with the open primary. For example, Democrats remain so strong that the planners for the 1988 GOP convention yanked Democratic Mayor <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> off the schedule for their nationally televised opening night ceremonies so his welcoming remarks would be made during a less conspicuous morning session. After his 1986 loss to <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he did not think a Republican could beat a Democrat in a head-to-head match. That was three years after <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> was overwhelmingly defeated when popular two-term governor <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a Democrat, returned to politics after a four-year hiatus. And, although <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' political fortunes fell with the price of oil and the state's poor economy, it took another Democrat, <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, to drive <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> out of office in last year's election. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> came from the back of a five-man pack to beat <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, the Republican who had been considered a sure bet for a runoff with <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> believes the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> GOP's growing strength results in part from the tenacity of Republicans like him who ran against enormous odds in the 1950s and 1960s. `` If I had the wisdom of my present age, which is 60, when I ran for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, I probably would not have run for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> back in 1962,'' he said. But he does not regret it. `` That race led to the'64 race and the'68 race ... and eventually to the race I won in 1972.''

 New Hampshire Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> is leading a Republican National Convention assault on his neighbor, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee has displayed `` an absolute incapacity to manage.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, a frequent critic of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, conducted a spirited denunciation of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> record on the eve of the GOP convention. And <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who will speak to the convention Tuesday night, added: `` I'm saving the good stuff.'' `` It takes an absolute incapacity to manage to have reached the fiscal chaos that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has today,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said at a news conference Sunday following a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governors and former governors. He was joined by a half-dozen other governors as he attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' management of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> budget in the face of a severe deficit this year. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> failed to take steps that other governors did to head off a deficit when they saw indications of an economic slowdown. To deal with the resulting shortage, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> resorted to borrowing from the retirement fund for state employee pensions, as well as tax increases, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. `` The fact is that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had no handle on his budget. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had no capacity to deal with a tough situation that he created on his own,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had no management understanding, in a timely way, of what should have been done, and what <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has done since then in order to deal with next year's deficit is absolutely irresponsible.'' He used the word `` steal'' to describe the state's borrowing from its pension system and said the action `` ought to strike fear in the hearts of anyone who draws a Social Security check.'' At a brunch earlier, former Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> delivered a plea for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> not to forget that states need to take action to deal with problems, even while the Republicans `` put a harness on the government in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' `` Somebody's got to fix the schools and save the outdoors and fix the roads and clean the streets,'' he said. `` And you do n't get to be a governing conservative majority by voting ` no' in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> alone. Most of the work that's done on schools and jobs and the outdoors is done by governors.'' Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governors, urged a close examination of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record during his three terms as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, saying the state had merely benefited from an economic boom throughout <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` There is some concern that the ` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Miracle,' which has been presented by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, may not be quite a miracle,'' <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> said, referring to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign slogan for the state's economic health. `` ... Perhaps it's a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> mirage.'' At <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign headquarters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Akey </PERSON> did not immediately return a reporter's call seeking comment.

 A restoration effort this summer is returning the stately old <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber to the way it looked in 1905 when fellows who carried pocket watches and used spittoons debated there. It'll cost the taxpayers $ 21 million before it's over in December, but those purple walls will be a thing of the past.

 Firing volleys of tear gas, riot police on Monday broke off a student march to the North Korean border to press for reunification. Police arrested and beat scores of protesters. About 2,500 students holding red and blue banners tried to march out of <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to go to the border truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, about 30 miles away. Hundreds of riot troopers in green combat fatigues and black-visored helmets confronted students as soon as they exited the main gate. Some officers were seen beating students with riot shields and making flkying karate kicks at fleeing protesters. The students did not fight back and most were unarmed except for a few carrying clubs. Some students hurled a few stones, but the protesters only fought back with clubs and rocks when the police charged into the campus. Dozens of students seized by police huddled on the ground, clinging to each other as police hit and kicked them. Some students cried with pain and senior police officers hit some of their own troopers to try and stop the beating. The students made three atrempts to march out of the main gate. Each time, they were driven back by charging police and armored vans firing tear gas. The students marched out after a rally to call for reunification with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. They wanted to go to <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> for talks with North Korean student delegates on reuniting the divided Korean pensinsula. The government banned the march and deployed more than 20,000 riot police to stop it. On Sunday, hundreds of students at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> and another college in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> battled riot police with firebombs and rocks, and furious residents demanded a halt to the protests to protect the Olympics. Fewer students appeared to be involved than in clashes on Saturday. The few thousand radicals involved in the protests have virtually no public support and clashes were confined to two or three small areas. Students tried to stage a number of demonstrations in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, but handfuls of protesters were dispersed quickly by hundreds of riot police. Police said more than 5,000 riot troops were deployed to block the protests. National Police Headquarters said hundreds of people were arrested, but it had no overall figures. Officials said 1,027 protesters were arrested in clashes Saturday and 63 troopers injured, most in clashes around <LOCATION> Yonsei </LOCATION>. Police halted and searched students entering or leaving <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. Dozens of students were arrested and troops were seen beating and kicking some detainees. Angry residents and shopkeepers staged several counter-protests to demand that students stop violent demonstrations. Onlookers heckled student demonstrators in the city. `` No firebombs by students,'' they shouted. About 200 residents went to the main gate of <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> Sunday to demand students end the protest, but the students refused. Citizens also argued with protesters near the city's <LOCATION> Myondong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cathedral </LOCATION>, accusing them of sabotaging the Summer Olympics scheduled to begin in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Sept. 17. People told the students their protests embarrassed the nation. A column of about 1,000 people who said they belonged to the previously unknown `` Youth League for Protection of the Nation'' staged a march in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, chanting: `` Successful Olympics and economic development.'' Dozens of onlookers applauded. Students attacked some of the group's marchers with sticks and rocks near <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> before being driven off by police. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> warned Friday that violent protests were a threat to the Olympics and had to be stopped. Radical students have seized on the reunification issue to try to mobilize public support for their anti-government campaign. The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have failed to gain support because of violent tactics and open advances to the communist north. The students say they are not communists but insist the peninsula be reunited immediately, with political differences to be worked out later. Most South Koreans fear the north is determined to conquer them. The radical students also demand removal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The Korean peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War.

 Citing the potential of terrorist attack, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are putting the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on notice that they will strongly oppose any move to permit sea shipment of plutonium from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Here you have an administration that is supposedly waging a war on terrorism, but promoting a policy that could make terrorism easy,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The issue stems from a recently signed U.S.-Japan nuclear cooperation treaty that authorizes shipments by air of plutonium from reprocessing plants in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> back to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where it will be used to fuel nuclear power plants. The plutonium, which also could be utilized for nuclear weapons, is controlled by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government because the nuclear fuel originated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Proceeding with the air shipments was made contingent upon development of crash-proof shipping casks, which so far has proven unachievable. In the face of that, the Japanese have been seeking to amend the nuclear cooperation treaty to give 30-year advance approval for shipment by sea. Such a `` subsequent arrangement'' must be reviewed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> said late last week that amending the U.S.-Japan accord would face significant opposition on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have a 15-day review period when it will be very difficult for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to explain how, if we are not shipping plutonium by air because it is not yet safe, we can consider shipping plutonium by sea, which is a proven danger,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat joined with 13 other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and four senators in sending a letter this month to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, expressing their concern over reports that his administration has agreed in principle to allow sea shipment. They cited a March 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> study which said `` the Office of the Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, joint staff and services have concluded that air shipment via the polar route is preferable to sea shipment.'' The study warned that during sea shipment `` the vessel is accessible and vulnerable throughout the voyage, particularly when the vessel is passing through channels, straits, and other restricted waterways -LRB- ` choke points' -RRB-, or when it is near the coast.'' `` Even if the most careful precautions are observed no one could guarantee the safety of the cargo from a security incident, such as an attack on the vessel by small, fast craft, especially if armed with modern anti-ship missiles,'' it said. The only previous sea shipment of plutonium from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> took place in 1984, when the cargo ship was escorted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, French and Japanese naval vessels and monitored constantly by satellite. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> dealt with the plutonium issue in a May 30 letter to members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations committees. In the letter, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said: `` The administration will consider programmatic shipment of plutonium under adequate physical security pursuant to the implementing agreement. Such an arrangement would be treated by the administration as a subsequent arrangement in accordance with Section 131 of the Atomic Energy Act.'' A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said: `` The government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> approached the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government on this issue and requested discussions. Officials of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> met in July to begin the discussions, and further discussions are taking place in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' He said there was no indication how long the talks would continue. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has said it expects that each sea shipment would involve more than 200 kilograms, or 440 pounds, of plutonium. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based nuclear non-proliferation policy group, approximately 15 pounds of plutonium would be enough to make a nuclear weapon. `` This transportation controversy underscores the very real dangers of civilian plutonium commerce,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuperman </PERSON>, the institute's issues director. `` It should prompt <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to reconsider its commitment to recycling plutonium.''

 Should you give money to a beggar? Some people who work with the down and out say you should, while others believe the most charitable response is to say `` no.'' Last week, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> announced an advertising program to discourage people from giving money. `` In most cases, in my judgment, the money that you give in the street to beggars goes for booze and drugs,'' said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. A person or persons unknown rented four billboards last month in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to say: `` Please do n't give to beggars _ they cause traffic problems.'' Many of the beggars cross from <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Downtown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> distributes brochures advising: `` Give a hand, not a handout.'' `` The main reason people are panhandling is to support alcohol and drug problems,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMaster </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Burnside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION>, which runs a shelter for street people in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` I am absolutely convinced that if people did n't give money to panhandlers, the matter of panhandling would be drastically reduced, and more people would be forced to come in for alcohol and drug treatment.'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, Project Director of Health Care for the Homeless in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, said money given to beggars may only encourage a drug or alcohol habit. `` I do n't give money to people in the street and I tell my friends not to,'' Ms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` You never know where the money is going.'' <ORGANIZATION> Gloria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a shelter in west <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said there is no right or wrong response. `` It really has much more to do with my own wanting to take the opportunity to give something to somebody.'' <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON>, social services secretary for the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said an encounter with a beggar could be positive even if no money is given. `` I would hope people would internalize that, and ask themselves, why are people on the street asking for money?'' `` I think it's important to make a decision about whether or not you're going to give someone money, not just to walk away or assume they're going to use it for a drink or something harmful,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, director of community relations and advocacy for the Pine Street Inn shelter in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` You just ca n't ignore people,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added. `` The tip is to look at a beggar as another person with real needs.''

<HEAD>Navy Mum on Report Only One Officer to Be Disciplined</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> should receive a report this week from a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> board that investigated the downing of an Iranian passenger airliner by the USS Vincennes, the Pentagon says. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> confirmed on Sunday that the panel has completed its work, but he refused to discuss a published report saying the board recommended disciplinary action against only one officer aboard the ship. All 290 people aboard the plane were killed when it was shot down over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on July 3. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> had misidentified the plane as an F-14 fighter. `` The report went up, and, if not already, will be in the hands of the -LRB- defense -RRB- secretary this week,'' <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. `` We expect a public report in the near future.'' <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> refused to discuss a story in Sunday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which said the board's report calls for disciplining only the ship's operations officer. The story said that officer, who has not been identified publicly, drew most of the blame for his role in misinterpreting information that resulted in a decision to fire on the plane. The newspaper said the report reaches the general conclusion that the tragedy resulted from a series of human errors, not from any major malfunction in the ship's sophisticated Aegis radar systems. The Post quoted <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying the report of the investigating team, headed by Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>, could be changed before it is made public. However, the story added, the officials said there is little inclination to go hard on any <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel connected with the downing of the jet, from Rear Adm. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Less, commander of the naval task force in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, to the sailors who misinterpreted the radar data. The proposed discipline against the operations officer would be one of the lightest available to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>: a letter of reprimand that would not made a part of the officer's permanent record.

 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the esteemed trial lawyer and sports entrepreneur, rarely appeared in court when it was not crowded with fellow attorneys who wanted to see a master at work. `` He was a role model for every honest, tough criminal lawyer in the postwar era,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON>, a criminal lawyer and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> law school professor. Lawyer <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, an adviser to presidents, said, `` The bar has lost perhaps its most outstanding advocate.''

A funeral mass for <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> will be held Tuesday at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Matthew </LOCATION>'s Cathedral here where he often attended morning mass before he went to work a few blocks away.

 Videotapes of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s confrontational testimony before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year are for sale at the Republican National Convention, but the indicted former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide is not here in the flesh Neither are former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, ex-White House aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> nor a host of other one-time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials whose ethical conduct was questioned. An exception is <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former political director who was convicted of illegally lobbying the executive branch. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said he planned to help former Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> with his convention speech. This is Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convention, and the soon-to-be <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee obviously wants to distance himself from what critics have called the administration's `` sleaze factor.'' `` He is an honest, open, ethical person who has high standards for himself and the people around him,'' said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>. Another Midwesterner, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can insulate himself from ethical criticism by building a `` wall of credibility'' around himself. As a first step, <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must select aides and associates whose behavior is beyond reproach. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has stressed his openness by releasing financial data, including his tax returns and a statement from his doctor about his medical condition. The vice president also suggested that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s conduct did not meet the standards he would set for his Cabinet members, though he never called for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s resignation. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who left office last Friday, said he strongly supports <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination, but planned to take a vacation with his family this week. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> investigated <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s conduct while in office. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said he would not bring charges against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, although <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> probably violated conflict-of-interest and tax laws. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> denied any wrongdoing, and compared his case to that of former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> who was acquitted on fraud charges. The Republicans have touched briefly on ethics in their platform, focusing exclusively on activities of the Democrat-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, primarily the House. In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` outright offenses against ethical standards and public laws are treated lightly,'' and members `` protect their cronies charged with personal misconduct or criminal activities,'' the document says. While more than a dozen <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials have left under a cloud, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> doubted the Democrats would make a big deal about the issue during the 1988 presidential campaign. `` It's a bum issue for the Democrats to pursue; they could find themselves hoist by their own petards,'' he said. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, is the subject of an investigation by the ethics committee. The panel has hired an independent counsel to look into large royalties <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received from a book published by a campaign contributor. `` There is sleaze on both sides,'' said <PERSON> Clopha </PERSON> <PERSON> Deshotel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative lobbying group that is selling the <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> videotapes for $ 25, along with pictures of North for $ 5 and bumper stickers that say `` Pardon Ollie'' and `` Two Wrongs Make A Wright.'' North and his ex-boss, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, are awaiting trial on charges of conspiracy to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for their role in the Iran-Contra affair. North also is charged with accepting gratuities and destroying documents. North, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, has hit the lecture circuit, receiving as much as $ 25,000 a speech. He also has campaigned for Republican candidates in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. But Republican officials say they have no word that <PERSON> North </PERSON> will appear at the convention. Said <PERSON> Deshotel </PERSON>: `` It would be like <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>; he would upstage the event.'' The allegations against administration officials vary widely. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, the former deputy chief of staff, was convicted of perjury in an ethics investigation. Others convicted were <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavelle </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s toxic waste clean-up program who was found guilty of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON>, a deputy secretary of defense who served 19 months for lying about insider stock trading, and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClain </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddow </PERSON>, a top official at <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> who pleaded guilty to pocketing $ 55,330 from a non-profit foundation he started. Others who ran into trouble were <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a former national security adviser who resigned amid questions about his acceptance of gifts from the Japanese; <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorsuch </PERSON> <PERSON> Burford </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator who resigned amid allegations of agency mismanagement and possible conflict of interest, and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, former administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> who resigned after reports that he was involved in questionable business dealings.

<HEAD>Ordinance Aimed At Aggressive Begging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM KLAHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An ordinance aimed at aggressive beggars seems to have reduced the number of confrontations between panhandlers and pedestrians, but did n't prevent the death of a passerby who said no. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s law went into effect Nov. 27, after years of attempts by some officials and downtown businessmen alarmed by pushy beggars. The law has served as a model for at least two other cities. `` There has been a significant reduction in the amount of aggressive behavior along with panhandling,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Deschane </PERSON>, commander of the city's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Precinct </LOCATION>, which includes the <LOCATION> Pioneer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> district, where many confrontations took place before the ordinance went into effect. `` Some of them were pretty frightening,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Downtown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't see them there anymore.'' Still, on July 9, a man who told a woman panhandler to get a job was knocked unconscious by the woman's boyfriend, and died two days later, authorities said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nightwolf </PERSON>, who had a record of violent behavior, was charged with second degree murder, said homicide Sgt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>. The ordinance, which prohibits panhandlers from intimidating or blocking passersby, carries a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail and a $ 500 fine. <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> enacted an ordinance in February making it illegal to use offensive language, grab or follow someone if it `` reasonably tends to arouse alarm or anger.'' Violations are punishable by up to 90 days in jail and $ 700 fines. `` It really has n't been as effective an ordinance as it could be,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, the councilman who sponsored <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>' ordinance `` If -LRB- police -RRB- would just begin to arrest and take them off the street, and get them a warning that they can go to court.'' <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said he could not say how many arrests had been made, because begging is lumped with public drunkenness and similar offenses. `` The ordinance made it easier to prosecute. It did n't make it easier to enforce,'' he said. A similar ordinance, enacted in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, in April 1987, was n't specifically aimed at begging but prohibits interfering with pedestrians or with people leaving and entering public or private property. The law has been used to arrest anti-abortion protesters as well as street people. `` That particular ordinance has been a failure as far as doing what I expected it to do,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachsmuth </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Dan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. The panhandlers `` have no fear of the police. I tell them to leave, and they tell me to go jump in the lake.'' <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> police Capt. <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> acknowledged that the ordinance has been used sparingly. `` The problem is that we have to see -LRB- an offense -RRB- occurring. Most people who are harassed do n't report it,'' she said The city commission in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, approved an ordinance July 15, based on <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s, that makes it a violation to repeatedly beg _ more than once an hour _ for money or to obstruct a pedestrian's passage while begging Violators can be fined $ 100. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> police made 121 arrests under its law in the first half of this year, but <PERSON> Deschane </PERSON> said the threat of arrest has been most important for officers. `` They can simply warn people, which works remarkably well,'' he said. Aggressive panhandling, which was the most frequent complaint in the precinct last summer, has dropped below on-the-street narcotics dealing and public drinking this summer, <PERSON> Deschane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Downtown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said official concern is overblown. In five years working downtown, he said, he never witnessed such panhandling. `` It seems to me, most of it is done in an almost polite, ingratiating fashion,'' he said, adding many of downtown's beggars are impaired by mental illness and alcoholism. A municipal court judge in May ruled that <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, but <PERSON> Deschane </PERSON> said other municipal judges have not embraced that view. Until a higher court rules, he said, `` we're still enforcing the law.'' <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said the business association is trying to persuade those who give to beggars to donate instead to shelters serving the homeless. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where there is no ordinance against begging, Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> made a similar suggestion last week. The <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> association publishes a brochure that gives this advice: `` Give a hand, not a handout.''

 Black and Hispanic Republicans had kind words for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s minority hiring record, but grumbled about the opening today of a national convention overwhelmingly dominated by white men. `` What we have to do is start making ourselves known at the local level,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a black delegate from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` Hopefully, four years from now, the dismal, small number will be increased. `` I do n't want anyone taking me for granted,'' he said. More than 1,000 delegates and activists gathered on the outskirts of the sweltering convention city Sunday night for an evening-long tribute to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s role in naming minority group members to his administration. They also gave him credit for boosting the economy, which they called the best possible program for the poor. `` You've got a tremendous record here,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION>, the group organizing the tribute. `` You ca n't get any economic clout if you ca n't get a job.'' But there was an undercurrent of unhappiness about this week's convention, with just over 92 percent white delegates, compared to 68 percent at last month's Democratic National Convention Roughly 3 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates are black. `` It's too low, we all know that,'' said <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and a black <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appointee honored at the meeting. `` The party has to do more than just passively sit back. We want to be critical without being antagonistic.'' The gathering was held in a sprawling, corrugated metal building miles from the Superdome where the convention kicks off today. The building houses floats used in <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> Gras parades, so activists milled about under giant papier-mache caricatures of kings and revelers and occasionally posed for pictures next to the more outrageous examples. At one point, activists argued that Republicans can lure more black voters, while the strains of `` Dixie'' wafted from the bandstand. The song, which expresses nostalgia for the old <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, is considered offensive to some blacks. Neighbors in the heavily black section of the city looked on curiously from across the street. The Republican convention city is 55.1 percent black. There has been criticism over the past week about the tiny minority population to be seated in the Superdome today. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> who is black, said Republicans are too leery of newcomers regardless of race. `` I think there is a problem with the representational structure of the party,' he said. <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> was in an earlier flap with convention organizers that underscored the occasionally tense relations between the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and minorities. He is scheduled to address the convention Wednesday, and publicly complained that organizers wanted him to emphasize his race in the speech. Another criticism of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> organizers came earlier in the day from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rondeno </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> financial planner running a reception center for delegates favoring vanquished presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> right now is limited,'' said <PERSON> Rondeno </PERSON>. `` Unfortunately, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been the party of ` keep it small and keep it all'. Blacks in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were totally excluded from this convention.'' Most attending Sunday night's dinner and reception, however, preferred to stress the potential gain for both minorities and Republicans in a stronger relationship. But they made it clear that the party's establishment must extend a hand in welcome. `` That's what the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has to do, open up its doors,'' said <PERSON> Californian </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` The party has to have more blacks at all levels, at all echelons.'' `` This is designed to let the convention know there are minorities who do support the ticket,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, businessman who organized the group. King shrugged off questions about the number of blacks and other minorities at the convention. `` I think that's basically the way things are,'' he said. `` There are not a lot of black Republicans.''

<TEXT>
 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks Sunday at a welcoming rally on the eve of the Republican National Convention Thank you. It's great to be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. You know, I always feel at home here in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, because, you know, I'm the fellow that talked <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> into buying it. I'm really looking forward to tomorrow night in the Superdome. It's going to prove something I've always suspected, that when I finally got to the home of the <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>, it would be filled with Republicans. I can understand the opposition rejecting <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> as their convention city, though. They really would have had trouble readjusting here _ after all, they think the Sugar Bowl is located in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and is known as the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. But I can guarantee one site here would have made them feel at home. We Republicans love our bandwagon, but all that other party's got is a streetcar named Desire This may surprise you, but today I want to point out similarities between myself and both of the nominees at the top of the other ticket. You see, in one way, I'm just like their vice presidential nominee. Neither one of us shares the political views of their presidential nominee. Well, come to think of it, I do have one thing in common with the fella at the top of their ticket _ come this January, neither one of us will be holding a federal office.

 But, I confess to all of you, I did miss that other convention this summer. I did read, though, all about it, those great issues and ideas, and I've got to admit I found them pretty interesting when I first heard them back some years ago. But, believe me, I know better than to even mention their platform in a city that takes such pride in its cuisine, its cooking. Who would dare discuss in front of the proud people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> anything so rehashed, so reheated and so often rejected? But ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that platform was one of the most artful dodges in American political history. It was an outright refusal by the liberal leadership of the other party to level with the American, to deal with the issues, to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, especially independents and rank-and-file Democrats, what the liberal leadership really has in store for us should they be victorious. And they gave us one, huge, glaring clue to all that when they said at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention, this was a campaign about competence, not ideology. Now, let's be honest. If they really were a campaign about competence, if they were really a battle of the resumes, I just happen to think that the former captain of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> foot _ baseball team, the youngest flier in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> with 58 combat missions, the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> wildcatter who turned down a soft job on Wall Street to make his own way, the former member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> national chairman _ hang on, there's more _ the former ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the former de factor ambassador in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the director of central intelligence, and the current vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, who's handed every tough issue from deregulation, to drugs, to terrorism, frankly I think the fellow with that resume has it all. So _ -LRB- crowd chants <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s name -RRB- _ you're right. That's his name So, why did they say it? Well, you see when they came right out at that convention and said this is a campaign not about ideology but about competence, they were really telegraphing their greatest weakness, the very thing that worries them and their advisers most, to every state in the union, to every voter in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and that's their liberal record and that of the liberal leadership of their party in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>

<TEXT>
 They know what they intend to do once in office. But they do n't want the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to find out until after the election And that's where we come in. You and me. We Republicans know the truth: that convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was the biggest masquerade since last year's <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. And so we're here this week for one purpose: to get our message to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, to prove to the liberal leadership of the other party, starting here, and starting now, their attempt to hide their stand on the issues is n't going to work. The masquerade is over. The stealth candidacy has to _ to come out from cover. It's time to talk issues, to use the dreaded `` L'' word, to say the policies of our opposition and the congressional leadership of his party are liberal, liberal, liberal. The choice before the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people this year is just as clear as it was in 1980 and 1984. A choice _ a choice between, on the one hand, the policies of limited government, economic growth, a strong defense and a firm foreign policy, and, on the other hand, policies of tax and spend, economic stagnation, international weakness and accommodation, and always, always, always blame <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> first. Yes, the choice this year is between the policies of liberalism or the policies of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s political mainstream.

 But you and I understand that just having Republicans know all this is n't good enough. Our great victories of 1980 and'84 were based on millions of independents and rank and file Democrats who came our way. Their votes _ especially those of traditional Democrats _ is the key battleground. And here we have an advantage: because on economic, social and foreign policy issues, those conservative-minded Democrats agree with us. And, you know, you know, some people _ and I've been a little flattered by this _ refer to this group as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats. Well, well, if it's true, that I have an `` in'' with those Democrats, here's what I want to say to them today, and what I hope you'll say to them when you get back home: `` You're right to feel uncomfortable about the leadership of the party you and I once pledged loyalty to. A party that once stood for the broad interests of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s working men and women has become a party fixated on the narrow agenda of the liberal elites and special interest groups. The power of liberal pressure groups in the party has grown so great that the rest of their candidates this year, the ones who voted for strong defense or tax cuts, did n't even dare to get into the primaries. `` Yes,'' I would say to rank-and-file Democrats, `` a once-proud party of hope and affirmation has become dominated at the top by strident liberalism and negativism. The party of ` yes' has become the party of ` no.' ` No' to holding the line on taxes, ` no' to spending cuts, ` no' to the line-item veto, ` no' to the balanced-budget amendment, ` no' to the death penalty, ` no' to tough-minded judges, ` no' to enterprise zones, ` no' to the school prayer amendment, ` no' to the right to life, ` no' to adequate defense spending, ` no' to a strategic defense system that protects <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from nuclear missiles, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, ` no' to help those _ for fighting for _ keep <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> safe from communism, ` no' to liberating <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, ` no' to a policy in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> that's helped ending war in that region, ` no' to a negotiating stance that has brought us the first nuclear arms reduction treaty in history, ` no' to the foreign policy of strength and purpose that has told the truth about communism and helped bring the first signs of change to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in seven decades And I would also say to those rank-and-file Democrats, `` In all these ways, the liberal leadership of your party has been saying ` no' to you. And now it's time for you to start saying ` no' to them. And the best _ -LRB- crowd chanting `` Just say no'' -RRB- _ all right, the best way to do that is by saying ` yes' to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>; and ` yes'' to a new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that will work with the new president, not against him, a Republican <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. My fellow Republicans, this is the message we must carry to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> this week and beyond. For too long, the control of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been in the hands of the liberal leadership. So let us say to conservative Democrats and independents: `` Do n't cancel out your vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by voting for a senator or representative who will go along with the liberal leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and fight all the good the new president will try to do.''

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: to do.''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 But even beyond that, my fellow conservatives, beyond identifying our sharp differences on the issues and exposing the opposition's attempt to hide its liberalism, there is something else we have to do. As time has gone by, the memory of the economic and foreign policy nightmares that we faced when we took office has faded. And so we have to remind the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people of the record _ of how far we have come. Now, you can be sure the opposition party is n't going to help us here. They're even trying to pretend those economic and foreign policy nightmares they gave us never happened. One political commentator noticed this at their recent convention and, believe me, I just do n't think I can improve on this paragraph. Let me read to you what <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Helprin </PERSON> said. And remember, this is from him now _ not me _ because you know, I might be accused of being biased. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- `` After eight years of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a dozen new or incipient democracies in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, after <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> or proxy withdrawal in process in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the winding down of the Iran-Iraq war, half-a-dozen treaties and summits with a marvelously chastened <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, after the longest peacetime economic expansion in American history, record employment and a two-point drop in the unemployment rate, a significant drop in the crime rate, a 12-point drop in the prime rate, and a 10-point drop in the rate of inflation, not to mention tax reform and an economy that has succeeded in making the stock market crash almost inconsequential, the Democrats trotted out <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to say, ` I told you so,' _ end quote. And you know something, when I saw that happen in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, forgive me, but I could n't help but think, ` There he goes again.''' And, you know, we did n't just see at that convention the desire to forget about the record of chaos their policies gave <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the seventies. We also heard them openly saying they're going to steal our words and slogans _ words like `` community,'' `` family,'' `` values.'' And even more amazing, after eight years of prophesying gloom and predicting doom every night on the evening news, they now want to be _ and are you ready for this _ optimistic and hopeful. You know, that reminds me of a little story. It's about <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>. One dark day <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> went through shirt after shirt after shirt and just could n't get one with all the buttons on it. And finally, losing his patience, he flew into a rage and then used a string of some very choice words. And then, as the story is told, when he was through, he turned and was startled to see his wife standing in the doorway. Carefully, slowly and without a trace of emotion, she repeated every naughty word just uttered by her husband. That took several minutes. And when she was through, she stood impassive in silence, hoping her display would shame <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>. Instead, there was a twinkle in his eye. He said, `` My dear, you have the words. You do n't have the music.'' Well, that's true about the so-called leaders of the other party. They can try and adopt our words, but as long as we Republicans get out there and give the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people the music, there is n't a chance they'll get away with it. So that's the job ahead of us. And you tell me, when the liberals try to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people they wo n't raise taxes but fail to mention the new spending programs they've promised every liberal special interest group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, are we going to stand by and let them get away with it? _ -LRB- Crowd yells, `` No.'' -RRB- When the liberal leadership tries to portray themselves as the newly ordained champions of law and order but forgets to mention they've given a virtual veto power over the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appointments to fellow liberals like the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> _ -LRB- crowd boos -RRB- _ I'm with you _ are we going to stand by and let them get away with it? _ -LRB- crowd yells, `` No.'' -RRB- When the liberal leadership tries to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that they're the party of peace but forgets to admit they jeopardized the chance for peace and tried to tie my hands in arms negotiations by favoring a nuclear freeze, cutting defense, and gutting SDI, are we going to let them get away with it? _ -LRB- Crowd yells, `` No.'' -RRB- I thought you might object. You know, when they start using our words and slogans and then try to tell us that's how they're going to make the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people vote for them in November, it reminds me of that little kid at school who the day after getting his reports card went back to school and said, `` Teacher, I thought somebody should warn you, my dad says that unless my math grades go up, somebody's going to get a whipping. You know what? They're right about one thing The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, just like that young fellow's dad, really are in a mood to settle some important questions this November. And it wo n't be President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a new Republican <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but those liberals from the other party that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people take out behind the barn. So, ladies and gentlemen, we have to get our word out about our own great record. But one other thing, too. Nobody votes for you just to say thank you. Americans can be appreciative about the past but, believe me, Americans vote for a vision of the future.

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: the future.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 So we must talk to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> about her future. We conservatives must go to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and tell them: Even 68 months of economic growth and 17-and-a-half million new jobs is n't good enough for us. We want more _ more growth, more opportunity, more jobs. -LRB- Crowd chants, `` More.'' -RRB- Right. And we intend to ensure this kind of economic prosperity right through the'90s and into the next century by guaranteeing the federal government can never again spend and tax the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people into another economic nightmare. We'll do it by passing the line-item veto, the balanced-budget amendment and limits on congressional taxing power. So too, we never want to see the day when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is more interested in criminal rights than in the rights of the victim and of society itself. You know, the next president may have the opportunity to appoint three and possibly four new justices shortly after taking office. We want to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people what it will mean for their future if it's <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> making those appointments. And finally, finally, there is this one last issue _ Yes, more important than even all the other crucial matters I've discussed with you today. Ladies and gentlemen, when we were together in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in 1980 and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1984, I wonder how many of us could really have believed then that so many of our fondest hopes and dreams for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> would come true. And of all those things that have happened, how many of us could have imagined eight or even four years ago that one day I would have the opportunity to stand as I did a few months ago there in the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> _ at a podium at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> _ and tell the young people of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> about the wonder and glory of human freedom. And here is the _ here is the _ crux, the heart of the matter. With the beginnings of change we've seen in the Eastern Bloc, and with the developments of concepts like SDI that destroy weapons, not people, it is just possible, just possible that we have a chance now to end the two great nightmares of this century and give our children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror. My fellow Republicans, we have proved that what works in foreign policy is exactly the opposite of the policies of our opposition. We have demonstrated time and again that plain talk, a strong defense, and tough diplomacy, bring peace. What a great moment we have before us and, oh, how future generations will dishonor us if, now, in a moment of sudden folly, we throw it all away. And this is what is now at stake. We must hold to this moment of hope _ and I tell you with every ounce of energy and every fiber of my being, only electing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can accomplish that. So, so let us go forth this week, to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people what's really at stake: The fate of generations to come, the hopes of peace and freedom for our children, for all the children of the world. Do n't let anyone tell you this is just another campaign. Do n't let anyone tell you that we're just good administrators out to renew our management contract Instead, remember this: This is n't a campaign, it's a crusade, a crusade for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future. And this too: We are n't just good conservative managers, we are the keepers of the flame, the protectors of the dream _ the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream that someday freedom will be the blessing and the birthright of every people in every nation across God's greening Earth. This is a dream worth protecting and one, believe me, that needs protecting. Protection from those who would squander it away with special interest spending, for those who would tax the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people into servitude, those who would make leniency not justice the hallmark of our courtrooms, and those who would risk a Soviet base camp in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, those who would cut defense or end SDI or return us to weakness and accommodation abroad. No, my fellow Republicans, this is not the future our fellow Americans want. So, let us go to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. Let us tell them of our vision, of the future we offer. A future of economic growth and opportunity and democratic revolution and peace among nations. And let us remind them too of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s destiny, of our great calling as a people. And let us take them to a place where they can see with us that hilltop just now being glimpsed through the dark but dispersing clouds of 20th century tragedy, let us help them look from there upon that shining city we have seen and labored for and loved so long, a city aglow with the light of human freedom, a light that someday will cast its glow on every dark corner of the world and on every age and generation to come. My fellow Republicans, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs the strength, the vision and the true grit of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. And almost, and after almost half-a-century of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congresses </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs a Republican <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. And you and I are going to give her both. Let's do this for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Thank you, and God bless you all.

<HEAD>Study: Lowering Expectations Of Help From Alcohol Helps Deter
Drinking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 College students reduced their drinking more if their assumptions about alcohol's benefits were challenged than if they were warned about its dangers, psychologists say. `` We're looking at this as an approach to prevention'' of problem drinking, said researcher <PERSON> Renelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. Study results support a theory that one reason people drink is because they think it will make them funny, brave, more sociable, sexier, more assertive or better in some other way, she said. Levels of such `` expectancies'' have been linked to alcohol consumption in previous studies, she said in an interview Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting. Her study, done with <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> of the university, included female college students who said they drank moderately. After the students recorded their normal alcohol consumption for three weeks, 25 were assigned to a program to lower their alcohol expectancies, 25 others to a more traditional program that focused on dangers of excessive drinking, and 27 to receive no training at all. For one activity in the expectancies program, students of legal age were given either an alcoholic beverage or a placebo, but they were not told which. Afterward, the group played charades. Then, those students and the under-age members of the group were asked to guess who had gotten alcohol, on the basis of their performance. `` Everybody made mistakes,'' <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said. Their inaccuracy led to a discussion of how people have been led to believe through television, advertising and everyday conversation that alcohol can make people sexy, funny and so on. Participants also were asked to look for songs, advertisements and other places `` where they may be told alcohol is going to do good things for you,'' she said. The impact on their drinking habits a month after the program shows that examining expectancies and demonstrating how misleading they are `` is a lot more potent than just telling people about the potential hazards of excessive drinking,'' <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said. To analyze the effect of the experimental and traditional programs, researchers divided the students into 36 low-level and 41 high-level drinkers, depending on whether they had drunk fewer or more than eight drinks per week before the training. The expectancies training made both groups cut back significantly. High-level drinkers went from an average of 9.7 drinks a week to 6.1, while low-level students dropped from 5.5 drinks to four. In contrast, the traditional program affected only the low-level drinkers significantly, reducing their consumption from 6.4 to three drinks a week. High-level drinkers changed only from 10.9 drinks to 9.4 drinks weekly. Future programs may be able to target particular expectancies and provide an alternative to alcohol, <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said. For example, people who think alcohol would make them more social could be taught social skills, like how to meet people, she said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, assistant professor of psychology at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and an alcohol researcher, said <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>'s experiment was well done and the results make sense. But such research must look at changes in other expectancies besides just positive ones, he said. People also hold notions that alcohol can be bad for their health and their self-control, and those ideas also play a role in how much people drink and whether drinking becomes a problem, he said.

<HEAD>French Quarter Has More Than ``Strong Drink At Conservative

 `` Authentic Democratic Voodoo Dolls'' sold for $ 2.98 and <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s Irish Pub poured <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> cocktails _ `` strong drink at conservative prices; <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> on tap.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> costumed itself in <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> finery for conventioneers wandering its sultry streets. It stuffed its shop windows with elephants and its visitors with oysters. And, like a <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION> reveler, it kept a part of itself under wraps. `` I think they might've put some of the bums in jail,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, a waitress at the Original Old Absinthe House on <LOCATION> Bourbon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where the likes of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> once bellied up to the bar. `` I have n't seen the usual prostitutes, either.'' Off <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the heaps of trash longtime resident <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Esolen </PERSON> described as `` an urban horror'' had disappeared. More dramatic, to French Quarter gallery owner <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, was a transformed railroad overpass between the airport and downtown <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` For 364 days a year, it's got the most disgusting graffiti you've ever seen,'' <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. `` Now, they have it painted pastel colors _ peach, lavender and aqua. Suddenly, it is to die! It's under 24-hour guard to make sure it stays that way. `` The city has never looked better,'' added <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, who'd even heard that mint was being dumped into city sewer lines to further sweeten things up for the visitors. `` I do n't know if it's true. But it does show the extent to which we feel the eyes of the world on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>.'' On <LOCATION> Bourbon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, the carousing capital of the city, waitress <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> thought the party was getting off to a slow start. She'd been looking forward to the Republicans' arrival for weeks Now that they're here, `` they're turning out to be cheap.'' Taxi driver <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>, on the other hand, had hung a stuffed elephant from his rear view mirror in tribute to some `` excellent'' tipping. And <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, a `` Kennedy Democrat,'' was keeping his bases covered, with a $ 6,800 gold and ivory elephant prominently displayed in the front window of his shop. It was there, in the heart of the French Quarter, that the Republicans congregated, sampling the rich gumbo of cultures: French, Spanish, <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, Italian. They took in the jazz musicians, the voodoo dolls, and the crabs. But <PERSON> Esolen </PERSON> says the more subtle qualities of the quarter must be appreciated. `` As you wander the streets, there's a sense of scale that is such that a human being is welcome,'' said <PERSON> Esolen </PERSON>. `` You can imagine yourself in every nook and cranny, in the light of a balcony window, the glimpse of a patio. `` At the same time, much of its architecture looks inward. The French Quarter is a place of secrets.''

<HEAD>Bio: Lennon Kicked Heroin Habit By `Floating'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> kicked a heroin habit with the help of a sensory-deprivation tank and felt as healthy as he'd ever felt in the weeks before his murder, according to a new biography. <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> kicked the debilitating habit in 1979 with self-discipline and a cedarwood box filled with a warm saline solution in which he would float for up to half an hour in the dark, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> writes in `` The Lives Of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>.'' The sensation reminded him of getting high, according to the excerpts of the book published in this week's People magazine. In November 1980, following the release of his and <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>'s album, `` Double Fantasy,'' he called producer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> was totally satisfied with himself mentally and physically,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said. `` He was starting to make a break. It had to do with his 40th birthday. He told me: ` I'm happy to be 40 years old. I'm in the best shape I've ever been in my life and I feel the best I ever felt.''' The book says <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> experienced hallucinations and threatened suicide, but kicked her heroin habit with the help of a physician. Once off the drug, and encouraged by a friend, according to <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION>, she wrote most of the songs for `` Double Fantasy'' and `` Milk and Honey'' in a week.

<TEXT>
 There are no rats, empty crack vials or gang members outside at <PERSON> Elyse </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>' apartment, but the former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> welfare mother who's on a graduate fellowship at the University of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> still locks her door. Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who is working on her Ph.D. and has her sights on a career in academia, jokes about her new suburban life here. `` I have to contend with a whole new set of problems, like getting grass stains out of my laundry,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 35. But three years ago, while living in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> in a rat-infested apartment building frequented by drug users and gangs members, her problems were much bigger. Her husband left, leaving her to raise their four children on $ 950 a month in welfare payments and food stamps. Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who dropped out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> after one year when she was 17, decided on an impulse to return to college. She enrolled at <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, relying on her oldest daughter, <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION>, now 17, to watch the three other children while she took classes and studied at night. `` It was horrible. It was terrifying for me to leave them in that apartment,'' she said. `` There were leaks from the ceiling, the second bathroom had collapsed. We had the usual assortment of rats, mice and roaches. `` It was just ugly and dirty and horrible,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said in her living room in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> strewn with boxes of unpacked books. `` All the time it was just fear, shaking fear.'' Her other children _ <PERSON> Damian </PERSON>, 11, <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, 9 _ were kept indoors while she went to classes. `` They looked imprisoned, pale and sickly,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. `` I, at least, had the advantage of being in school, having my nose in a book.'' At <LOCATION> Lehman </LOCATION>, she studied English and the humanities in the Adult Degree Program, carrying up to 52 credits a year. She earned straight A's, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in June. Her accomplishment attracted national attention, which she found irritating. `` They implied that well, this is it. Poor, <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> mother on welfare makes good, end of story. The way I look at it, that was just the first act,'' she said. Fellowship offers for a graduate degree poured in and Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> knew she did n't want to stay in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> would point out these little plastic things she'd see on the porch and say, ` See Mommy, that's a crack vial.' When an 9-year-old knows what a crack vial is, it's time to get out,'' she said. After considering offers `` from most of the schools in the Big 10,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> accepted <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s, where she will pursue a Ph.D. in English literature. `` I knew of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s reputation because of its Writers Workshop, which is world famous,'' she said. `` I've always wanted to be a creative writer.'' She still marvels at the direction her life has taken. `` I never thought I'd get to graduate school,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. `` It never occurred to me that I could go to graduate school because I never thought I could support myself and my children. `` But people kept encouraging me at <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> to try out. They said I was just born to be a teacher.'' In addition to a $ 17,000 salary stipend and tuition waiver included with the teaching fellowship, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> agreed to waive the tuition for <ORGANIZATION> Rochelle </ORGANIZATION>, who has enrolled as a freshman. Despite her achievements, Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> is afraid. `` I'm scared here because I was a big fish in a little pond at <LOCATION> Lehman </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` I'm a little scared because I want to see what the competition is going to be like. `` What frightens me is not living up to the promise the English Department sees in me,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. `` I want to do well as much for them as for myself.''

 Striking submarine builders at Electric Boat could torpedo their futures if they do n't acknowledge the increasing competitive marketplace and tightening military budget, analysts say. Despite a low unemployment rate and shortage of skilled workers, conditions that should favor the union, defense industry analysts say Electric Boat holds the upper hand in the 6-week-old strike by the 10,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The union struck over <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION>'s demand that employees accept lump-sum bonuses instead of wage increases in a three-year contract. The company says it needs to bring down labor costs to become more competitive with its <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> rival, <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> and Dry Dock Co. The union said the offer does n't take into account <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s higher cost of living. In only the second negotiating session since the strike began, the company Thursday offered bonuses of 5 percent and 4 percent in the first two years and a 3 percent wage increase in the third year, in addition to a $ 600 bonus. The union, which said the offer was not even worth putting to a vote, has asked for wage increases of 5 percent the first year and 4 percent the final two years of the contract. The company said that as of Friday, 668 workers had crossed picket lines. During a five-month strike in 1975, only 150 workers were reported to have done so. Electric Boat's efforts to hire replacement workers, which have included placing full-page ads in newspapers, have produced meager results. Only 20 people have signed up, about the number of workers the sub builder loses each week through attrition. Electric Boat could hurt itself more by acceding to the union's demands and settling quickly than by holding out, despite the low jobless rate and shortage of skilled workers, analysts say Electric Boat, a division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>, has lost six attack submarine contracts in the last two years to <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION>. Electric Boat was awarded only one of three this year; <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> had bid on only two. In all, <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> has contracts for seven Trident subs and nine attack subs. The company is the only builder of the Trident. First-class mechanics, a job classification covering more than 85 percent of Electric Boat's sub builders, earn $ 12.02 an hour. The same workers at <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> earn $ 1.24 less an hour in wages and benefits, according to Electric Boat. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is going to the lowest bidder, and that has predominantly been <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. I do n't know what the union expects the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to do,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. While Electric Boat is making money on the production of Trident submarines, it has not been making money on attack subs for some time, which is `` a further reason for them to hold out longer,'' <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think the union has much bargaining strength,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>. Also working in the company's favor is the tightening military budget, said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION>. Electric Boat has reassigned about 1,800 salaried workers to jobs performed by strikers. It has also shifted work to yards in <LOCATION> Quonset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, where all sub construction begins, and in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, S.C. While certain vendors and small groceries around the shipyard here have suffered, the heavy tourist trade has kept business brisk elsewhere, said <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, head of the regional <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` No one has said to me yet, ` God, the strike is really hurting.' If the strike continues into the fall and winter then we would begin to be able to see an impact,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says he will break bread with <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> then pick up his fast when the 61-year-old farm workers union leader resumes eating after nearly a month. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>' may end his fast this week, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Cesar can not bear the cross alone. The suffering must be shared,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Sunday, before a rally of at least 2,700 people at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> compound in <LOCATION> Delano </LOCATION>, 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` When -LRB- <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> -RRB- comes off the fast, I will pick up the baton and take another lap,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the crowd. He encouraged others to fast for two or three days to support the union's 4-year-old boycott of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grapes. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> raised hands with actors <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> amid chants of `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> was scheduled to attend the rally but did n't because of his weakened condition. He has lost more than 26 pounds since beginning his water-only fast on July 17 to protest the use of pesticides the union says threaten workers, consumers and the environment. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Table </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says the boycott has not affected sales. State officials and grape growers deny that table grapes contain dangerous pesticide residues. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met privately with <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> in a room at the union's retirement village before Sunday's rally An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter and photographer were allowed to briefly observe their meeting, but the conversation could not be heard. It was the first time <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> allowed media to see him in the room where he has been living during the fast. Dressed in light blue pajamas and lying on a bed, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> appeared motionless during his talk with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. He has refused to talk with reporters. Asked at a news conference about <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>'s condition, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` Whatever he may have lost in physical strength, he has more than compensated in spiritual strength and in determination.'' `` Our willingess for decent conditions for workers is an unending struggle,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` We are here today because that struggle continues.'' <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> entered the 30th day of his fast today. His longest fast was 25 days in 1968. He also fasted 24 days in 1972 to advance workers' rights issues. `` He's getting a little weaker every day,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartmire </PERSON> who disclosed that <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> did not attend Mass on Saturday night, the first evening he has missed Mass since beginning the fast.

 About 3,600 Republicans went to the zoo to mix it up with <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON>, the Very Important Pachyderm. `` It's a wonderful elephant, obviously Republican,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milke </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delegate and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> city councilwoman. In a city that never stops partying, today's events include a fete for Republican lawmakers at the <LOCATION> Bourbon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> home of a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congresswoman and a salute to die-hard delegates still pledged to <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> for president. <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON>, an orphaned African elephant, got gushing attention at the three-hour Elephant Romp Welcome, a lavish affair for which corporations contributed $ 150,000 to foot the bill. `` All this attention has kind of spoiled her,'' said handler <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Holston </PERSON> of <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON>. `` She's just a 3-year-old baby _ but she weighs 1,200 pounds,'' he said. Revelers beat steamy heat in four air-conditioned zoo tents, where they two-stepped to Cajun music and traded quips with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Prudhomme </PERSON>, the popular <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> chef. `` We'll throw them a helluva party as long as they're paying,'' <PERSON> Prudhomme </PERSON> said as he hacked chunks of butter for chicken etoufee. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>, jaunty in rainbow-colored suspenders and a white cap, twirled his wife, <PERSON> Mel </PERSON>, to encourage others to get on the wooden-plank dance floors. `` This is a waltz, and we just did a two-step, easy dances,'' he said. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s, which claims to dispense more alcohol than any bar in the world, prepared 2,000 potent Hurricanes in 15-ounce paper cups. The usual dose is 28 ounces and the hardy guzzler keeps the glass. `` This is the official drink, and we want the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to try it,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. The mission of the Elephant Romp Welcome was to provide a three-week dose of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in three hours, said city Councilman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON>, a Democrat. `` A philosophy of this party, I think, would be that in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, we believe that throwing a party, hosting a party, really is an art. It really is a science,'' Early said. Rep. <PERSON> Lindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., planned to open her 193-year-old French Quarter home today for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` They're not overrunning my house.

 It took a few takes, but a peace activist got his message across after breaking a 63-day fast with a bite from a giant pizza topped with a pepperoni peace sign that he then left for <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> took his crusade against cinema violence and war toys to <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s home Saturday. Although he did n't see the star of the `` Rambo'' movies, the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> activist was more graciously received than in a previous visit to a Stallone residence. During that trip, he was doused with water. On Saturday, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marissa </PERSON>, two friends, reporters and some camera crews watched as he delivered the 3-foot pizza to <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s home and presented the pizza to a housekeeper. To accommodate a TV crew that arrived after the presentation, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> got the pizza back from <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s housekeepers so he could re-enact the presentation. At one point the unwieldy pizza slipped onto the driveway. After his first bite in 63 days, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said he was looking forward `` to watching movies with popcorn again.'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said he had n't stepped on a scale to determine the effects of his liquid-only fast, but noted he had lost three belt notches. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said he had not considered the strategy used by critics of the new film `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' who offered to raise money to buy the film so they could destroy it. `` The peace movement could n't afford that type of thing,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s $ 63 million blood-and-guts `` Rambo III.''

<HEAD>35 Illegal Aliens Found In Boxcar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINGSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirty-five Salvadorans spent five hours inside a sweltering boxcar with almost no ventilation and would likely have died had they not been discovered, authorities said. `` It was well over 100 degrees -LRB- outside -RRB- when we found them,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Border Patrol agent <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said of the illegal aliens found Sunday morning. `` It was probably another 20 to 30 degrees hotter inside the car.'' Officials said the aliens could have suffered the same fate as 18 found dead last summer inside a locked boxcar near the west <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanca </LOCATION>, about 65 miles southeast of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. `` When we opened the car up, the people were pale and real sweaty, and then we transported them to the Border Patrol station in <LOCATION> Kingsville </LOCATION> and gave them water and we fed them,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. The 35 were being held Sunday night, along with a Honduran man and 19 Mexicans who were found outside the locked boxcar, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. The Salvadorans, including two 14-year-old boys, had been locked inside since boarding the Houston-bound freight train in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> at 5 a.m. Those found inside the boxcar said the door was to have been kept open to allow ventilation, but someone closed and locked it at <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. In July 1987, only one of 19 aliens survived after more than 12 hours inside a boxcar where the temperature reached 130 degrees. Authorities said the aliens had been locked inside the car by a smuggler who tossed in railroad spikes for the aliens to chip through the airtight car's heavy wooden floor. On March 21, <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents pulled 46 dehydrated aliens from a sealed boxcar during a sweep of northbound traffic 6 miles north of <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents stationed at <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> reported the aliens aboard the train, said <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kingsville </LOCATION>. `` We followed the train from <LOCATION> Sarita </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kingsville </LOCATION> and saw a number of the aliens riding on gondolas and some riding on grain hoppers,'' <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said. Officials checked the train boxcar by boxcar when it arrived at the <LOCATION> Kingsville </LOCATION> freight yard. The aliens were discovered by an agent who heard voices inside a car with fiberglass insulation, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. The aliens told authorities a man in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> offered to get them to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> for $ 300 to $ 600, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. Officials said the aliens did not know the smuggler's name. Some of the aliens told the agents they had contacted relatives who had sent them money for transportation to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Government Newspaper Condemns Ultra-Nationalist Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In one of the harshest official condemnations to date of a Russian ultra-nationalist group, an editorial in <LOCATION> Izvestia </LOCATION> accused Pamyat of fomenting ethnic strife and demanded a crackdown on its <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> chapter. Pamyat, which has branches in many <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> cities, has been holding outdoor rallies every Thursday in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, and official and unofficial sources say local authorities have done little to stop them. The editorial in Saturday's editions of the government newspaper called for a crackdown on Pamyat, saying it opposes <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wide-ranging reform program. The paper also published a quarter-page letter under the headline `` Unclean Play on Clean Feelings,'' from a group of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> scholars who called Pamyat `` a deadly threat to our future.'' This month, the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> published letters from Soviets blasting Pamyat as racist and fascist. One quoted a speaker at a July 7 rally as demanding deportation of Jews and other `` alien races.'' The Izvestia editorial and letter took the condemnation one step further, calling for a legal crackdown against Pamyat in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. In the letter, 59 staff members of the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oriental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> appealed to the country's prosecutor to break up the group because it violates an article of the Soviet Constitution forbidding propaganda of ethnic and racist strife. `` Pamyat distorts the history of our country,'' the scholars wrote. `` It often uses people's lack of information in matters of history, and speculates on their natural and nobel feeling of love of their homeland and on their wish to make a contribution to the restoration of monuments of Russian culture and to nature conservation.'' The scholars said the group advocates militant nationalism and anti-Semitism. The Izvestia editorial noted that Pamyat often complains about a `` Jewish predominance in Soviet science and culture'' to provoke people. The result, the editors said, is damage to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of perestroika. The Soviet leader's restructuring program embraces social, economic and cultural reforms. `` Pamyat is trying to separate out people's national differences, to sow the seed of destructive hostility, and has come to be directed against and working against perestroika,'' the newspaper said. The scholars, in their letter, complained that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government authorities in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and the local press had taken a passive attitude toward the group. The editors of <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, a centrally controlled newspaper, apparently felt they had to step in, saying they had received many letters protesting Pamyat's activities in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. The editors quoted government officials in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> as saying party officials pressured them into granting Pamyat permission to hold the rallies but that the order was reversed on Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Pamyat ignored the ban and held a rally the next day. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Demin </PERSON>, a Jewish activist in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> who opposes Pamyat, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that police detained and beat him after he showed up at the rally. Earlier last week, another <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> dissident was arrested for trying to unfurl anti-Pamyat posters at an Aug. 4 Pamyat rally.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> delegates to the Republican National Convention hope to offer GOP counterparts from around the country an inside glimpse of their longtime nemesis, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Connecticut Delegates Urged To Preach Virtues Of Moderation</HEAD>

 Some Connecticut Republicans are uneasy with a homestate congresswoman's suggestion that they promote the state's brand of moderate Republicanism during this week's national convention. Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> on Sunday told the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> delegation that more moderate party policies are needed to broaden the party's appeal `` I do n't think it's appropriate,'' said delegate <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozzuto </PERSON>. `` We've determined the candidate, the decision from this point on is much the candidate's choice.''

<HEAD>Zumwalt: Son's Death Pushes Him To Fight Harder For Compensation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who died of cancer two decades after his father ordered use of Agent Orange in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, once swam through water doused with the defoliant to collect weapons from <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> boats. He won over his crew, but that swim may have marked the beginning of his last battle, with the cancer that ended his life Saturday at age 42. Retired Adm. <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the American naval commander in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> who ordered the spraying of the defoliant then thought to be harmless, said his son's death will only push him to work harder to force the government to compensate veterans who suffered from Agent Orange's effects. `` There are still many hundreds of veterans who do need help,'' <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> said the day his son died. `` I believe very strongly now that the evidence is clear that the Agent Orange is responsible for the problems many veterans are having.'' His son was diagnosed in 1983 as having non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Two years later, doctors found he had lymphoma <PERSON> Hodgkins </PERSON> disease. His son, <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, suffers from a congenital dysfunction that confuses his physical senses. The Zumwalts chronicled their battle with cancer in 1986 with the book, `` My Father, My Son,'' which they wrote with author <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pekkanen </PERSON>. The book was made into a television movie in May. <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> said his son was strong until the end, even joking and teasing with relatives during Friday evening. He died in his sleep Saturday morning. `` I do not second guess the decisions Dad made in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, nor do I doubt for a minute that the saving of human life was always his first priority in his conduct of the war,'' the younger <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> once said. `` I have the greatest love and admiration for him as a man, and the deepest respect for him as a military leader.'' <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> was commanding a swift boat along the rivers of the Ca <LOCATION> Mau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> when his father, the youngest man ever to serve as chief of naval operations, ordered the spraying of Agent Orange to save servicemen from being killed by enemy ambushes along the waterways. Before the spraying, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces had a 6 percent casualty rate each month. Afterward, that figure dropped to less than 1 percent. Since the war, the elder <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> and his son had pushed for government assistance to veterans affected by Agent Orange. On June 30, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> removed the last legal obstacle to a $ 180 million settlement between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and the manufacturers of Agent Orange. The justices let stand rulings that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged a 1984 settlement.

 A 9-year-old boy and his aunt drowned in the <LOCATION> Lehigh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as family members watched in horror after the two were swept away while wading across a shallow area below a dam, authorities say. <PERSON> Emisilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, 41, and her nephew <PERSON> Lizandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> were pronounced dead of accidental drowning Sunday despite efforts by rescuers who pulled the victims from the water and administered emergency aid on the shore. The woman's husband, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON>, and the boy's mother, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacheco </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, were comforted by friends at the scene. The victims were among a group of six who were walking through the rapids `` when the water came and took us,'' said <PERSON> Esperanca </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON>, 10, a cousin of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>'s niece. <PERSON> Esperanca </PERSON>'s brother, sister and another cousin also were in the group, she said, but all survivors escaped injuries. One child was hanging piggy-back on Mrs. <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> as the group struggled to shore, <PERSON> Esperanca </PERSON> said. She said <PERSON> Lizandro </PERSON> could not swim and had to be pulled from a public swimming pool earlier this year. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougher </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> policeman, said he was nearby when children came running from the wooded bank crying for help. He ran down to the river and saw Mrs. <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> floating face down near the shore. <PERSON> Dougher </PERSON> said he pulled her ashore and gave her mouth-to-mouth and cardiopulmonary resuscitation but `` I could n't get any vitals.'' Other rescuers arrived and tried to resuscitate the woman while two police officers tied to ropes searched for the boy in the 5-to-6-foot deep water. Two fishermen in a boat downstream found the boy in about 6 to 8 feet of water. The victims were taken to two different hospitals, where they were pronounced dead.

However, he walked without assistance and spoke in a firm voice. `` Today, on the day to honor the war dead and pray for peace, I think of those who died in battle in the last war and their bereaved families, and it still hurts my heart,'' he said. `` Time flies fast, and in the 43 years since the end of the war, the country has developed due to people's efforts,'' he said.

 A riot at the overcrowded 144-year-old jail here left eight people injured and much of the institution destroyed, while three prisoners escaped during a revolt at a prison 15 miles away, authorities said. Two of the escapees were at large today. Inmates at the <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION>, aggravated by Sunday's heat and upset about overcrowding and food quality, twice set fire to the granite jail. The second blaze destroyed an entire wing containing 36 cells, about a quarter of the prison. About 500 people, many relatives and friends of inmates, watched the disturbances. `` They chanted ` Feed us!' ` Give us food'!'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 45, who had come to visit her inmate husband. `` The conditions in there are deplorable. It stinks.'' Nearly 200 of the 250 inmates were relocated to other prisons around the state, said jail Superintendent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mageary </PERSON>. Late Sunday, inmates at the <ORGANIZATION> Billerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> set fire to a work shed and three inmates escaped after a scuffle with a guard. One was recaptured quickly. Three inmates and at least two guards sustained minor injuries, said <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McGonigle </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Billerica </LOCATION> was one of the prisons where inmates from <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> were to be transfered, but those plans were dropped because of the disturbance there. In <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, a group of inmates set the first fire at about noon on a wooden floor in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION>. The more serious fire broke out in the same wing about an hour later and raged for 1 -LCB- hours. Prisoners pelted firefighters and police with debris as flames poured through the roof during the three-hour uprising. No escapes were reported, but two inmates were caught attempting to slip out, said <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON>. `` Cops got hit, firefighters got hit,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> fire Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` They threw pipes _ long pipes, I do n't know where they got them from _ bricks, bottles.'' When it was over, at least eight people, including five inmates, were treated at hospitals for minor injuries or smoke inhalation, officials said. The melee drew about 150 state and local police and riot squads, plus 100 firefighters. The immediate cause of the uprising was n't known, <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said. But he said the prison was filled to twice its capacity of 127 prisoners. The Lawrence house of correction holds inmates convicted of misdemeanors with maximum terms of up to 2 -LCB- years, officials said. It also serves as a jail for persons awaiting trial. State correction Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fair </PERSON> said the fire `` certainly puts a tremendous strain on an already overcrowded system.'' However, plans already were under way for a new <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Middleton </LOCATION> to replace the Lawrence prison, according to state <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. The prison, in the design stage, is expected to cost $ 30 million to $ 40 million. Fair said it would be difficult to find room in the state system to relocate the scores of prisoners displaced by the Lawrence fire. `` I do n't have any room,'' Fair said. `` This is a major loss.''

 More than 1,200 refugees were allowed to return home from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church workers accompanying them agreed to stay behind, ending a daylong impasse, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> official said. The government, which claims many refugees living in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> back leftist Salvadoran guerrillas, had accused the church workers of exploiting the returning refugees for political ends. The refugees and more than 150 vehicles, held on the Honduran side of the border since Saturday night, were allowed to cross the border Sunday evening, said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees. The church workers `` were conscious that by not coming they would create no type of problems'' for the returning Salvadorans, he said by telephone. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said the refugees from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s nearly 9-year-old civil war were on their way to hometowns in northern <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> province, which they left in the early 1980s. In the Honduran capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, a foreign ministry spokesman said the refugees were being escorted by officials from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency. There was no immediate comment from the government and the church workers could not be reached. The Salvadorans lived in the <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> refugee camp 30 miles north of the border before leaving under an arrangement between the refugees, the Salvadoran government and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> group, which is overseeing the repatriation. Their convoy of 36 buses and 116 trucks was halted in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> about 500 yards from the border late Saturday. Salvadoran authorities refused to permit 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church workers of the Going Home organization to accompany them. Interior Minister <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Belloso </PERSON> <PERSON> Funes </PERSON> told reporters at the border Sunday his government `` welcomes with open arms'' the refugees. `` But the so-called internationalists among them are using our brothers for strictly political ends. They -LRB- the foreigners -RRB- are coming here to break our laws, and I have orders from the highest level that they not be permitted entry,'' he said. <PERSON> Amadeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a returning refugee and member of the community's directorate, said earlier Sunday that the group of 1,230 refugees was insisting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church workers be allowed to enter <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendiluce </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> group's Central American director, said the presence of the church workers was not contemplated in the accord. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitale </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and spokesman for the Going Home delegation, blamed the government for the standoff. `` This is part of the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> government's continuing efforts to obstruct the refugees' return,'' he said, adding that all members of his delegation had visas for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Going Home is an interfaith organization supporting Salvadoran refugees. The armed forces consider the three Salvadoran refugee camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> part of the rear guard of leftist guerrillas that have fought the U.S.-supported government. About 4,300 refugees returned last year and about 15,000 Salvadoran refugees remain in the camps. The majority of the 65,000 people killed in the war have been civilians. Human rights groups blame security forces and rightist death squads for most of the political murders in the early 1980s. Such killings dropped off dramatically after 1983.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> says witnesses tell it Burmese troops have killed and tortured rice farmers and other Shan tribespeople in suppressing an insurgency among <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s largest ethnic minority The report by the London-based group, received in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> today, was the second documentation that <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> says shows `` a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights'' by the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> military in trying to suppress minorities fighting for autonomy. In recent days, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> and other private foreign organizations have also expressed concern over mass arrests and killings of anti-government demonstrators in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and other parts of the country. The protestors, most from the <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> majority group, are demanding a restoration of democracy after 26 years of authoritarian rule. The latest, 25-page report said <PERSON> Shans </PERSON> interviewed by <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> described 46 alleged extrajudicial executions and 58 alleged cases of `` torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment'' in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s Shan State The information gathered, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> said, also implicated soldiers of 10 Burmese infantry units as well as intelligence and police personnel. Most of the victims were said to be ordinary villagers suspected of cooperating with various insurgent groups. They ranged from a 43-year-old villager bayoneted to death on suspicion of aiding the insurgents to four men impressed as porters for the army who had their skulls crushed by rifle butts for failing to to keep up with a moving troop column. In May, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> released a 71-page report detailing nearly 200 victims among the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kachin </LOCATION> and Mon ethnic minority groups among whom insurgency has also been rife for several decades. Amnesty said the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> government apparently has not carried out any of the steps the organization suggested in May to prevent human rights abuses. `` The information available to <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> remains limited by the unwillingness of the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government to grant independent human rights investigators access to the country,'' the report says. The Shans and others interviewed sought refuge in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The Shans, who number some 4.2 million out of the country's 38 million people, began armed opposition to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in the late 1950s, operating in the rugged hills of eastern <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Some of the insurgent groups are described as mere traffickers in opium, which is grown in great quantity in <ORGANIZATION> Shan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, but the tribespeople also have a long tradition of seeking cultural and political independence from the more powerful Burmans. A number of sources in recent years have reported that the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> army has forced thousands of villagers into service as porters for troops battling the Shans and other rebels. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON>, an American author of several books on <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, said recently that about 13,000 peasants were recruited as porters for a major offensive against <LOCATION> Kachin </LOCATION> insurgents last year. `` They were forced to walk ahead of troops in order to test for mines; they were forced to carry munitions and supplies and, if they refused or fell, they were beaten and often killed,'' the professor at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said. Amnesty cited several examples of alleged brutal mistreatment and killing of porters including a 30-year-old villager who fell while climbing up a steep slope and was stabbed to death in the back by an enlisted man. `` The captain did n't reprimand the corporal who killed him. The captain said it was a good thing because ... now there was one fewer of the -LRB- Shan -RRB- bastards,'' another porter who said he saw the killing told Amnesty. Despite similar reports emerging from isolationist, non-aligned <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in recent years there has been little protest from governments around the world and only few official comments about the recent use of armed force against civilian demonstrators. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week said it deplored the shooting of unarmed demonstrators and urged that `` non-lethal means should be employed to deal with such demonstrations.'' Five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators introduced a resolution condemning the suppression of protest. There has been no known reaction to the alleged human rights abuses by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the two major aid and loan donors to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. American officials say privately the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has normally refrained from sharp criticism of the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> government for fear of jeopardizing its anti-narcotics program in the country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has supplied aircraft and chemicals which the Burmese use to destroy opium fields by aerial spraying.

 A high-tech toilet seat that lowers automatically and a speaking smoke detector that gives warnings in English or Spanish are among the 250,000 products being displayed at the National Hardware Show. With a push of the button, the seat can automatically move up or down. It also can remove odors with its fanning mechanism and charcoal filter, adjust its temperature to suit any posterior and can kill germs with an ultraviolet light. While the seat does eliminate some age-old conflicts between men and women, there is a catch. It retails for $ 350. `` The price is too high,'' acknowledged <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiu </PERSON>, who developed the device and is director of <ORGANIZATION> Eletto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` Most people wo n't pay $ 350 for what this can do. At that price, I doubt if I'd buy it myself.'' The four-day show, which began Sunday, is the biggest in its 43-year history and the country's largest trade show, said manager <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolson </PERSON>. About 70,000 retailers are expected to attend. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schaumburg </ORGANIZATION>, said do-it-yourselfers are fueling the industry. They spent $ 52 billion last year at hardware, home center and building supply outlets, and the market is expected to grow by 12 percent annually, to total $ 100 billion by 1990, he said. `` Do-it-yourself people are moving the home improvement industry outdoors,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Dolson </PERSON>. `` It's a recreational thing for the yuppie generation and we see tremendous growth in this area.'' One prominent item for the outdoors do-it-yourselfer is a new version of an old standby: the push lawnmower. American Lawn Mowers, a family-owned company based in <LOCATION> Shelbyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, is displaying its line of cast-iron push mowers retailing for $ 69 to $ 99, which it says are ideal for the small patch of grass around the condo patio. `` It's the lawnmower for the lifestyle of the new generation,'' said <PERSON> Teri </PERSON> <PERSON> McClain </PERSON>, a company sales representative. `` Joggers and people into aerobics can get a workout mowing the lawn.'' Ms. <PERSON> McClain </PERSON> said sales of the push mower are up 47 percent during the past two years, after a lightweight 17-pound model of the 50-year-old traditional design was introduced several years ago. For the non-athletically inclined, the show offered a top-of-the-line <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> lawnmower, a $ 5,000 riding vehicle with four-wheel steering from Swedish maker <ORGANIZATION> Husqvarna </ORGANIZATION>. And then there's Vocalert, a computerized smoke detector that not only sounds an alarm signal but can offer instructions in a calm, authoritative voice. It has a built-in bilingual English-Spanish vocabulary of 100 words and phrases _ that can be programmed to tell people what to do to escape _ such as `` stay calm'' or `` drop to the floor,'' depending on the intensity of the fire, which its sensors pick up. `` It has an intelligence to it and is good for situations in which people are disoriented like children and the elderly,'' said its inventor, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sansonetti </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sansonetti </PERSON> said about 1.2 million are being produced, with the suggested retail price $ 89.95 He said it should be available in store by mid-fall. `` It's going to eliminate the confusion for everyone,'' he said.

 Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> today, hospital officials said, and the army confined 650,000 Arabs to their <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> homes after three days of violence. Soldiers sealed off the entire <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> with an indefinite curfew, barring visitors and journalists for the third time since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8. The move followed clashes in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> on Sunday in which the army said its soldiers shot and wounded 12 Palestinians. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports put the figure at 25 wounded. Also Sunday, a firebomb hurled at a car traveling to a Jewish settlement injured six Israelis, including an 8-month-old burned on the face and arms. Witnesses said soldiers went door-to-door in some areas of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, ordering residents to go out and paint over slogans on walls, take down <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and clean up debris from demonstrations. Some slogans said: `` Strike and Confrontation,'' `` We Will Never Kneel Before the Zionists'' and `` Deportations and Arrests Will Never Scare Us.'' Journalists were stopped by soldiers at the <LOCATION> Erez </LOCATION> checkpoint leading into the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Army officers said knots of protesters set burning tires along the road from the checkpoint to <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. As a result of the curfew, the 50,000 Arab workers from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were unable to go to their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Arab reporters and hospital officials said <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON>, 21, was shot through the heart today after nightlong demonstrations at the <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, where youths set up roadblocks and burned tires. His death brought to 244 the number of Palestinians killed in the 8-month-old uprising against 21 years of Israeli occupaiton. Four Israelis have also died. Palestinians attributed the outbreak in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> to the burning deaths of two Arab workers near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Police said Jewish extremists may have torched a hut where three Arab builders slept near a construction site. No one has been arrested. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, speaking on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, attributed the sudden upsurge of violence to a show of strength by Moslem fundamentalists who had called for demonstrations to mark the start of the new Islamic year 1409. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said Israeli authorities adopted a new stategy to choke off the violence, uprooting village and neighborhood Palestinian committees which have sought to run community affairs and coordinate anti-Israeli activities. He also said the army had been ordered to `` shoot to hit'' firebomb-throwers and `` if one is caught, to demolish his home without granting him right of apppeal.'' Palestinian leaders protested the Israeli clampdown that confined the entire <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> population to their homes as an attempt to `` terrorize'' civilians. `` What the Israelis are doing is really inhuman, and they keep doing it despite all the protests from all over the world. It seems that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> translates the protests into a ` Keep going' message,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Hayder </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Jewish settlers called on the government to take tougher measures after the firebomb attack, in which four Israeli children and two adults were burned while en route to the <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dekalim </PERSON> settlement. `` The army met with us and conveyed they would take a series of severe decisions ... uprooting orchards, destroying houses, deporting whoever did it,'' said <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Beit-Halachmi </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Jewish settlement movement in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` With that report, we were able to ask our people not to go out to the area themselves,'' he said, referring to the settlers' threat to take vigilante action Israeli officials, meanwhile, gave a mixed reacton to statements by <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s Fatah faction. He told the weekly <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dimanche </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was considering forming a provisional government that would drop its demand for the elimination of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said officials would `` study attentively'' the text of the interview which officials expected to receive later in the day. Privately, sources close to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s liberal foreign minister, <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, said they welcomed the debate among Palestinians. `` It's a positive thing when people talk politics instead of war,'' said a source who demanded anonymity. However, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimier </PERSON>, a spokesman for right-wing Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, noted the firebomb attack on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and said `` we have to watch what they do not what they say.'' He said <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>'s proposal was a tactical move and was not based on a sincere desire for coexistence.

 Wanted: A new king of the wild frontier. Being born on a mountaintop in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> helpful, but not required. <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> are bringing back <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> and held an open casting call Sunday to expand the search for an actor to fill the role played on television by <PERSON> Fess </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> in the 1950s. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Blinn </PERSON>, the executive producer of the show that will be part of `` The Magical World of Disney,'' said the search has gone on for more than five months and has auditioned more than 800 people. `` It's a quality of strength and intelligence and a kind of implied humor that Fess always brought to it, and a kind of droll warmth. That's hard to find,'' <ORGANIZATION> Blinn </ORGANIZATION> said. The producer said he was n't interested in a `` Rambo'' sort of hero or the muscle-bound characters played by <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON>. `` They do n't offer humor in their portrayal, nor do they offer to me a guy that is at ease with himself _ they have a great deal of tension,'' <ORGANIZATION> Blinn </ORGANIZATION> said. The series, scheduled to premiere in November, is based on the life of <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, a frontiersman who fought river pirates and Indians and served in the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in the 1820s and 1830s. The old show's theme song identified <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> as the frontier king who was born on a mountaintop in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBay </PERSON>, one of the more than 75 actors at the casting call, said he had a coonskin cap and watched reruns of the series as a child. `` It was important when you played cowboys and Indians to know who <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> was,'' the 25-year-old said. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, 27, said he shares a love of the outdoors with <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> and believes it is important to have old-fashioned heroes like <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>. `` I think our children deserve better than Rambo,'' he said. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> will appear in the first two-hour episode as an elder statesman reflecting on his youth. The new `` <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>'' will be rotated on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly `` The Magical World Of Disney'' with other features, including cartoons and a re-creation of `` The Absent-Minded Professor'' with <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in the title role.

 Sad-eyed, white-whiskered <PERSON> Olga </PERSON>, the nation's oldest walrus in captivity, has died. The 27-year-old <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> walrus died of old age Sunday, said veterinarian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Torgerson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Olga </PERSON>, who weighed about 2,700 pounds, had been at the <LOCATION> Brookfield </LOCATION> Zoo outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> since 1962, when she was a 6-month old pup. `` She was quite a character,'' said zoo spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> gained national attention in 1979 when zoo officials were seeking `` zoo parents'' to help underwrite costs. At that time, the tab for <PERSON> Olga </PERSON>'s fresh-frozen mackerel and herring diet _ 60 pounds a day _ was $ 13,000 a year. More than $ 20,000 in contributions came in from some 1,000 `` parents'' across the nation. `` We used to celebrate her birthday each year with her adoptive parents and <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> was one for shows,'' Ms. <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> said. `` She'd whistle, blow kisses, wave her flippers and spray the crowd when nobody expected it She was just a real joy.'' <PERSON> Olga </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> Brookfield </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> Zoo in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, began suffering kidney problems late last month.

<TEXT>
 A government-run newspaper says <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will do all it can to secure the freedom of British hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but is requesting in return that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> help find Iranians missing there. The word came in a Sunday editorial in the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and coincided with a visit by British diplomat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>, who said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials told him he will be able to meet this week with an Englishman being held on spying charges. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a senior aide to <ORGANIZATION> Archbishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said today he is cautious about a quick release of hostages following talks with an Iranian diplomat in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Times editorial said: `` Undoubtedly the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will spare no effort to press ahead with the release of British hostages, particularly <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>,'' referring to <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s envoy. `` Yet what <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> legitimately expects of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is to provide <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with all the information possible about the fate of four Iranian hostages'' believed held by <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> militia `` under the influence of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' it added. Four Iranians disappeared in a Christian-controlled area of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982. No group ever claimed to hold them and some reports have said they were killed. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and two other Britons are among 18 foreigners believed held by groups affiliated with the pro-Iranian and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The 18 include nine Americans. The editorial also follows talks in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last week between <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, spiritual leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamedi </PERSON>, an Iranian Foreign Ministry official. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyttle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s senior assistant, said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today that whether <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> chooses to pressure for the release of the British captives remains to be seen. `` I do n't think this is the time to talk about either assurances or promises,'' <PERSON> Lyttle </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio interview. `` I'm optimistic that he -LRB- <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> -RRB- is alive and that the other British hostages are alive. As to whether anything is going to happen quickly, I'm rather more cautious,'' he said. <PERSON> Lyttle </PERSON> said he and the archbishop made clear to <PERSON> Mohamedi </PERSON> that the church has a limited role as far as the hostages are concerned. `` We want to make it quite plain that the church can not be an alternative diplomatic channel, but that its interest is a humanitarian one and a rather particular one. We may be able to oil a wheel here and there, but we certainly ca n't act as an alternative diplomatic channel,'' he said. <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> said he met with <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials twice on Sunday and they told him he would be able to meet jailed Englishman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> this week. He gave no other details. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 52, a nephew of the late British poet and novelist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, was arrested in December 1985 and has been held in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s Evin Prison. Before leaving <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Friday, <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> said he would speak with officials about the foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In July, an Anglican bishop went to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to initiate inquiries among Christians about the fate of the four Iranians missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been making conciliatory statements about relations with Western nations since it announced July 18 it was accepting a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> call for a cease-fire in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. The cease-fire is scheduled to take hold Saturday. Last summer, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> withdrew all its diplomats from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and virtually severed ties after a British diplomat was detained and beaten in apparent reprisal for British police arresting an Iranian envoy on shoplifting charges. One Iranian diplomat remains in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> disappeared in January 1987 while trying to secure the release of American hostages. The other two British citizens believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, kidnapped on April 17, 1986 and university professor <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, kidnapped April 11, 1986. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> also holds an Irish passport. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> says it also seeks word on <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim they killed him. His body was never found. The foreigner held longest is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was abducted March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Police Dogs Taught To Bark Before Biting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The police department is training police dogs to bark instead of bite _ but a civil rights activist says many people will never forget the news images of protesters being mauled in the 1960s. `` Unfortunately, the 25-year-old image of police dogs -LRB- in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> -RRB- still lives,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Sgt. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> said the program is part of the department's minimal-force arrest policy, under which a suspect will be given every chance to surrender peacefully `` A felon breaking into a business deserves to be off the street, but he does not need to be dog-bitten,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON>, who directs the canine unit. Guy said the policy is a move to boost professionalism in the department. During civil rights protests in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> in the 1960s, newsmen filmed snarling police dogs biting protesters. Those films have been shown frequently since then. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said he has been invited to watch the department demonstrate its new policy. The dogs are being trained to sprint toward the suspect and, instead of sinking their teeth into the suspect's arm, veer off at the last moment, blocking any escape attempt, while barking loudly and baring their teeth. Guy said the dog will bite if a suspect tries to attack the accompanying officer or the animal.

 People who were n't too chicken to crow like roosters or cackle like hens held the spotlight at the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION>, along with wives calling their husbands and men their calling hogs. For as much as $ 75 in prize money, contestants could imitate roosters and hens, or be the best at calling their husbands or hogs. `` I figured for $ 75 I could make a fool of myself,'' says <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartz </PERSON>, winner of Saturday's rooster crowing contest. He donned a white hood complete with red comb before crouching down to scurry around in front of a crowd of people and crow like a rooster. He was n't the only one of the 15 contestants in the fair's first rooster crowing and hen cackling contests who was in it for the money. `` Cold, hard cash,'' was how <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordike </PERSON> of <PERSON> Carlyle </PERSON> described his motivation for entering the contest. <PERSON> Nordike </PERSON> won a $ 10, third-place prize for his rooster imitation, which included some amorous advances toward a woman who was supposed to be a hen. The winners in the husband and hog calling contests said they were n't in it for the money. `` I enjoy it and I love pigs,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Routzong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Springboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who was named Grand Champion Hog Caller for a third consecutive year on Sunday. The factory supervisor's routine combines realism with whimsy as he enters the arena, dumps some corn from a bucket and begins hitting the bucket with an ear of corn. That `` is how you really call a pig,'' he said. Then <PERSON> Routzong </PERSON> hit the highlight of his performance with a chorus of `` Pig-o-lo, pig-o-lo, pig-o-lo, pig,'' in an operatic baritone. The Grand Champion Husband Caller was also a three-time winner. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chillicothe </LOCATION> won the prize by dressing like a hag and reading an instruction manual on how to call a husband. `` When it comes time to yell do n't be shy, just open your mouth and let her fly,'' she screamed as she read from the manual. And she did. `` Donnnnnnnald,'' rang from the rafters in the Swine Barn. And out scurried <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s husband, who ran up and gave her a kiss. He wore a `` husband'' sign around his neck so spectators would know who he was. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said he was n't embarrassed by all the attention. `` Something to do on a Sunday afternoon,'' he said.

<HEAD>Coroner Changes Policy To Aid Police Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Unidentified women slain in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> no longer will be cremated in order to preserve evidence for police investigating links between a serial killing spree here and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> slayings. County coroner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> also said his office will perform more extensive tests on the bodies of unidentified women that may be linked to the deaths of at least 10 other women in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> since 1985. The policy was prompted by criticism last week from homicide detectives. Detectives from both states have been studying similarities between the two murder cases for at least 18 months but said no conclusive link has been made. One body was cremated before being linked to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said. `` We will change our procedure,'' <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said. `` When the circumstances of a death clearly indicate that a homicide situation has occurred _ even though we ca n't establish a cause of death _ in the future we will request that the person will be buried.'' In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, unidentified bodies normally are cremated after three months. In <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> investigation is based, unidentified remains are held in an office or buried after extensive body X-rays. Unidentified remains that are buried or stored can be exhumed later for future examination. The <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> case has been described as the nation's worst unsolved serial murder case. The remains of 40 young women have been found around <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and eight missing young women are thought to have been slain by the killer, who mostly preyed on women linked to prostitution or other street life. The last slaying linked with the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killer occurred in 1984. Since June 1985, 30 slain women have been found near freeways in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Authorities say between 10 and 18 are the work of the same killer.

<HEAD>Navy Probe Finds Intelligence Messages Lost</HEAD>

 More than 150 secret <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> documents, including decoding materials and details of sensitive electronic-warfare equipment, were lost by engineers and officers at an installation here, a newspaper reported. No evidence was found that the documents were sold to or obtained by hostile agents, but it `` can not be discounted that the unaccounted-for secret material may have been subjected to compromise,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials declined comment because the report is under review, the newspaper reported Sunday. In March, then-acting <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> blamed the lost documents on poor bookkeeping and lax supervision. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators discovered that 158 documents were missing after an audit of recordkeeping last year at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> 19, the report said. Among the missing materials were manuals on Sea Nymph submarine sensors designed to pick up enemy radar and conversations and data about anti-missile early-warning devices, the newspaper said. Also unaccounted for were `` key cards,'' or cryptography keys to encoding and decoding military communications. The missing documents were from 1979 through 1984. The report strongly criticized Capt. <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, commander of the center during much of that time, but recommended no discipline against him. He retired in 1986. However, disciplinary action is pending against <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassett </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Chula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION>, a civil servant who was supervisor of the classified mailroom vault at the command from 1981 until 1987, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Hassett </PERSON> said he noticed documents were missing but added, `` I did n't think there was anything clandestine, just poor accounting of the publications by the various departments.'' The report called for a new computer system for tracking classified documents. The system already has been implemented, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, intentionally staying behind as the opening spotlight plays on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said today that `` pressure is mounting'' on him as time grows short before his Thursday night acceptance speech as the Republican presidential nominee. However, the vice president indicated he felt no pressure to reveal the one big secret of the party's convention _ the name of his running mate. Making the rounds of the morning network interview shows, he said he was still `` getting it clear in my mind'' and reiterated his vow to tell no one his choice in advance after he does decide. Campaign aides insist that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will withhold the announcement until Thursday morning _ partly to build suspense and coax a larger television audience for the Thursday night speech. He said there are still multiple contenders for the No. 2 spot. `` I have not decided. And I probably will say when I have decided,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' On `` CBS This Morning,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I have not told a soul what I'm thinking and I literally mean that _ not <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> -LRB- his new campaign chairman -RRB-, not <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Nobody.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show that once he does make up his mind, `` I think my choice will be widely accepted'' at the convention. He said that he feels pressure as the night of his speech nears _ a night that both <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic leaders say will be important for the fall campaign _ but he also said, `` I'm an athlete'' and can handle pressure. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was working on his acceptance speech again today. He arrives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Tuesday. Asked if he was concerned that people would compare him with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said such comparisons were inevitable. But, he told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` I've got to be what I am and I'm not going to try to be somebody else.'' He called the convention `` a big moment for me, the culmination of a lot of years of politics.'' He told CBS that he planned to have his entire family with him at the convention. `` Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did a good job on that -LRB- showing off his family -RRB- at the Democratic convention. But we've got a stronger bench. And we've got a great family.'' Spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said Sunday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already had been through three drafts of the speech, written with speechwriter <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON>, and had practiced it Sunday afternoon at his official vice presidential residence with media consultant <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also had lunch Sunday with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Aides said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still hopes to delay a final announcement of his vice presidential choice until Thursday morning. However, one source said aides are considering whether to unveil the choice Wednesday night. Names being most frequently mentioned are <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and his wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>; Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>; Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>; Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>; and Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Many of the would-be candidates made the rounds of television talk shows Sunday. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' disclosed he had asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to remove his name from the list. `` I would be a liability for <PERSON> George </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said, citing his support for limiting Social Security benefit increases and his belief that the next president will have to increase taxes to trim the federal deficit as among the positions he had taken that would `` fail the litmus test.'' However, a top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign official, who insisted upon anonymity, said on Sunday that <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> was sending `` mixed signals'' and that his comments were not necessarily an indication that he would be dropped from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s short list. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in making his final selection, is not necessarily limiting himself to those whose names have been frequently mentioned, the official said. In a separate appearance on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, at 41 the youngest of those believed to be under consideration, said, `` I would like to believe that I would be acceptable to the whole party.'' And <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> declared, `` I am not running for vice president.'' Then, referring to his wife, he added: `` I'm not campaigning for anyone, but she would be a great addition to the ticket.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, meanwhile, said it was `` very flattering'' to be mentioned but `` I have a job to do for this president.'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said on `` Meet the Press'' that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> would `` make a good attorney general'' but quickly added, `` I did n't say for how long,'' suggesting his remarks should n't be interpreted to suggest <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was no longer under consideration. Meanwhile, the vice president, not generally known for his prowess as a public speaker, continued to focus attention on his acceptance speech. In addition to his practice in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, time has been set aside in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for a rehearsal in the Superdome, aides said.

<TEXT>
 Charging riot police today broke up radical students who tried to march to the North Korean border for reunification talks and troopers brutally beat and kicked protesters. Waves of troopers in green combat fatigues and black visored helmets charged the students as they tried to march out of <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in western <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Police armored vans also fired salvos of tear gas bombs into the screaming students. `` Unite the fatherland'' and `` Yankee go home,'' students yelled. Police dragged away about 200 students, some of them screaming with fear and pain. The unresisting students huddled in groups on the ground, clinging to each other as troopers beat them with fists and even riot shields. Senior police officers hit and slapped their own men to try to stop the beatings. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, in a speech today to mark Independence Day, called radical students a threat to next month's Summer Olympics and said disorder would not be tolerated. `` The people and the government will not forgive anyone who spoils the -LRB- Olympic -RRB- festival through mob action or the throwing of firebombs,'' he said. The students tried to march out of the college three times, but were beaten back by police. Marchers did not try to fight back, except when police pushed deep into the campus and students attacked them with clubs and rocks. They apparently decided not to resist initially and let themselves be arrested, departing from their normal tactic of being first to start violence. Some said they volunteered to be arrested. About 3,000 students had assembled on the campus to try to march 35 miles north to the border truce site of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> for talks with North Korean student delegates on reuniting the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. The government banned the march and deployed 25,000 riot police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to stop it. The North Korean students waited for two hours in Panmonjum today but left when the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> students failed to arrive, according to a report by the <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. It was monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The South Korean radical students, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have virtually no public support and protests last week attracted just a few thousand people. Still, Koreans fear that violent protests by the radicals could cast a shadow over the Olympics. After the march was blocked, students regrouped on the campus and surged out with firebombs and rocks to battle the 7,000 riot police around the school. Police vans blasted tear gas bombs and both sides pelted each other with rocks. Police had few problems containing the students. Students were unable to get past troopers surrounding the university. Hundreds of students tried to stage protests in other parts of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> or get to train stations to reach the border. But riot police quickly broke up protests and seized scores of radicals. Roads leading to the border were also blocked by riot police. A similar attempt to march to <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> on June 10 was blocked by police, and the turnout for today's march appeared considerably smaller. Student leaders told a rally before trying to march out of <LOCATION> Yonsei </LOCATION> that the radicals would not stop trying to oust the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government and reunite the two Koreas. Dozens of students cut their fingers with razors and wrote slogans in blood. `` We will never give up until we have destroyed the military dictatorship and reunited our nation,'' one leader said. The radicals also denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, saying <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supports military rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. They demanded the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based here under a treaty. Two American leftists, <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheiner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, told the rally they brought messages of support from radicals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They told the students millions of Americans support their struggle and want <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> called for greater efforts to ease tension between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He proposed reunification talks with North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>. Similar proposals in the past have not led to talks, but the two Koreas are considering parliamentary talks on easing tension. A first meeting may be held at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> on Friday. Radical students have seized on the reunification issue to try to mobilize public support for their anti-government campaign. The students say they are not communists, but insist that the peninsula must be reunited immediately with political differences to be worked out later. Most South Koreans fear the North is determined to conquer them. The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean War, which ended three years later without a political solution.

<HEAD>Government Abolishes State Tourism Organization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government announced today it will abolish the state tourism agency and said major hotels, restaurants and other facilities will be sold or leased to the private sector. The Revolution Command Council, which passed the decree Aug. 2, said state-run assets to be privatized included seven hotels in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, as well as properties in the war-battered southern port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and the northern city of <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION>. Hotels not sold will be leased for 25 years to private companies, the council said. The <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> Sheraton Hotel was damaged by shell and rocket fire during a Iranian offensive in early 1987, when some of the heaviest fighting in the 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war took place. The state-owned facilities also include a tourist complex in <LOCATION> Habaniya </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, and several modern resorts in the northern mountains, the scene of heavy fighting in the war. The managers of the hotels said they did not know if the facilities will be sold to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s private sector or to their parent companies. Officials said the hotels are to be run by their parent chains in accordance with an agreement signed with the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government. Tourism in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which is rich in archaeological sites, has diminished as a result of the conflict, but no statistics were available. The move to sell the facilities is part of President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s drive to stimulate the economy. The announcement came as Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leaders prepared to meet in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Aug. 25 for peace talks under a United Nations-mediated cease-fire.

 A heat wave that set records from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> was blamed for a riot that injured eight at a sweltering <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> jail, and utility officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> warned of blackouts today unless users conserve. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 35 Salvadoran aliens spent five hours Sunday locked inside a broiling boxcar with almost no ventilation and probably would have died had they not been discovered, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Border Patrol officials said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a carriage horse collapsed from the heat on a main thoroughfare but got up the strenth to move on after being hosed down. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Runners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, spurred by the heatstroke deaths of two joggers during the past five weeks, took down the clock for a Central Park race so runners would n't be tempted to push themselves. No problems were reported. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the temperature jumped from 78 to 92 degrees in 10 minutes. Sunday was the fifth consecutive day of record heat for <PERSON> Beckley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> W.V. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> had the nation's high at 113, it was 89 after midnight. <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> exeeded 90 for the 34th day this year, breaking the 33-day record of 1955. Madison recorded 95 degrees, a record for the date in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s capital. Temperatures topped 90 for the 17th straight day in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> tied a 1944 record of 98 Sunday, the 40th day of 90-degree temperatures this summer. That equals the record for the most 90-degree days in one year. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where the high was 97 degrees, Sunday was the 31st day this summer that temperatures have peaked above 90. The record is 37 days. `` The heat's gon na kill people,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morena </PERSON>, a palm reader and spirtual adviser. `` People are too nervous, too cranky, too hot. It's very bad for your sex life.'' Inmates aggravated by the heat, overcrowding and the food twice set fire to a 144-year-old granite jail in <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. One blaze at the jail, which has no air conditioning, destroyed a wing containing 36 cells, about a quarter of the jail. Nearly 200 of the 250 inmates were relocated to other prisons around the state, said jail Superintendent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mageary </PERSON>. As New Yorkers returned from weekend activities and cranked up the air conditioning, power demand hit a record for a Sunday, according to <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>. New <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> power officials warned Sunday night that blackouts could occur throughout the six-state region today unless users conserved electricity. A shutdown this weekend of the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yankee </LOCATION> nuclear power plant and one of four generators on <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has made things worse. `` If we do n't get a considerable contribution by our customers, as we did a number of days last week, we may not be able to provide uninterrupted service,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheperdson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pool </ORGANIZATION>, which serves <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Die-hards who thought they could live without mechanically cooled air begged for mercy from air conditioner salesmen who long since had sold out their stock. `` It's not really for me, it's for my piano,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Tritle </PERSON>, a customer in Uncle <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>'s electronics store. <PERSON> Tritle </PERSON> said he was a musician whose $ 7,200 Steinway could n't take it anymore. `` The piano is screaming for relief. The keys stick, the response is all mucked up, the music is slow.'' Salesman <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said he'd sold everything, including demos and displays. Entomologists in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area said the mosquito population had surged to four times its normal level because of too little rain in June, too much rain in July and high humidity in August. The 35 aliens found in <LOCATION> Kingsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, were being held Sunday night, <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` It was well over 100 degrees -LRB- outside -RRB- when we found them,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` It was probably another 20 to 30 degrees hotter inside the car.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, aware of the warm images of hearth and home evoked by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last month, promised today to show <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` exactly how much my great, strong, big family means to me.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has four sons and a daughter, concedes <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did a good job at the Democratic National Convention with his speech and `` showing those wonderfully warm pictures'' of his family. Now the vice president said, it is his turn. `` You know, on family ... I've always tried to hold that a little bit close,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` And yet, I think I have to share now with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people exactly how much my great, strong, big family means to me.'' Earlier, the vice president said the Bushes `` come out of a little more conservative tradition. We have n't been able to speak as glowingly and as warmly, not because we did n't believe, because it was different somehow.'' <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sons, said today on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>: `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has nothing on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when it comes to real family.'' In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' voice caught as he talked about his deceased father. And there were warm words for his mother <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON>, an introduction from his cousin <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> and fond embraces between the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and his wife. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s children _ all of whom are delegates _ are making the rounds in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, talking to other delegates, attending receptions, working behind the scenes, generally stoking the fires for Dad. Grandson <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will lead the Pledge of Allegiance on Tuesday. Son <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will address the convention on Wednesday night and on Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wife of 43 years, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, will speak. All told, there will be more than 60 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> relatives here. After a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> clan dinner Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s eldest son <PERSON> George </PERSON> _ a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> delegate and a top strategist in his father's campaign _ will announce the delegation's 111 votes that will put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> oer the top. `` To have his son of the same name put him over the top speaks about family and the commitment of our family to work hard for the person we love,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in an interview. Issues such as day care, health care for the elderly, parental leave and other family-related concerns have become important in the 1988 campaign, and the Republicans do n't intend to concede that ground to the Democrats. Great pains will be taken to portray the nominee as a family man. Much of that testimony will come from his children, all actively involved in the campaign and some of them expert campaigners in their own right. `` Up to now, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been reluctant to talk about his family, his religion, things of a personal nature,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says. `` Obviously the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are demanding more than just issues. Part of the convention will be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opening up, his family speaking out about love.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 42, admits to being a seasoned politician. He ran for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> unsuccessfully and now is a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign strategist. <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 35, is secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and worked in his father's 1980 presidential campaign. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 33, lives in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and worked on his brother <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s congressional campaign and on the 1980 presidential campaign. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 31, has his own investment consulting firm in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlond </PERSON> will turn 29 on the day her father accepts his party's nomination for president Described as an `` aggressive'' campaigner, she currently lives in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. The vice president's two brothers, <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>, and sister, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, will be in attendance this week, as will an assortment of cousins, nieces, nephews and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 10 grandchildren. His immediate family will surround <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he accepts the nomination. `` I have goose bumps,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first cousin who is also a delegate. `` A lot of us have been working for this for a long time.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says the family display at the convention, choreographed though it may be, wo n't be `` put on.'' `` It'll be a very sincere expression of love,'' he says. But as for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, convention-viewers should not expect to see the kind of embraces or affectionate moments the Dukakises are fond of _ once they were spotted dancing at an airport in the absence of music. The Bushes are n't given to that type of display and seem to be a bit touchy about the subject. `` I'm not going to dance with her ... with no music. I'm not going to go that far,'' the vice president said. `` I do n't like to dance anyway, and she knows I'm lousy at it.''

<HEAD>July Gain, Double June's, 10th in a Row</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities surged 0.8 percent in July, the biggest increase in nine months, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the large July advance was double the 0.4 percent increase in June. It marked the tenth consecutive month that the index has risen without a decline and it was the largest advance since a 1.1 percent increase last October. Analysts had expected a big advance given the fact that employment at manufacturing plants climbed at the fastest pace this year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s July employment report. However, the consensus forecast was for a rise of around 0.6 percent. The manufacturing sector has been the star of the economy this year as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> producers, aided by a weak dollar, have enjoyed strong foreign sales. However, concern that the economy might be growing too rapidly, with demand outstripping production capabilities, was one of the reasons cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> when it raised the discount rate last week. The increase in industrial production came despite the fact that auto output actually fell during the month. Autos were assembled at an annual rate of 7.1 million units, down from June's pace of 7.5 million units. The production of light trucks also decreased during the month. The strength came from a continued surge in the production of business equipment, including computers, which jumped 1 percent in July following an equally strong 0.9 percent rise in June. Production of consumer goods rose 0.3 percent during the month, reflecting gains in appliance production and non-durable consumer goods as well. Output of construction supplies fell for the second consecutive month, dropping 0.3 percent following a 0.1 percent decline in June, reflecting a strike in the lumber industry. Overall, manufacturing production rose 0.8 percent in July with durable manufacturing and non-durable manufacturing posting identical 0.8 percent increases. Production at utilities rose 0.6 percent on top of a giant 2.5 percent increase in June. The big gains were attributed to high demand for electricity during the summer heat wave. Output at the nation's mines, including oil and gas drilling activities, rose 0.6 percent in July. This sector is now producing at a rate 4.9 percent higher than a year ago. Total output stood at 137.7 percent of its 1977 base of 100 and is 5.4 percent higher than a year ago.

<TEXT>
 Visiting <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> agreed to maintain its remaining ties with the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, including the granting of Jordanian passports to residents and maintaining open bridges across the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials, ending three days of talks with this kingdom's leadership, repeated a call for an eventual confederation with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in a Palestinian state. The talks, which ended Sunday, were the first between top <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> officials since King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> announced two weeks ago that he was severing legal and administrative ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The delegation arrived in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> today for talks with President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. A top <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative at the talks, <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Horani </PERSON>, said the two sides had `` passed over'' irritation his group felt because it was not consulted before <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s announcement. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> challenged the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to create a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The territories have been plagued by an 8-month-old Palestinian rebellion, during which more than 240 Palestinians and four Israelis have died. In the days preceding and following his speech, the Jordanian monarch canceled a $ 1.3 billion <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> development plan, fired thousands of civil servants there and ended <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> representation in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s parliament. The moves prompted speculation that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> might be trying to set up the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for failure or pressuring it into admitting it needs <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to achieve a Palestinian state. In a communique issued late Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation praised <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s moves in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which he ruled from 1948 to 1967. It said <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> had agreed to maintain current ties to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Horani </PERSON> told reporters those ties included the granting of Jordanian passports to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents, maintaining open bridges across the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, supervision of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools and economic links. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> om serves as a lifeline to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> by handling exports and funneling in money. A Jordanian statement after the meeting made no direct mention of those links or any agreement relating to them. It said only that the two sides agreed `` that the national unity between both sides is a stronghold'' and pledged continued support for the Palestinian cause. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> has long had uneasy relations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and it fought in 1970-71 to expel <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> commandos from its territory. Most of the 850,000 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents and many of the 650,000 residents of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> hold Jordanian passports, although <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> was under Egyptian control until 1967. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s recent moves have caused anxiety among <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents as well as Jordanians of Palestinian origin, who are in the majority in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. They fear their rights in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> might be curtailed. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> statement Sunday said the kingdom `` made clear <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s decision that Jordanians of Palestinian origin are Jordanian citizens and have full rights of citizenship and full duties. Also Sunday, a senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader was quoted as saying the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is seriously considering creating a provisional government that would recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The weekly Journal du Dimanche quoted <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s main deputy in the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, as saying: `` My solution for peace is for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, a discussion to establish the borders of this state and mutual recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> was quoted as saying, `` We are thinking seriously of creating a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state with a provisional government, legitimately established, whose political program would be completely different from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s current charter.'' He gave no details. The 20-year-old charter calls for replacement of the Jewish state with a `` democratic secular state.'' It has been a roadblock to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> relations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> interview received wide media coverage in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and the daily <ORGANIZATION> Hadashot </ORGANIZATION> said today that it might herald a significant change in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has banned as a terrorist group. `` We ca n't ignore what is happening to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> today,'' the paper said in an editorial. It said a move by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to set up a government recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` could change the status quo ... The argument that ` we do n't speak to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>' loses its force when we are talking about an organization which claims it is ready to negotiate on the basis of mutual recognition.'' <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> said a decision might be taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> at its meeting next month in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>.

 Twelve people have lived in a house converted into a church for more than seven months awaiting a tornado they believe will strike the area. They have put jobs, educations and families on hold since Jan. 3 and leave the Repairer of the <ORGANIZATION> Breach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> in Christ only to purchase food and supplies. The tornado shall `` kill many but spare the righteous,'' said <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, wife of the church's pastor, Elder M.L. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>. Since Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>' prophesy in December, five people have been removed from the church by court order. <PERSON> Rushell </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a teacher, and her 16-year-old daugther were taken from the church for psychiatric treatment after complaints by relatives. They were found mentally fit and returned to the church. <PERSON> Mancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 51, was forced to leave for kidney dialysis after friends and medical authorities got a court order. He later moved in with relatives. <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials removed two boys, ages 12 and 13, for not attending school and placed them in foster case. State law requires children to attend classes until age 16. `` God will take care of it all,'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said recently. `` We will stay here until it -LRB- the tornado -RRB- comes.'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>' wife had prophesied the tornado would come Jan. 3, and when it did n't, she predicted it would hit Jan. 24. When it failed to appear, <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said God delayed the twister because he wanted more people to know about it. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> refused to say how he and the other congregation members survive financially. <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' sister-in-law, said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> `` saved a lot of her money. My niece also receives $ 600 a month from Social Security. They could be using that to live on.''

 Despite calls for continued anti-government demonstrations, returning travelers reported calm in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital today. Analysts predicted few dramatic changes in its authoritarian system. Legislative and political party meetings are scheduled on Friday, presumably to choose a successor to President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who resigned last week after violent nationwide demonstrations. Travelers returning from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said throngs of people waited to withdraw money from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and others read a list of the dead and wounded pasted at the entrance of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> General Hospital. `` There were heaps of names,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>, a teacher from <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. On another wall was a cartoon showing a headless president and vice president with the caption in Burmese reading, `` <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> is being run by no one.'' By official count, at least 95 people were killed and 240 people wounded in last week's protests. Unconfirmed reports say hundreds of people were killed. Travelers quoted Burmese as saying they were anxiously awaiting the Friday party meetings. `` There are many things to be done by the new president,'' an Italian tourist, <PERSON> Antonella </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantica </PERSON>, quoted residents as saying. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was widely held responsible for ruthless suppression of dissent over the past quarter century. Leaflets over the weekend had called for more protests for full democracy from the government, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had reported that demonstrations were set for today. But the returning travelers and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> reported no protests. In a <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> conference on <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, analysts predicted few dramatic changes from the 26-year authoritarian rule of Ne Win. `` Ne Win will probably pick a second <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> who will not be such a hardliner but still do everything commanded by Ne Win,'' said <PERSON> Zaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Wai </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Burma-born </LOCATION> businessman and a spokesman for the large Burmese emigre community in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chayachok </PERSON> <PERSON> Chulsiriwongse </PERSON>, a Thai expert on <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, said he believed former strongman Ne Win remained as the `` elder statesman,'' working behind the political scenes. Ne Win was succeeded as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on July 26 by <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a retired army general. On July 30, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> detained 10 people, including a prominent government critic, Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>. Also detained was Sein Win, the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> correspondent of The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Chayachok and others said a successor to <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> might be more acceptable to some <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> but would be picked from among the top military or retired military officers who were part of the former Ne Win hierarchy. Students demands have included a multi-party system, restoration of basic human rights, the release of political prisoners and the right to set up their own organizations. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s state-owned official media meanwhile said leaders of student demonstrations are promising `` to avoid similar acts in the future.'' The Guardian newspaper said in its editorial today that it was `` satisfying to see the situation in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> improving day after day.''

 The rebel brother of Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said today the communist leader knows he can not rule <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> without help from Soviet troops. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Siddiquallah </PERSON>, 35, met with reporters for the first time since defecting to Moslem guerrillas 11 months ago. He arrived in this Pakistani border town this month, reportedly to seek political asylum in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> -RRB- knows he can not rule <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> without the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Siddiquallah </PERSON> told a news conference at the heavily-guarded headquarters of the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Guerrilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. The news conference was timed to coincide with the Aug. 15 deadline for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s withdrawal of half of its estimated 100,000 troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The deadline was set in a U.N.-brokered accord in April. The <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> said it had met its deadline. Military officials said their troops remained only in a few Afghan provinces, mainly from the capital, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, to the north. The rest of the Soviet troops are to be out by Feb. 15, 1989. The Kremlin began its pullout in May. Some Western, Pakistani and guerrilla sources have predicted <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Communist government will fall quickly after the Soviet troops leaves. A former Soviet military adviser in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsagolov </PERSON>, has expressed doubt the Afghan army can hold its own after the pullout. <PERSON> Siddiquallah </PERSON> refused to comment on whether he was seeking asylum in a third country. But guerrillas who harbored him said he was trying to obtain entry to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> declined comment on the report. <PERSON> Siddiquallah </PERSON> said he was a committed member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1960s, but grew disillusioned over the next decade as the party became the People's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The party seized power in a bloody 1978 coup, sparking widespread Moslem resistance. Soviet troops intervened in December 1979, replacing one communist regime with another. <PERSON> Sidiquallah </PERSON> said he tried to escape to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in 1981 but was drugged in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and hauled back to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, 43, a physician and former chief of the Afghan state security police, had him imprisoned in 1987 after failing to squelch his criticism of the government. He was released a few months later. <PERSON> Siddiquallah </PERSON> said he defected to the Moslem guerrillas in September 1987.

<TEXT>
 A former detective who was the basis for <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON>'s character in `` The French Connection'' says he's making a sequel on how heroin seized in the bust was later stolen from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> police vaults. The tale will unfold in a two-hour, $ 8 million movie <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> plans to start filming in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> in the fall, he said. <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>'s role in helping crack the French Connection heroin trafficking scheme was portrayed in the 1971 Academy Award-winning movie, in which <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON> played a character named <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> `` Popeye'' <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>. Now, <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> wants to tell the rest of the story _ how 112 pounds of heroin he and his partner recovered in 1962 were discovered missing a decade later from the police property clerk's office and ended up on the streets of southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` It was what I have to term as the perfect crime,'' <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said. `` Nobody was watching the store.'' He said the film, `` Internal Affair,'' will show how criminals got on the police force and over several years smuggled heroin out of <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> vaults, replacing it with worthless powder. <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> has formed a movie company, <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to produce `` Internal Affair,'' which he bills as being more intriguing than `` The French Connection.'' The stars have not been selected, but <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said they must have a drug-free background. The French Connection arrests capped an investigation filled with tedious surveillance and routine police work. It was the highlight of <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>'s 20-year police career. After the arrests, <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> was demoted and suspended for failing to catalog drugs seized as evidence. He retired in 1971 to make movies. <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, 58, has spent the past 15 years as a character actor in TV and movie police stories such as `` Badge 373,'' `` Police Story,'' `` Prime Cut'' and `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON>.''

 Guerrillas took a key provincial capital in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and a district near <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> as the Soviet pullout neared its halfway mark, state-run media said today in reports indicating <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops now are deployed only along escape routes. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> today heralded the Soviet fulfillment of an agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in April that required the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to pull out half of its more than 100,000 soldiers by Aug. 15. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that halfway point was reached over the weekend when a motorized rifle regiment of 200 vehicles and 3,000 troops left for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from the western city of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>. Those Soviets still in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> must leave the war-torn country within six months, according to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements. Pravda carried an article by Afghan leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in which he thanks the Kremlin for its support during the war that has divided <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since the April 1978 revolution. Soviet troops intervened in December 1979 to support a pro-Moscow regime. The article was accompanied by a graphic showing where the remaining Soviet soldiers are deployed. It indicates <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> troops are located only along two evacuation routes to the Soviet border, from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in the northeast and from <LOCATION> Shindand </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> in the west. Soviet military officials have said the pullout cleared Soviets from 25 of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 30 provinces, and the graphic accompanying <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s article showed soldiers are deployed in only a narrow ribbon through the remaining five provinces. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in the dispatch from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that guerrilla activity is the rise: `` In the first 10 days of August, extremists carried out 142 bombardments and attacks on populated areas around the country. As a result, 31 peaceful residents were killed and 113 wounded.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said two guerrilla groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, had captured the <LOCATION> Skakardar </LOCATION> district about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. It said the groups had a supply of 1,500 rockets they planned to fire at the Afghan capital. The news agency said rebels were planning to send other forces to districts of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> province to put further pressure on the capital. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, commander of Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, on Sunday confirmed Western reports that the northern provincial capital of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> had fallen to the rebels. He contended he had `` no doubt that in the very near future'' the Soviet-backed government would retake the strategic northern city. <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, which lies beyond the <LOCATION> Hindu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kush </LOCATION> mountains north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, was a government stronghold until late 1986, when U.S.-supplied Stinger missiles were brought to the mountainous area by the rebels and used to down numerous Soviet and Afghan planes. It is located near a five-province northern zone created earlier this year in which Afghan officials appear to be establishing an economic buffer zone between the rebel-controlled southern provinces and the Soviet border. The mountainous region north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and east of the strategic economic area, where <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s best natural resources are concentrated, has been repeatedly harassed by guerrillas over the past year. Rebels hiding in the hills and mountains through which the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> evacuation route traverses have used their higher vantage points to fire on the departing Soviet convoys. Soviet media have not disclosed the number of troops killed or wounded during the pullout, which began May 15. Officials of the Afghan government say their armed forces were capable of defending the country without Soviet troops. But some Western, Pakistani and guerrilla sources have predicted <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s communist government will fall soon after the Soviet soldiers are gone Reports reaching <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, said almost all provincial capitals remain in the Afghan government's control. However, guerrillas control most of the rural countryside and have made repeated seizures of the cities. They have been forced out of the provincial capitals by heavy Soviet aerial bombardment.

 Thousands of Roman Catholic pilgrims prayed today at a church here in preparation for a service tonight that many expect to bring miracles of healing. Officials estimate more than 20,000 people have journeyed from across the country to worship at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neumann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. About 5,000 people attended the first of five rosary services this morning. Hundreds camped out overnight on a grassy hillside outside the church, many bringing pillows, coolers and beach umbrellas. The temperature was expected to hit near 100 degrees today. On Sunday night, a Mass and rosary service was moved outdoors to accommodate about 2,500 people. Worshipers crowded onto the grassy slope beneath a huge altar built atop the church office for the weekend of worship and prayer. Rosary services at St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>, a church built underground, became the focus of nationwide attention after three parishioners claimed to have received messages from the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> during weekly rosaries. The three, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Slate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Constancio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, said that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> told them to expect a miracle on today's Feast of the Assumption, the day Catholics celebrate the ascension of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> into heaven. Mrs. <PERSON> Constancio </PERSON>, a former hospital therapist, said she and her husband quit their jobs to spend more time praying. While many handicapped people have come to the church hoping for physical healing, others said they seek spiritual renewal. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, his wife, niece and 11-year-old son drove from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and attended Sunday's Mass. `` My son has been sick a long time,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. `` Last year I had to carry him in my arms. Now he can walk, but he's still sick.'' `` Maybe my son can get better,'' he said. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said she came to strengthen her faith. `` Like they said in church, that so many people would come here to pray together is a miracle,'' she said. `` It really does n't matter what happens.'' The throng of worshipers Sunday sparked concern from officials about crowd control for the evening service. Parking lots surrounding the church were full with the morning Mass crowd, which police estimated at about 1,300. `` I've seen people leave their car in the middle of traffic if they're late for a -LRB- football -RRB- kickoff,'' said police Col. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON>. `` You can just imagine what would happen if they're late for a miracle.''

 The first shark patrols in six years continue off <LOCATION> Stinson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> after a great white shark was seen eating a seal. Sharks may be entering the area to feed on sick or dead sea lions and seals, which have been stricken in an epidemic of a kidney disease, said Dr. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Deiter </PERSON>, a veterinarian with <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors marine mammal life. Last week a surfer survived a shark attack near <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION>, about 300 miles north of <LOCATION> Stinson </LOCATION>, a popular beach just north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Lifegaurds are cruising the area once or twice a day for signs of sharks, said lifeguard <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>. No sharks have been spotted, he said. The patrols began Wednesday after a fisherman reported seeing a shark more than 13 feet long feeding about 300 yards off shore, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said. The beach will remain open unless a shark is spotted closer in, he said. No one has ever been attacked by a shark at <LOCATION> Stinson </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said.

 The Legislature today began the sixth day of a special session called to abolish a century-old system of local government purchasing, a reform prompted by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe of corruption. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reconvened this morning in an effort to settle differences that deadlocked conferees late Sunday night. Rep. H.L. `` Sonny'' <PERSON> Merideth </PERSON> said he would recommend today that the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> adjourn and go home. `` I'm sure the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will be disappointed as I know the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would,'' <PERSON> Merideth </PERSON> said. `` But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s position is that unless you can get something that is reasonable and workable and does n't have the potential to self-destruct, we can wait until another day for a better bill. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators had no immediate comment. The 1988 legislative session ended in May with conferees failing to agree on reform legislation. Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> remained optimistic. `` We're of the belief that nobody is interested in going home without resolving the matter,'' <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>' spokesman <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Treyens </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s Operation Pretense probe resulted in the arrests of 52 supervisors in 24 counties. Forty-three were convicted or pleaded guilty and 23 received prison sentences. The charges ranged from extortion to mail fraud. The House has approved a bill that would require counties to adopt central purchasing systems. Currently, county supervisors oversee all purchasing in their districts. The new system would give an appointed administrator power over day-to-day purchasing for the entire county, while keeping policy in the hands of supervisors. Supervisors would still award contracts, but the administrator would be responsible for purchasing materials and overseeing projects. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wants to exempt some small counties from the new plan, arguing they ca n't afford to hire an administrator. The House wants no exemptions. As state auditor for the four years before he was elected governor in 1987, <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> assisted the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in its investigation.

<TEXT>
 The Republicans, whose only task this week is to take a foregone conclusion to a foot-stomping anti-climax, found it necessary today to hold a morning session to start things off. This is what they meant by `` Morning in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>''? There even were delegates in the cavernous Superdome when the opening gavel fell at 10 a.m., attracted possibly by the routine business at hand but more likely because the Superdome is the coolest place in town. The weather in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is such that flies have been known to faint from the heat. Did the morning session really count since <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> were not peering down from their anchor booths? The program, to be charitable, seemed to have come out of files marked `` Not Ready for Prime Time,'' or, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, Is n't It Wonderful?'' The schedule was drawn to pay homage to Japanese-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, College Americans, Black Americans, Teen-age Americans Female Americans, Jewish-Americans and Americans Abroad. There also was a salute to youth. All this in barely two hours along with the call to order, two ROTC color guards, the national anthem, the invocation and the pledge of allegiance led by Soviet expatriate comic <PERSON> Yakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Smirnoff </PERSON>. He was introduced by party chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, as a man who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seeking freedom and `` like so many Americans has given more than he received _ he's given us the gift of laughter.'' <PERSON> Smirnoff </PERSON> did his stint and ended with his trademark, `` What a Country!'' The best-known of the speakers were <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, the former secretary of state who made it almost to the first primary before dropping out of the presidential race, and former Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, who pocketed two delegates in the first primary and then gave up. For their efforts, the two men were penciled in for 10:40 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is about as far out of the spotlight as you can get at a political convention. <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the outspoken daughter of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> stalwart, did n't fare much better: she had an early starting time, when she could be as blunt as she likes without offending too many. This was all a warm-up for the big finale at high noon: speeches by candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. A far piece from prime time? Yes. But you can bet that their campaign commercials will take full advantage of those clips of glory. Without showing the clock, of course.

<HEAD>Queen's Yacht Involved in Minor Accident in Harbor</HEAD>

 A harbor pilot and a deck hand were caught between two boats and slightly injured today during preparations to guide the royal yacht <LOCATION> Britannia </LOCATION> with Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on board into <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION> harbor, police said. The queen was asleep at the time of the pre-dawn accident, which <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> police said occurred in rough weather when a two-man pilot vessel pulled alongside a motor launch near the yacht so the pilot could transfer to the yacht. After the accident the pilot, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, 58, was treated for bruises at the <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infirmary </ORGANIZATION> and released, a police spokesman said. The deck hand, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, 57, suffered chest and abdominal bruising and was kept at the hospital for observation, the spokesman said. Both men were from <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, the oil capital of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the city closest to the <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> oil rig disaster last month in which 167 men lost their lives. Later in the dasy, the queen and her husband Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> met 40 people involved in the disaster. They then left by car for <LOCATION> Balmoral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, the royal summer retreat in the <LOCATION> Scottish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highlands </LOCATION>, where they will see their fifth grandchild for the first time. The Princess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the first child of the queen's second son <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, the Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was born Aug. 8 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and flew with her parents to <LOCATION> Balmoral </LOCATION> hours after leaving the hospital on Friday. The baby's name is expected to be made public after receiving approval from the queen. The princess is fifth in line to the throne.

 Campaigning for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nomination reached a fever pitch today in this convention city, as the one-man audience back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ declared he has still not made up his mind on a running mate. The Republican nominee-to-be stuck to his vow of silence on the choice, which he described as `` very important'' but not the decisive factor in the fall election. `` No. I have not decided,'' the incumbent vice president said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` I probably will say when I have decided.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said a bit later in the morning that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may well have made his decision. `` I think he felt like going into this weekend that he had received the input he wanted to,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> told reporters. `` Sometime over the weekend _ I include today in the weekend _ he was going to make his decision before he got down here'' Tuesday morning. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would be `` making a decision in private and then presenting it at the appropriate time.'' The timing for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement of his choice may be moved up from Thursday morning. A source said aides are discussing unveiling the choice Wednesday night, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate coming to the Superdome after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> formally wins the presidential nomination that evening. Asked if he were leaning toward one person, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` Yes, of course _ but some people I'd say.'' He brushed aside suggestions from Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> that conservatives could be upset by his decision. `` I think my choice will be widely accepted _ when I decide on who that choice is,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. But at the moment, the choice is a mystery, the only one left as the delegates gathered in the Superdome today for the convention's start The woman and men on the list of contenders were waiting for the telephone call from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, even as they rushed from reception to interview to rallies amid the trappings of full-fledged campaigns. Those thought to be under consideration included Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, former White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> made it crystal clear he wants the job, even as others took a different tack. `` If I were to be asked, I would be a terrific campaigner, and a terrific candidate and a terrific vice president,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said today. `` But I came here not expecting it, I do n't expect it today, I'm not sitting by the telephone.'' `` I do not expect to be asked to be vice president. ... I do expect to help,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on `` CBS This Morning.'' Others joked about the call to come. `` Communication is very important. In fact, if the system breaks down, nobody will get a call and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will run alone,'' joked Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. With both him and his wife on the list of possibilities, their telephone is especially crucial. `` We finally had to leave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to come down here so we got a recording on the machine at home, just in case they got the wrong number. It just says, ` I accept,''' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said at a breakfast. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, on his way to speak to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> delegation, told reporters: `` I have n't gotten any phone calls _ except from home.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> tried to take himself off the list, saying, `` I would be a liability for George'' in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' on Sunday. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that such public statements from prospects may not indicate he has taken them off his private list. `` I would n't say that at all,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` I have n't made up my mind yet.'' Former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, mentioned as a possibility, flew out of the city Sunday, saying `` If I'm on anyone's list, it's a list no one's told me about.'' But <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> still was not out of the running. Republican insiders have been urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to consider former White House Chief of Staff Baker. The former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator was due here today. The choice may not be any of these, warned <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, a friend of the vice president. After talking to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said the vice president is thinking about some other names. `` I know there are some people who have not been on those lists who are still in his mind, so it could be a surprise,'' said <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who will give the convention keynote speech on Tuesday night. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> denied seeking the No. 2 spot, while <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had a campaign mini-rally attended by former presidential hopeful <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>.

 The governor has asked state officials to review a program that has allowed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to spend his four-month prison term for selling cocaine in a $ 1,500-a-month luxury apartment with maid service. Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> feels the overall program is outstanding but `` believes people should be treated equally regardless of personal circumstances,'' spokesman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Berney </PERSON> said today. The son of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> is staying in one of 12 units in a building designed for expense-account business people on short assignments, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, 24, was convicted in April of selling a quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover police officer while a student at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> sentenced him to four months in prison. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was determined eligible for the state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s `` house arrest'' program, under which non-violent convicts can find their own housing and live under supervision by corrections officials. His apartment comes with maid service and cable TV, among other amenities, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We like to think of it as a cross between an apartment and a hotel, with the advantages of both,'' a spokeswoman for the building's owners told the newspaper. <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, said of <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s accommodations, `` This guy is a drug felon and he's living in conditions that 99.9 percent of the people of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> could n't afford.'' With the attention on the luxuries of the apartment, it is important to remember <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> `` does not have freedom in any sense of the word,'' <PERSON> Berney </PERSON> said. `` He works most of the time, and is restricted to his apartment for the rest of the time, with the exception of one hour a week in which he has to go grocery shopping.'' `` The department does n't provide the apartment,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, director of planning for corrections. `` The prisoner does that. We are only concerned that it meets minimum standards _ no drugs, no guns, no college kids hanging around. `` Obviously, some people Mr. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> among them, have more money than others, and they can afford a better place. The <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> probably would n't think much of his apartment. It's a matter of standards of living. And we are not paying for it so we ca n't decide a place is too luxurious if it meets the other criteria. Corrections officials, however, did say there was concern that dissatisfaction in the law enforcement community with the comfortable way in which <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> is serving time may threaten the future of the house arrest program. `` It's a disgrace to put a drug dealer into the program,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. `` I'm not happy about it and neither are other state's attorneys.

Sind has been the scene of ethnic violence involving native Pakistanis and Moslems who left <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> after its independence in 1947.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The army plans to erect a 14-mile electrified fence along a section of the <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> border following renewed complaints of guerrilla infiltrations. Military headquarters said the fence would be built near the Pontdrif border station in far-northern <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> province. Pontdrif is close to the point where the borders of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> intersect. There have been several encounters in the area in recent weeks between South African security forces and alleged guerrillas of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including a shootout in which a suspected guerrilla and a policeman were killed. The government has reiterated charges that <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> is major infiltration route for guerrillas entering <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to carry out sabotage and bombings. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> two years ago erected an electrified fence along a section of its border with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, primarily to cut down on the number of Mozambicans entering <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> illegally. Through February, 46 people had been killed trying to scale the 36-mile, high-voltage fence. Six people have been killed from contact with a shorter electrified fence on a section of the <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> border in 1985.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> closed the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s Marian Year on Monday with a Mass in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basilica </LOCATION>, exhorting the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> to help fight `` the threats which hang over the entire great human family.'' About 20,000 people crowded the church for the solemn 2 -LCB- - hour ceremony on the Feast of the Assumption, which marks the day the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> was received into heaven The ceremony, broadcast to 24 countries on four continents, concluded the Marian Year, a period designated by the Polish-born pontiff for special devotion to the mother of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. The period began on Pentecost Sunday, June 7, 1987. Sunday's liturgy was celebrated in the traditional Latin rite, but also included chants, hymns and prayers in 16 languages, including Albanian, Arabic, Russian and <LOCATION> Swahili </LOCATION>. `` Oh Mother ... be always with your children,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said in his homily in Italian. `` Help man, people, nations and humanity to rise up. Such a cry of the Marian Year resonated in various places in the world ... which feels in a particularly acute way the threats which hang over the entire great human family. He also underscored the urgency of his last encyclical, `` Social Concern of the Church,'' which called for action against economic and social injustices in the world. In a separate message at the end of the service, the pontiff looked ahead to the third millennium. `` Today, let us trustfully place the goal of the year 2000 and the prospects for the third millennium under the watchful intercession of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, sister and mother of the church,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. The ceremomy also included liturgies from the Eastern churches, with hymns sung by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION>, Greek, Albanian and Coptic-rite monks. One Ethiopian group chanted African songs to the beat of tribal drums. A group of Sicilian girls in traditional costumes threw thousands of rose petals on an altar representing the tomb of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has said Catholics can gain indulgence, or the pardon of temporal punishment for sin, by devoutly participating in seminars and special pilgrimages to mark the Marian Year. In conjunction with the <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Year </PERSON>, the pope is scheduled to release in the next few weeks a major document on the role of women in society and the church.

 A team of Soviet missile experts left <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on Monday after spending the weekend inspecting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear rocket sites in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rhein-Main Air Base said. The Soviet team of 40 inspectors arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Friday and visited four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear bases on Saturday and Sunday. The inspections are part of the treaty signed in December by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Under the pact, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to allow on-site inspections of their missile bases to ensure compliance with the terms of the treaty. The Soviets inspected <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 bases at <LOCATION> Neu-Ulm </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Neckarsulm </LOCATION>, both in southern <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. They also visited a Pershing 2 storage site at <LOCATION> Weilerbach </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Mannheim </LOCATION>, and a missile maintenance site in <LOCATION> Hausen </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. It was the second Soviet on-site inspection in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>State High Court Nixes `Executive Privilege' On Documents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> may not invoke `` executive privilege'' to keep documents from the public, the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. The unanimous decision came in the case of two homosexual men who are challenging the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration's decision to remove two young boys from foster care in their <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> home, but it could affect other issues. The Democratic presidential nominee's administration has cited `` executive privilege'' in a number of areas to avoid having to disclose internal memos and other sensitive papers. Opponents of plans to put a new prison in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> are seeking to force disclosure of documents showing how the site was chosen. `` There is no such privilege in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' the court said in an opinion written by Chief Justice <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON>. The justices said they found no justification in the state constitution or state law for withholding government documents. They said the creation of laws, rights or privileges was a policy issue best left to the Legislature. `` Had the framers of our government's structure intended to recognize in our constitution an executive privilege, it is reasonable to expect that they would expressly have created one,'' they said. `` It's a victory for accountability and open government,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Babets </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>. `` The public now has a right to know how its government comes to its decisions. That is a good thing in a democracy.'' Spokesmen for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were traveling with him to central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and were not immediately available for comment. The case began in 1985, when the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration removed two youngsters _ then aged 3 -LCB- and 22 months _ from <LOCATION> Babets </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>. After a study, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> promulgated rules for placing foster children that gave lowest priority to homosexual individuals who lacked experience as parents and gave first priority to married couples with children. Babets and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in January 1986 challenging the legality of the rules. The suit named <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, Human Services Secretary <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> DSS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Matava </PERSON> as defendants, although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was later dropped as a named defendant. Babets and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> argued that the policy discriminated and violated their constitutional rights to equal protection, free association and privacy. During the trial, lawyers for Babets and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> asked Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to order the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration to divulge certain documents relating to the policy-making process. After hearings and an inspection of the documents <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> ordered the government to surrender them. But <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> stayed his order and referred the constitutional questions to the appellate courts. Today's ruling specifically affirms <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>'s order, apparently forcing the state to release the requested documents.

 The police chief today dropped the word `` black'' from a directive ordering officers to stop and question black teen-agers at random to reduce crime in a racially-mixed neighborhood. Chief <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> said in a statement that the policy, which is under attack by a black lawyers' association in federal court, `` unfortunately ... has been perceived as racially motivated.'' `` To correct this misconception, I have modified this directive,'' he said. <PERSON> Lafayette </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolliver </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Thurgood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the group will press ahead with its suit to prevent police from carrying out the policy, announced July 8. The policy applies to the Old West End neighborhood. A 4:30 p.m. hearing was scheduled in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on the group's request for a temporary restraining order and $ 1 million in damages, the attorney said. The association sued on Friday on behalf of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a black teen-ager who was followed and then stopped by police in front of his house Wednesday. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, 19, was questioned but not charged with any offense, the suit said. `` This policy has given police carte blanche to do what they wanted in the Old West End. We are not only talking about black teen-agers being stopped, but also some black adults, too,'' <PERSON> Tolliver </PERSON> said this morning. The policy followed complaints by residents who had reported three violent incidents involving black youngsters. About 17 percent of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>'s 340,000 residents are black. The suit said the policy violates civil rights law and the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of association and protection against unlawful search and seizure. <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> defended the policy as necessary to stop violence in the neighborhood.

 Riot police used tear gas and beatings Monday to disperse thousands of radical students trying to march to the border for unification talks with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. At least 1,300 were arrested. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> told the nation his government will not tolerate violent campus protest. He said unchecked student activism would endanger the Olympic Games, which open Sept. 17 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Officers were seen taking away hundreds of protesters who tried to march from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to the border truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, 35 miles north of the capital, for talks with North Korean student leaders. Witnesses saw dozens of protesters and policmen injured but no injury statistics were available. Authorities said they arrested 1,300 students but released many after warnings. Riot police fired tear gas at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in western <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and charged into a crowd of students. They kicked protesters, beat them and dragged about 200 away. In a speech marking the 43rd anniversary of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s independence from Japanese colonial rule, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said: `` We can not any longer tolerate activities which destroy free democracy, our way of life,'' He said the Olympics will bring East and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> together, and `` peoples around the world are praying for the success of the Games. Therefore, the people and the government will not forgive anyone who spoils the festival through mob action or the throwing of firebombs, no matter for what plausible cause.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> delivered a similar warning Friday, accusing radical students and dissidents of siding with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and trying to overthrow the government. In the speech Monday, he also proposed a summit with President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to discuss the future of the peninsula, which was divided at the end of World War II. Similar proposals in the past have led nowhere, but the two Koreas are considering parliamentary talks on easing tension. A few hours after the speech, thousands of radical students rallied at <LOCATION> Yonsei </LOCATION> and tried to march into the streets on their way to the border. Troopers in green combat fatigues and black-visored helmets fired tear gas and charged the protesters, who shouted `` Unite the fatherland!'' and `` Yankee go home!'' Students who did not resist huddled in groups on the ground, clinging to each other as policemen beat them with fists and even riot shields. Senior officers hit and slapped their own men in an attempt to stop the beatings. One commander slashed at troopers with a riding crop. Many students apparently decided to let themselves be arrested, a change from their normal tactic of violent resistance. About 100 members of the `` unification vanguard'' tied themselves together so police would have to arrest them as a group. Among those detained were 12 leaders who were to have represented <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> at the talks Monday in <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. Police blocked a similar march to <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> on June 10. About 3,000 radical students tried to march Monday, a much smaller number than in June, and there was virtually no evidence of public support. The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have seized on national unification in their campaign against the government. South Korean authorities declared Monday's march illegal and deployed 25,000 riot police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to stop it. They insist that all dialogue with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> be conducted through government channels. When their march from <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> was blocked Monday, students regrouped on campus and surged out with rocks and firebombs to do battle for an hour with about 7,000 riot police. Volleys of tear gas were fired from armored police vans. About 600 protesters were arrested downtown and in other parts of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. In one confrontation in the heart of the capital, 700 students lay down on the pavement with their hands interlocked as police charged, and 200 were taken away. Student leaders told a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> they would not stop trying to oust the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government and reunite <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Dozens of students cut their fingers with razors and wrote four Korean letters meaning `` national unification'' in blood. They denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, saying <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supports military rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and demanded withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based here under a mutual defense treaty.

<HEAD>Estonians Told By Media of Stalin-Nazi Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALLINN, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Estonians have been told for the first time by state-run media of the secret agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> that paved the way 49 years ago for <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> takeover of the three independent Baltic states. Activists who have been pressing for an independent <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> claim publication of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocols portends a change in <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> policy. `` The only normal and acceptable situation for us is complete independence,'' Eve Parnaste, an activist with the unofficial <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. `` I am personally convinced that within two years <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> will again be an independent country.'' Advocates of a less-radical change say the public airing of the pact is a long overdue result of reform, but one that will allow open discussion of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s turbulent history. The resurgence of nationalist feeling in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> poses a thorny problem for Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who also faces ethnic unrest in Armenian and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and elsewhere. Details of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact signed on Aug. 23, 1939, were disclosed by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and Thursday, and during a Friday broadcast of Estonian Radio. The first official disclosure of the secret agreement in the Estonian-language daily makes clear that the states of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> were forcibly occupied by Soviet troops, according to <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> residents who translated part of the newspaper report for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The disclosure has stirred up nationalist sentiments among some Estonians, who say it nullifies <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s political hold on the republic. Activists in the republics demonstrated last year on the 48th anniversary of the signing of the pact, demanding that its provisions be made public. Nationalist sentiment is likely to surface again on the 49th anniversary. Ms. <PERSON> Parnaste </PERSON> and other activists said they have notified authorities that they will demonstrate in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>'s central square and lay flowers in tribute to the victims of Stalinism Thousands rallied last year on the anniversary here and in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, while the memorial in the Lithuanian capital of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> drew about 500 people. <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Liegzdins </PERSON> of the Latvian Club for <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ainars </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilcens </PERSON> of the Movement for <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> were in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> over the weekend to meet with activists about anniversary plans. <PERSON> Liegzdins </PERSON> said 20,000 Latvians are expected to turn out for an unsanctioned rally in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> on Aug. 23. The pact that was an official secret but generally known among residents of the Baltic states instituted a non-aggression policy between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> while the Soviets occupied the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> invaded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The first article about the pact was accompanied by a photograph of Stalin toasting the agreement with its signatories, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Molotov </PERSON> and German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribbentrop </PERSON>. The newspapers were obtained here by The AP, and many <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> residents reported hearing the radio broadcast during a popular program Friday. `` For the first time people here got to know of the secret, additional treaty between Molotov and <PERSON> Ribbentrop </PERSON> _ dividing spheres of influence between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' said journalist <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Raid </PERSON>. `` Now, for the first time, historians admit this was aggression.'' <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Undusk </PERSON>, a leader of the first unofficial political party sanctioned by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials, said many Estonians have known for years of the secret agreement, but official airing of the pact will allow open discussion for the first time. `` There was happiness that finally there has been official recognition of this _ that they've come to this point,'' <PERSON> Undusk </PERSON> said. His group, known as the Peoples Front, was formed earlier this year to work for broader implementation of the reforms outlined by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Undusk </PERSON> says his organization, which claims 60,000 members, is not separatist but wants to give Estonians more control over their republic's affairs. One prominent <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> resident who is familiar with the organization's policies and supports them said the group's ultimate aim is to return power to citizens of Estonian nationality and close the borders to non-Estonians. The native population's resentment of <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> domination has surfaced in repeated demonstrations this year, and has been addressed to some degree by party officials. Estonian party leader <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> was replaced by a native Estonian, <PERSON> Vajno </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaelaes </PERSON>. One party official, who did not want to be identified, said <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> whose name orignally was Vainov. Party officials also lifted a 48-year-old ban on public display of the blue, black and white flag of independent <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, and growing number of residents of this capital city are sporting ribbons and pins with the national colors. Small flags are sold at a cooperative store in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> for about $ 8.40. The 1977 Soviet Constitution allows the population of a region to secede from the union, although all past attempts have been halted quickly by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. A referendum for secession of an entire republic has never been put to a vote. However, the unofficial political parties in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> plan to present candidates for next year's contested elections to a new governmental body, which in turn will choose the membership of the republic's legislature and executive body, which are empowered to present issues for public vote.

 Republicans opened their 34th national convention today with an unusual morning session as nominee-in-waiting <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> revealed from afar he has narrowed his list of potential running mates. The first order of business was an attack on Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a champion of `` the failed liberal policies of yesterday.'' `` What a country,'' exclaimed comedian <PERSON> Yakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Smirnoff </PERSON> after reciting the pledge of allegiance to a surprisingly large mid-morning gathering of delegates in the cavernous <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Superdome. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remained in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> prepared a prime-time, farewell address to Republicans who twice launched him to landslide victories. `` I think the president will be very personal and the crowd reaction may be emotional,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, the White House chief of staff. `` It's going to be a grand salute to the president.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks also were intended to arouse political passions for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his loyal lieutenant. With <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in most national polls, the attacks on Democrats began early with speeches by former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, two of the five men <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defeated en route to Wednesday night's nomination. The vice president spent his morning in a round of television interview shows, fending off questions about his running mate. `` I think my choice will be widely accepted when I decide on who that choice is,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I've not decided,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Asked if he were leaning toward someone, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` Yes, of course but -LRB- toward -RRB- some people, I'd say.'' His campaign manager, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, said he thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might have actually decided on someone. Meanwhile, the rhetoric began in earnest in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` Our party has brought <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> back to economic strength, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> bush </PERSON>, a man with unequalled experience in government, is the man who will put its newest ideas to work,'' said du Pont. Looking back at last month's Democratic convention, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said, `` The most interesting thoughts of that gathering came not from its presidential candidate, who represents the failed liberal policies of yesterday. No, the most interest thoughts came from the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' To a bare sprinkle of applause, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was more suited to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and invited him to switch his allegiance. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, putting aside the harsh criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> he sounded during the primary campaign, said the vice president `` represents safe and progressive change for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Safe in that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will build on the solid accomplishments of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency. `` Americans know that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will trash them,'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> declared. Unlike <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> did not spare <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from criticism. Noting that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> frequently says a bird needs two wings to fly, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said, `` Maybe he forgot some birds with two wings can not fly at all, like the extinct Dodo bird that was too stupid to defend itself or the Ostrich which prefers to live with danger by ignoring it.'' Amid intense speculation about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning,'' `` I do not expect to be asked to be vice president.'' Her husband, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, also a prospect, said, `` I think <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> would be an excellent choice.'' The vice president, his understudy days nearing an end, will arrive here Tuesday, just as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves town for a long vacation at his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ranch. In a symbolic passing of the baton, the two men will meet briefly at the airport before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> heads downtown for a big welcoming rally. `` It's a big moment for me. It's the culmination of a lot of years of politics,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told one interviewer. `` It feels like this is it.'' Speaking about his selection of a running mate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I think it's a very important choice and there's a lot of very good people from whom to make a selection. I think my choice will be widely accepted when I decide on who that choice is.'' Are people who have asked not to be considered actually off his list? `` Well, I would n't say that at all. I have n't made up my mind yet,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Aides said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may depart from his plan to make his decision known on Thursday and instead unveil his choice Wednesday night, then make a dramatic appearance before the convention _ the same timetable <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> employed eight years ago when he named <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as his vice presidential choice. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> acted like they were auditioning for the job, appearing on Sunday talk shows to bash Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> took himself off the list of potential candidates, saying `` I would be a liability for <PERSON> George </PERSON>'' as a result of advocating curbs on Social Security, veterans funding. The newest name in the fast-churning gossip mill was <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff. Republicans outside the campaign were urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to take another look at the former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leader, a source said. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, sworn in only Friday, made clear he was available. `` I have a job to do for this president and until I've heard anything from the vice president, I'm ready to go to work as attorney general.'' Many delegates seemed content to wait for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision. `` It adds a little Cajun spice to the convention,'' said <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> GOP chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Levesque </PERSON>. `` Otherwise, it would be dull.'' This fabled party town seemed anything but dull, with delegates packed into parties and brunches from the French Quarter to the private homes in the fashionable Garden District. Visitors could barely go anywhere without hearing jazz, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> anthem. The president, eager to pass on power to his loyal lieutenant, used his welcoming rally Sunday to give a preview of his prime-time convention address tonight. He called last month's Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> `` the biggest masquerade since last year's <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>.'' `` The masquerade is over,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` It's time to talk issues, to use the dreaded ` L' word, to say the policies of our opposition and the congressional leadership of his party are liberal, liberal, liberal.'' The crowd chanted `` four more years, four more years'' for the president, a reminder of the difficulty <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faces in trying to win the same enthusiastic support that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> enjoyed in two landslide victories. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>. `` I would n't say he would enjoy as lopsided victories as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did.'' In the aftermath of the Democratic convention, polls showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by as much as 17 points. More recent surveys show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has narrowed the gap, but his own staff believes he still is behind by about 8 to 10 points.

 Here is the transcript of the speech by former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to the Republican National Convention on Monday. Mr. Chairman, fellow Republicans, ladies and gentlemen: I am honored to address the opening session of our party's convention For me, this occasion is also a reunion with my former colleagues from the Republican primary debates. We had our differences then, but we are all agreed on one thing now: We are dedicated to making <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I am confident that in November the people will choose <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because he represents safe and progressive change for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, safe in that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will build on the solid accomplishments of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency. Americans know <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will trash them. Thanks to the Reagan-Bush achievements of the past eight years, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s international standing has been literally transformed. When I last spoke to a Republican convention in 1980, we saw a nation thrown off balance by blunder and gloom. The Soviets were on the march everywhere. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> had been seized. Soviet surrogates were triumphant in <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. A cruel war raged in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, our allies were disheartened and freedom was in retreat. And all the Democrats could offer was indecision and malaise. Today, eight years later, the policy of peace through strength has begun to pay off. The Russians are leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Their surrogates in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> are in trouble. The <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> conflict is drawing to a conclusion. The Soviets are negotiating our arms control agenda of reduction and cuts, designed not to increase Soviet superiority. Democracy, not communism, is on the march. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> helped make this happen and he is indeed the safe candidate for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But he also knows what changes are needed to strengthen the most successful administration in recent history. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> team has made progressive change central to our party platform at this convention. In contrast, hard evidence confirms that Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not the candidate of safe progressive change, but the candidate of radical and dangerous change. He does not believe in peace through strength. As chief executive of the state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> he has steadfastly refused to permit the critical warning and communication facility _ the <ORGANIZATION> Ground </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GWEN </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ to be built in his state, leaving a serious gap in our nation's defense. He will turn over our global peace-keeping obligations exclusively to international organizations _ the <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>. In the Third World, he will resurrect the sterile policies of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Second Fire In Three Days at Landmark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The second fire in three days broke out today in the 102-story Empire State Building, this time on the 50th floor, forcing the evacuation of dozens of office workers, the Fire Department said. The fire was brought under control just after noon, about a half hour after it was reported, but firefighters continued checking all floors to make sure the flames had n't spread, said department spokesman <PERSON> Efrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrilla </PERSON>. No injuries were reported. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. The Fire Department said the blaze was in an electrical conduit in a 50th floor stairwell. However, a building spokesman, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, said the fire was in trash in a stairwell between the 51st and 53rd floors. Five floors of the building's midsection were evacuated because of heavy smoke, a spokesman for the management said. On Friday, a fire broke out in an 86th floor shaft. After it was brought under control, firefighters discovered that it had climbed to the 102nd floor. The observation decks at both those levels were closed and some 1,500 tourists evacuated. That fire also put off the air for several hours eight radio stations whose antennas are atop the building.

<BYLINE>To Recall Beatles Lyrics, Love Is Not All You Need
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 You think you know your favorite Beatles songs, right? But can you remember all the lyrics, and can you get all the correct words in the correct places? Psychologists want to know. For example, in the song `` Rocky Raccoon,'' what comes after the opening line: `` Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>''? -LRB- Answer: The second line is, `` There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon.'' -RRB- Researchers asked 76 <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students to recall and write down all the words to 32 Beatles songs. They were given only the title and the first line of each. The purpose was to gain insight into how the mind remembers, say researchers <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> of <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Half the students were assigned one group of 32 randomly chosen songs; the others were given a different group of 32 tunes. Researchers analyzed the students' performance on the 25 best-remembered songs. Multiplying the number of lines in those songs times the 38 students assigned each song gave a maximum possible score of 16,416 recollections. The students achieved only 3,378 with any degree of accuracy. But the interesting thing, <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> said Sunday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, is that recall for details of the lines they remembered was remarkably good. Of the 3,378 lines students wrote down, they recalled 2,371 without error, 454 more with only one error and 227 with only two errors. And even the flawed lines generally followed the meaning, rhythm and poetic features of the original, suggesting people use those characteristics to recall such material, <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> said. For example, rhythm and rhyme were preserved in such errors as remembering the phrase `` and you know you should be glad'' as `` and you know you ca n't be sad,'' from the hit `` She Loves You.'' Only four of 32 students in one group remembered that Rocky Raccoon was carrying a gun to `` shoot off the legs of his rival.'' But some guesses were close, such as to shoot off the head or hands or `` shoot out the lights'' of the man who stole his woman. Rhyming words at the end of lines were well recalled, but sometimes there was some unintentional editing. One student turned `` wonder how you manage to feed the rest'' from `` Lady <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'' into `` wonder how you manage to be caressed.'' Sometimes a flubbed phrase did n't even rhyme with the original. `` Having read the book'' from the song `` A Day in the Life'' became `` having read the play'' in one student's version. Other errors kept the same sounds within lines, as when the phrase `` always know sometimes think it's me,'' from `` Strawberry Fields Forever,'' became `` always though sometimes think it's free. In another case, from `` Yesterday,'' the line `` I said something wrong now I long for yesterday'' became `` I must move along but I long for yesterday.'' And as for the student who wrote `` for efficient finger pies'' while trying to recall `` a four of fish and finger pies'' from the song `` <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>,'' maybe he just never heard it right in the first place.

<DATELINE>CZESTOCHOWA, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> on Monday condemned abortion, pornography and sexual promiscuity in a speech that ignored the nation's pressing social and economic problems. The primate's address to 150,000 pilgrims who had gathered at the <PERSON> Jasna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gora </PERSON> monastery outside <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION> marked a significant departure from sermons in recent years that have taken <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist leadership to task on a variety of issues The sermon came three days after <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> met with Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to discuss ways to speed up economic and political reforms. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> made no reference to the banned trade union Solidarity, which this month marks the eighth anniversary of the strikes that launched the outlawed federation, but scores of red-and-white Solidarity banners covered the iron gates below the monastery. A white flag with `` Solidarity'' lettered across it in red was raised by <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> activist <PERSON> Seweryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaworski </PERSON>. The homemade banner flew in full view of church dignitaries seated on a temporary outdoor platform and could be seen by the pilgrims massed in a field below. Throngs of Polish pilgrims from across the nation come together for the feast day of <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION>, regarded as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s patron saint They huddled under umbrellas for protection from the heat, but dozens fainted. The 14th century monastery is the home of the <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> icon, an age-darkened painting of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> dating to the 8th or 9th century which some believers credit with miraculous powers. It is <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most revered religious symbol. In the 20-minute sermon, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> made no mention of the event many Poles consider the miracle of the 20th century: the Aug. 15, 1920, victory by <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilsudski </PERSON> over the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in a battle known as the `` miracle on the <LOCATION> Vistula </LOCATION>,'' referring to the river which cuts through <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> that the Soviets failed to cross. The victory then saved <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> from Soviet <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> in June attended celebrations marking the 1,000 anniversary of Christianity in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and he hopes to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> again, perhaps as early as this fall. In the past, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> has used the feast day sermon as an occasion to deliver major Polish church policy statements. Last year, the primate urged the Polish government to work toward establishing diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. In 1986, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> warned Polish leaders not to embark on a campaign to teach atheism in the nation's schools. In Monday's sermon, however, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> followed church teachings against abortion, pornography and sexual promiscuity, and urged the pilgrims to practice `` sexual purity.'' His strongest attacks were leveled against the practice of in vitro fertilization and abortion. `` Every destruction of joined human cells is the killing of a human being,'' <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> said. The church estimates that 94 percent of the nation's 37.5 million people are Catholics.

 Peasants in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have cut down and stolen more than 10,000 trees from a state-run forest since the beginning of this year, an official newspaper said Monday. The Legal Daily said thousands of peasants have entered the <LOCATION> Wugong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> forest in <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> province, felling and stealing trees to be used in construction and for fuel. In one incident in April, the falling trees injured forest rangers. The report said illegal logging has been increasing because officials fine only the most serious offenders, while others are asked to write self-criticisms. Last year, 247,100 acres of forests in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were destroyed by illegal logging and $ 24.5 million in trees stolen, the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily reported in March. In a related incident Aug. 6, about 30 farmers were injured when they tried to stop 20,000 peasants from picking clean a field with almost $ 600,000 worth of watermelons, the Legal Daily said.

 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate, today contrasted <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` safe and progressive'' policies with those of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whom he called the `` diminutive clerk from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' In a morning adress to the Republican National Convention, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would pursue <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policies that have put the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a stronger position worldwide. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, who served as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first secretary of state, dropped out of the Republican presidential race on Feb. 12, four days before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. At the time, he endorsed Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> for president and made little effort to conceal his dislike of Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the party's designated presidential nominee. Today, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> backed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying the vice president represented `` safe and progressive change, safe in that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will build on the solid accomplishments of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency.'' He said Americans are in a better position now than they were eight years ago before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was elected. `` When I last spoke to a Republican convention in 1980, we saw a nation thrown off balance by blunder and gloom,'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said. `` Today, eight years later, the policy of peace through strength has begun to pay off.'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> stressed the differences between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor chosen as the Democratic presidential nominee, and his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` You have to admit <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was good theater,'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said, referring to the Democrats' convention last month. `` It was an off-Broadway revival of ` The Odd Couple,' starring the diminutive clerk from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the tall stranger from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` But when you look at the real Dukakis-Bentsen foreign policies, you have to ask ` are they running against us or against each other?''' The two men differ on some foreign policy issues, including military aid for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes the aid; <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> supports it. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> also compared the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a bat `` flying erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down for extended periods in dark, damp caves up to its navel in guano.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s friends gave him a football jersey that had the number `` 2'' on its back _ not the former professional quarterback's playing number but the one of the job he seems to be seeking. `` Could I be a good vice president? You bet,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman, said Monday as the Republican National Convention was opening. `` I was a good second string quarterback, and I can be a good second string quarterback for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Like the rest of the convention, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is awaiting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s word on a running mate for the Republican ticket this fall. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination after failing to win a primary, is taking a highly visible role in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> during the convention _ all the while insisting he's not campaigning for the vice presidential nomination, not expecting it, not sitting by the telephone. But <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s enthusiastically loyal conservative followers have been campaigning on his behalf, and hundreds of them jammed a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> hotel Sunday night to cheer wildly his every word and present the jersey to the former quarterback for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chargers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bills </ORGANIZATION>. `` Hey, my number was 15,'' he said feigning surprise. Speaking to reporters a day later, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he was n't campaigning for the job, while with his usual enthusiasm suggesting he'd really like it `` If I were to be asked, I would be a terrific campaigner, and a terrific candidate, and a terrific vice president,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` But I came here not expecting it, I do n't expect it today, I'm not sitting by the telephone. `` I'm going to campaign just as vigorously for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> off the ticket as I would on the ticket,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` If he asks, I would want it. If he does n't ask ...'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, not finishing his thought. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who likes to deliver a message that combines economic conservatism with an appeal to broaden the party to include minorities, never won more than 13 percent of the vote in the initial <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primaries. That was in spite of his emergence as a favorite of many of the party's conservative wing. Conservative activists pushing his candidacy point to his youthful appearance, his appeal to blacks and other minorities, and to his background in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he was born and educated, as potential boosts to the ticket. Some supporters acknowledge, however, that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> might not be best suited to the role of a negative, attacking campaigner if that is what the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign decides it wants in a vice president. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> suggested that himself when he said, `` I do not believe the purpose of the vice president is to tear down, to diminish, to show disdain, to show disrespect, to bash.'' One leading <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> booster around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> has been Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, who has led a campaign pressuring <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to pick a running mate that is from the party's most conservative wing. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> would fill that description. `` If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was watching tonight, or the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> operatives, they'd have to be impressed,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said as he left the huge reception <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> sponsored `` It was almost climactic.'' With <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> keeping silent on his choice, much of the speculation has centered around other names. One questioner asked <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> if it did n't appear that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed to be suggesting he wants to pick someone like <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> _ but not <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> himself. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s answer recalled Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s measured response after he was passed over for the No. 2 spot on that party's ticket last month. `` I am too cool, I'm too collected, I'm too qualified to answer that question,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` Who knows?''

<HEAD>China to Link Wage Raises With Price Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> soon will give its workers a large raise and link further pay increases to its inflation rate to stave off growing unrest in its cities, sources said Monday. The move marks a step back from ambitious price reforms undertaken in the last few years. But the plan still should be considered a victory for liberal-minded reformers such as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources said. The sources said Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, Vice Premier <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON> and other conservatives have called for a freeze on reforms which are slowly opening the economy to market forces. Both sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, recently attended meetings of top government officials in the resort town of <LOCATION> Bedaihe </LOCATION>. The sources said the new plan to link pay with price rises would be announced in about a month. `` It will allow the reforms to continue and that is the critical point,'' said one source. He estimated that the average worker's annual salary of $ 246 would go up at least 8 percent. The other said urban workers could be getting a 28 percent raise. If prices rise, they said, the workers would be given further wage increases. The sources said the pay increases would replace subsidies of about $ 2.70 a month that the government has been giving urban workers to offset inflation, the highest in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 39-year history as a communist nation. Prices in June were 19 percent higher than they were in June 1987, according to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. The inflation has hit urban workers the hardest. Peasants, who make up 75 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1.07 billion people, generally have missed some price increases because they produce their own food. Inflation has been rising in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because the government has pushed far-reaching economic reforms aimed at ending state controls over prices and allowing the value of goods to be controlled by the market. In May, the government raised the state-set prices of vegetables, pork, sugar and eggs by about 60 percent. In late July, it increased the price of brand-name cigarettes and spirits by as much as 790 percent. The elimination of government-fixed prices has caused the cost of some goods to soar as the economy fails to keep up with rising consumer demand. In addition, interest rates in Chinese banks are much lower than the inflation rate, so consumers want to spend now before their money loses too much value. The Chinese sources said that under the plan banks will also raise their interest rates to encourage saving. The Economic Daily ran a front-page editorial Monday calling for such a move. In May, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials as saying riots and other signs of social turmoil were on the increase in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The sources said that in addition to placating workers, the goverment was raising salaries to increase worker productivity. `` We ca n't continue with the reforms if the economy is n't growing,'' said one source The Chinese sources, interviewed separately, described themselves as members of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s liberal camp.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> was quiet Monday and <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> crowded in front of a hospital to search for names of friends and relatives on a list of the casualties in last week's violence, a Western tourist reported. There were calls for more protest, and <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> authorities closed a crossing between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ranong </LOCATION> province and the market town of <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s southernmost province of <LOCATION> Megui </LOCATION> Last week, security forces in <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> were said to have turned against the authoritarian military government and allowed thousands of protesters to march unhindered. Analysts said they doubted the new <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> leadership expected to be chosen Friday will make dramatic changes in the one-party system Ne Win installed 26 years ago. Hard-liner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned Friday as <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s president and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after five days of rioting in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and two dozen other towns and cities across the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation. State-run <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio said the party and legislature would meet on Friday. Ne Win resigned last month and was replaced by <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, whose 17 days in office produced a popular uprising against the quarter-century of repression, economic disaster and isolation. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio said at least 95 people were killed and 240 wounded last week, but Western diplomats believe the toll was several times greater. They said it appeared most victims were unarmed, hit by bullets fired into crowds by soldiers and police. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was joining an international effort to donate medical supplies through the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>, a teacher from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, said she watched people read a list of casualties Monday that was posted at the entrance of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> General Hospital. `` There were heaps of names,'' she said. Also in front of the hospital compound was a crude shrine residents built on the spot where they said security forces shot doctors and nurses. Various sources have confirmed shooting and casualties in the area, but no reliable details are available. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Swan </PERSON>, an Australian moviemaker, had told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he visited the hospital Saturday and saw about 300 people who were wounded in the rioting. Ms. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> and other Western tourists who arrived Monday from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> described the city as quiet, with most barricades removed but the city hall still off-limits. They said people pushed back barbed-wire barriers and helped clear streets in the Bogyoke market district. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> remains under martial law, imposed Aug. 3, and an 8 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew decreed six days later. The state-run radio also reported calm and said student leaders in some areas reported to authorities for `` pledge-making ceremonies,'' at which they promised `` to avoid similar acts in the future.'' Leaders of the Christian and Hindu communities met Monday with the deputy minister of home and religious affairs, <LOCATION> Kyi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myunt </LOCATION>, and appealed for peace and the rule of law, the radio said. It reported a similar meeting Sunday involving Islamic leaders. On Sunday, Western diplomats reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said students were handing out leaflets calling for pro-democracy protests now that they had achieved the resignation of <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a former general hated for brutally suppressing dissent during the Ne Win's rule.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will weaken <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by withdrawing support for the MX and the Migitman missiles and reduce SDI to a constrained research and development program. Until recently he has even opposed the B1 and Stealth bombers. Of course the Democrats know that people would reject the real <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. So, as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said, he is traveling incognito. You have to admit <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was good theater. It was an off-Broadway revival of `` The Odd Couple,'' starring the diminutive clerk from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the tall stranger from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But when you look at the real Dukakis-Bentsen foreign policies you have to ask yourself, `` are they running against us or are they running against each other?'' And then there's the Reverend <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> who likes to say `` a bird likes to fly on two wings.'' Maybe he forgot some birds with two wings ca n't fly at all _ like the extinct dodo bird that was too stupid to defend itself, or the ostrich which prefers to live with danger by ignoring it. In fact, the more you look at it, the less the Democratic ticket looks like a bird at all. It's more like a bat _ blind as a bat, endowed with the sophisticated sensing mechanisms we saw in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> but totally unable to differentiate. Flying erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down for extended periods in dark, damp caves up to its naval in Guano. Lord, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't need any more of that. And so, my friends, you and I know that next November's election may be the most important since World War II.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, proclaiming that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space effort has `` lost its sense of purpose, vision and pride'' under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, today proposed the creation of a Cabinet-level post to direct the nation's space program. `` Despite an annual <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> budget of over $ 10 billion per year, our space program is in disarray. It suffers from a lack of a clearly defined purpose and ineffective top management and our space policy is lost in a maze of bureaucratic committees,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a statement issued at a luncheon he attended with local elected officials and labor and business leaders. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, echoing comments made earlier in the day in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> by his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said he would also back continued development of a permanent manned space station and would re-establish a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet-level </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, to be chaired by <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, was in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> as part of a two-day visit to the central part of the state. Arriving here, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was met by about 100 protestors, about half anti-abortion and half opponents of his plan to locate a prison in central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. He was also hosting an event marking the start of the first phase of implementation of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' universal health care law, which will guarantee health insurance to virtually all workers by 1990. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will spend the night at home in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and return to several other central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities Tuesday.

 Activists opposed to the government's AIDS policies lay down on the steps of city hall today in a protest at the Republican National Convention, where demonstrations have resulted in five arrests. Overall, organizers say fewer protesters than expected have shown up at the convention. Today's demonstration, which attracted about 50 people, was peaceful, unlike Sunday's incident when five gay activists were arrested at President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s welcoming party following a shoving match. Before lying down in a symbolic `` die-in,'' protesters at city hall called for more government support for social and medical programs for victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. On Sunday, the gay activists were booked on charges of disturbing the peace after a scuffle with bystanders during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s welcoming speech at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Convention Center. Other demonstrations came off peacefully, including one Sunday at which protesters confronted Roman Catholic Archbishop <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON> and criticized church policy on homosexuality. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a spokesman for CARE, an umbrella group for various activists, said he had expected 12 national groups to join nine local ones for convention protests. But he said turnout from the national groups was lower than that, although he was not sure how many groups had shown up. Groups scheduled to demonstrate today, the official opening of the convention, included Food Emancipation, <ORGANIZATION> Anarchists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> and Democrats and Friends of the Homeless Hope House. On Sunday, five protesters with the gay rights group Act Up were arrested after they showed up at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech with signs criticizing his AIDS policy. A shoving match ensued and fighting broke out, police spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryson </PERSON> said. He said the protesters started the fight, but gay activist <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kight </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> denied the charge. `` A group of young men physically attacked them,'' <PERSON> Kight </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> tried to intervene to protect them, but the police arrested them.'' Police said today that all five had been released from jail. At one end of the French Quarter on Sunday, about 150 women representing some 20 feminist groups gathered at <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are here to tell the world that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has turned its back on women's rights,'' said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. `` ... But this does not let the Democrats off the hook.'' In the incident at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> where the archbishop appeared, the demonstrators staged a homosexual `` kiss in.'' `` We kiss in an aggressive demonstration of affection,'' said a statement demonstrators read through a bullhorn. `` We kiss to protest the cruel and painful bigotry that affects the lives of lesbians and gay men.'' Some of the 40 to 50 protesters surged around Archbishop <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON> after he came out of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> Cathedral between morning Masses. `` We're used to demonstrations. <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> is where everything happens,'' <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON> told a man in a Sunday suit as he shook hands with parishioners. Two protesters went into an extended clinch just behind <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON>. `` All I can say is God bless you,'' <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON> said when asked for comment. At the Democratic Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, a similar `` kiss-in'' led to a shoving match between demonstrators and police. But a handful of the Big Easy's officers just stood and watched. `` That's what we are here _ easygoing,'' said Officer <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Temperature Increases: When, Where, How Severe?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists testifying before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agree the `` greenhouse effect'' assures the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is in for rising temperatures and ocean levels. They do n't agree on when, where and how severe. The greenhouse effect is caused by the emission of such gases as carbon dioxide and methane, trapping heat in the atmosphere. Scientists say steamy weather and crop losses are two of the problems people can expect in coming decades. Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., have pledged to make the greenhouse effect a legislative priority in Scientific testimony before the committee last week indicated the sharply opposing views being presented to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Do nothing until there is less scientific uncertainty, said policymakers from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration such as <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, associate undersecretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. Get moving now to reduce production of greenhouse gases, said people such as <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a climatologist from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, operation run by a consortium of universities. Greenhouse-effect gases come from a variety of sources: from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels, production of such chemicals as chlorofluorocarbons, the escape of huge amounts of methane from rice paddies and the release of carbon dioxide from the destruction of forests. Some scientists have cautioned that even if the world reduced its production of greenhouse gases, those already in the atmosphere mean that within 30 to 50 years the planet will have its highest temperatures in 10,000 years. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said more knowledge is needed before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> commits the nation to combatting the greenhouse effect through the type of program proposed in a comprehensive bill introduced by <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> and 16 colleagues. `` Significant gaps exist in our knowledge of the greenhouse effect _ gaps that must be filled if we are to address the concerns raised by potential climate change in a scientifically supportable manner,'' she said. `` These scientific uncertainties must be reduced before we commit the nation's economic future to drastic and potentially misplaced policy responses,'' she said. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, characterizing this position as `` political value judgments, not scientific opinions,'' said `` we should not use platitudes about scientific uncertainty as an excuse for inaction. ... There's a -LRB- scientific -RRB- concern that we are assaulting the environment much faster than we are understanding it. `` More research will certainly put policy-making on a firmer scientific basis ... but it is my opinion that credible details about specific ` winners and losers' will not be available before we may have committed ourselves to potentially dangerous, large atmospheric changes,'' he said. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> told lawmakers of greenhouse research in their agencies. They stopped short of seconding <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>'s stand that nothing should be done to combat greenhouse gas production until more scientific certainty is attained. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said `` high-leverage actions are long overdue.'' He called for steps that would combat greenhouse gases while attacking other environmental problems such as acid rain, low-level ozone pollution and destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons. He said his first priority would be greater energy efficiency and conservation to reduce emissions from power plants and vehicles. No step, he said, should be considered too small because slowing down the greenhouse effect `` makes good sense.''

<TEXT>
 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said today that he and running mate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> support continued development of a permanent manned space station as part of an `` all-out effort to restore <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leadership in exploring the universe.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, speaking after a visit to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spaceflight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had discussed the space station in a Sunday night telephone conversation and that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had promised `` an intensive review of the space station program in order to ensure the success of this important effort.'' `` We will stand behind an all-out effort to restore <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leadership in exploring the universe,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in the midday speech, which was made available to reporters beforehand. As part of that effort, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, that, if elected, he would create a Cabinet-level position to direct the nation's space program. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a statement that the space program `` suffers from a lack of a clearly defined purpose and ineffective top management ... our space policy is lost in a maze of bureaucratic committees.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came out for a permanent station in 1984. Under current plans, the $ 16 billion station is to be assembled in orbit beginning in 1995; more than $ 5 billion in contracts have been awarded. The House in June approved and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation authorizing spending of $ 902 million on the station in the next fiscal year. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, campaigning through <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is in his home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, recalled the early years of the space effort and said, `` One reason we overcame the initial Soviet lead in space was good organization and strong leadership.'' At that time, he said, a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet-level </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was established, chaired by the vice president. `` Unfortunately, the council was abolished by President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and -LRB- the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- administration vetoed an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to put in back in business,'' he said, adding: `` One of the reasons I accepted <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' offer to be on the ticket was the understanding he would give the vice president a major policy role in his administration. We agreed that in a Dukakis-Bentsen administration the space council would be reinstated and I would serve as chairman.'' The timing of the announcement in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> an opportunity to promise more jobs and more federal spending for his home state, which will be a major battleground in the fall campaign. `` My friends, that nails it down,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` There should be no doubt in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> or anywhere else in the world where a Dukakis-Bentsen administration will stand in space.'' From <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was scooting across the state line into <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> for a rally in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> and then returning to <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, for a rally. He spent Sunday resting with a visit to his father's home near <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Reporters were kept away, but <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said the major event was a gin rummy game won, as usual, by the 94-year-old <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> Sr. Besides recharging the 67-year-old senator's batteries, the stop underlined the campaign's effort to point out that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is a native Texan. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who receives the Republican nomination this week, claims <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as his home but was raised in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to join <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in the state later in the week, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> points out that before he was on the ticket the Republicans were cocky. `` They thought they had this state locked up,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> speaks confidently of winning <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, the city both he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have called home. `` I think we'll carry <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, sure do,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> once before, in the 1970 election that first put him in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He chuckled when reporters asked if he was concerned now that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was moving part of his national campaign organization to the state. `` No, it does n't worry me,'' he said. `` He's had his operations here before.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is running parallel campaigns for the vice presidency and for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. The dual candidacies are allowed under an unusual <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law.

<HEAD>Hirohito Marks Anniversary of End of World War II</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> told a ceremony marking the anniversary Monday of the end of World War II that his heart still hurts when he thinks of the victims of the war. In a national radio broadcast 43 years earlier, he urged the Japanese people to accept unconditional surrender to the Allies, following the atomic bombings of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>. It was the first time that most Japanese ever heard his voice. Now 87 and the world's longest reigning monarch, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> shuffled slowly Monday to the microphone in front of an altar decorated with thousands of white and yellow crysanthemums, but spoke in a firm voice. `` Today, on the day to honor the war dead and pray for peace, I think of those who died in battle in the last war and their bereaved families, and it still hurts my heart,'' he said. `` Time flies fast, and in the 43 years since the end of the war, the country has developed due to people's efforts. However, looking back on those days, I have quite profound feelings,'' he said. The emperor, the only major wartime leader still alive, underwent surgery last year so doctors could perform a bypass a growth in his pancreas. Since then, he has made few public appearances. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who also attended the government-sponsored ceremony at a large martial arts hall near the Imperial Palace, said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should learn from the `` noble sacrifice'' of those who died in the war, and pledged the country would do all it can to achieve world peace. About 7,000 people attended the ceremony, including relatives of war victims and Cabinet members. In cities around <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a variety of religious and citizens' groups held rallies against war and against visits by <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members to <ORGANIZATION> Yasukuni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shrine </ORGANIZATION>, a Shinto shrine in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> dedicated to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s war dead Among the 2.4 million war dead at the shrine, financed by the government until the end of World War II, are 14 major war criminals, including wartime Prime Minister <PERSON> Hideki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tojo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who plans to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> later this month, decided not to go to the shrine this year, although 11 of the 21 members of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> did, including Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Several hundred other members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also visited the shrine Monday, as did thousands of other Japanese, it said. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, stopped visiting Yasukuni after <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and other Asian countries that suffered under Japanese militarism criticized his official visit to it in 1985. The shrine was established in 1869 and was used by the military to promote patriotism and militarism during World War II.

Despite the suspension, the fraternity will recruit members during rush week, which begins Tuesday, on this campus where it was formed in 1856. It has 210,000 members nationally and many prominent alumni in this state. `` With this going on, who knows how many pledges we will have?'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithart </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION> attorney and SAE member who heads an alumni board set up to direct the chapter about 1 -LCB- years ago. Also on Tuesday, authorities have scheduled an arraignment for three of the four arrested: <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> <PERSON> Eskridge </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Prattville </LOCATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberds </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnette </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a junior from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The three were indicted on charges of selling cocaine, said District Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>. The case against a fourth student was closed after a grand jury refused to return an indictment. Two of the four were removed from the fraternity and two were suspended pending the outcome of the case, which includes allegations that at one point drugs were sold inside the fraternity house. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON>, national executive director of SAE, said each of the organization's 200 chapters is watching what happens to the 60-member <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> house. SAE has initiated more people than any of the 60 other national fraternities, and it ranks eighth in terms of the number of chapters. `` We are not holding our chapter accountable. These were individual arrests in individual cases,'' <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> said in a recent telephone interview from SAE headquarters in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brant </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interfraternity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said the entire world of Greek-letter organizations also would be interested in the outcome at a time when universities are struggling to define their role in regulating student organizations <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> said the conference is `` trying to get universities more involved'' in the governing of Greek organizations because of an apparent increase in the number of problems with alcohol abuse, drugs, hazing and racism. `` But many of these things are going on across campus, not just in fraternities and sororities,'' which have experienced a resurgence in popularity this decade, said <PERSON> Brant </PERSON>. Total undergraduate membership in fraternities nearly doubled from 230,000 in 1980 to 400,000 in 1985 after reaching a low of 157,000 in 1970. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> made it clear that SAE, despite former prominence, has what they consider to be a checkered past. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON>, director of student life, announced the suspension in June saying the move was based partly on what he called a `` history of repeated infractions.'' `` I hope that during this two-year suspension period all SAE alumni will work together toward the day when we will have a drug-free, hazing-free chapter of SAE at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> said at the time. Associate Law Dean <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> will hear the appeal of the suspension soon, university spokeswoman <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said last week, and university President <PERSON> Joab </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> wants to make a final decision on the appeal before he vacates the presidency Sept. 1 to return to teaching. <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON>'s statement mentioned a 1979 probation for hazing of pledges and a 1980 probation violation, a 1982 case in which the fraternity was convicted on six counts of violating the student conduct code and 1987 investigations by the university and SAE national that found a drug problem and extensive hazing in the chapter. Smithart and <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> do not deny past problems, but both maintain the group was caught in the trap of a vengeful college administration. `` We've got a whole new group of boys, and they are being blamed ... for things that happened while they were still in elementary school,'' said <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smithart </PERSON> said the fraternity has been doing better in many areas, including academics. Its grade-point average has moved from the middle of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s 28-fraternity pack to second, partly as a result of hiring a full-time academic counselor, he said. The chapter has proposed a drug-testing program for members, <PERSON> Smithart </PERSON> said, although he said he never believed there was widespread drug use in the chapter.

<HEAD>Convention Portraying Bush as War Hero, Family Man, Leader</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 War hero. Family man. National leader. If those phrases do n't bring to mind <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wait until Republican convention officials wind up four days of prime-time image building. `` I'm confident that when all is said and done with this convention, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are going to feel very good about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' says convention producer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> derides last month's Democratic convention as `` long on platitudes and short on substance'' and maintains his own production is not `` some sort of Madison Avenue job.'' Nevertheless, planners are leaving little to chance in their efforts to highlight what they say is the true nature of their standard-bearer. `` What people will see in their living rooms will be an individual who has very selflessly given of himself over many, many years in a variety of public service positions,'' said <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>. `` A very committed husband and father; an experienced public servant; a decorated war hero; and a loyal vice president who worked very hard behind the scenes to help create a lot of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> legacy.'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said there will be `` an entire host of speeches'' about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s life and career, including one Wednesday night in Spanish by his Mexican daughter-in-law. The speeches were honed to consistency with the convention themes. An early podium sample from <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> real estate magnate and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>: `` He's not only a war hero, he's a peace hero.'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s masterful media adviser, produced a film about the vice president scheduled for Thursday night. Expect to see lots of frolicking with the grandchildren, underscoring the family man theme. But do n't expect a camera tour of the 11-acre family vacation compound on the coast of southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Advisers reportedly were concerned about showing evidence of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wealth. Something else viewers wo n't see: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the near-mythical man from whose shadow he must emerge. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s farewell, with all of its attendant drama and emotion, will be long over as the spotlight shifts to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his family The first <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to mount the podium will be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the prospective nominee's 12-year-old grandson. He'll lead the Pledge of Allegiance on Tuesday. Young <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s parents _ Jeb and <PERSON> Columba </PERSON> <PERSON> Garnica </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guanajuato </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> _ will be speaking Wednesday. And later that night, during the roll call, son <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> will announce from his spot among fellow <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> delegates the 111 votes clinching the nomination for his father. `` To have his son of the same name put him over the top speaks about family and the commitment of our family to work hard for the person we love,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s five children are all convention delegates. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presence, a healthy 60 counting cousins, siblings and other relatives, culminates Thursday night with a speech by <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the candidate's wife of 43 years, the <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> film about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s acceptance speech. What will he say? `` What we are trying to do -LRB- in the speech -RRB- is have <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> define where he wants to take the country in the next four years,'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said. He called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plans `` very specific.'' The best-laid plans of convention organizers are still subject to the whims of the network television executives who determine whether anyone outside of cable viewers actually will see their careful orchestrations. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> film, slightly over 7 minutes long, is a key thematic element. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the network plans to show it all. The other two networks had n't yet decided. But even if the networks wreak havoc with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s master plan, that sturdy triad of family man, hero and leader, `` we wo n't be thwarted,'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said. `` The campaign begins in earnest after the convention, anyway. And those are obviously things that we'll be stressing beyond the convention.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Roman Catholics loyal to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and followers of rebel archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> organized competing processions Monday, each attracting about 5,000 faithful to renew <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 350-year-old vow of consecration to the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> Carrying statues and banners of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON>, and chanting `` Hail Marys'' _ the loyalist group in French, the traditionalists in Latin _ the two sets of marchers added color to downtown streets on the Assumption Day holiday, one of the quietest days of the year in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Parisians and tourists at sidewalk cafes turned to watch the processions and puffs of incense. This was the third year of dueling processions on Aug. 15, but the competition was sharpened this year by the recent schism and excommunication of <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> for consecrating bishops without permission from Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II. It also drew added attention because Monday was the 350th anniversary of King <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XIII </PERSON>'s vow of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s loyalty to the Virgin. It is celebrated on Assumption Day, which marks the day <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> was received into heaven. Cardinal <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustiger </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, led the official ceremony at Notre Dame Cathedral. Across the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the Latin Quarter, the traditionalist procession was led by Monsignor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tissier </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallerais </PERSON>, one of the four bishops <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> consecrated in a ceremony June 30 at Econe, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lefrebvre </PERSON> was excommunicated for going through with the consecrations without papal permission, creating the church's first schism in more than a century. `` Those who remain faithful to Monsignor <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> will stay in the path of grace,'' <PERSON> Tissier </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallerais </PERSON> said before the procession left the church of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nicolas </LOCATION> du Chardonnet. `` Those who do nor remain faithful will lose this grace.'' The 17th century church, in the ancient Latin Quarter a few short blocks from <LOCATION> Notre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dame </LOCATION>, has been occupied since 1977 by traditionalist worshipers and priests who follow <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> in rejecting such church reforms as Mass said in modern languages instead of Latin. <PERSON> Lustiger </PERSON> has taken steps recently to try to appeal to the traditionalists, including establishing the Assumption Day procession three years ago, following their example. He also said Mass in Latin at Notre Dame, and said the traditional Latin Mass would be used in three <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> churches each Sunday. `` It's an effort to co-opt people,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Baptiste </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaumeil </PERSON>, one of the marchers in the traditionalist procession. `` It shows a hypocrisy. The French bishops have always been against Monsignor <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and tried to make sure the negotiations with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> would fail.'' At the halfway point of their procession, at the ruins of the Roman arena of <LOCATION> Lutece </LOCATION>, there was a caged lion, which organizers said was intended to evoke the martyrdom of early Christians and symbolize the plight of <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s followers. Police estimated the traditionalist procession at about 5,000 people. Roughly the same number were gathered at the same time in late-afternoon sunshine in the square in front of Notre Dame Cathedral. Huge banners decorated the famous facade, including one multicolored representation of the Virgin holding the Christ child that was hung between the Western towers. Church officials said it reproduced a tapestry said to have hung in <LOCATION> Notre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dame </LOCATION> in 1638, when King Louis XIII dedicated the nation to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. Another banner reproduced the king's words: `` We believed ourselves obliged to consecrate our person and our state to the grandeur of God.'' The processions also were linked to ceremonies worldwide marking the end of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s Marian Year, a period designated by the pope for special devotion to the mother of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>.

 Despite her fear of flying, <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> is riding helicopters and small aircraft this week in a visit to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the gulf. It's not a new experience for the 70-year-old singer, who recalls doing her first show for servicemen in 1941, and has been among the professional entertainers on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> _ better known as the USO _ circuit ever since. `` The reason I do it is simple,'' she said. `` I tell'em that nobody promised them the bright lights of Broadway out here, but one thing we did promise them is that we would n't forget them _ and that's why I'm here.'' Miss <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and a five-member band headed by her husband, jazz drummer <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellson </PERSON>, performed Sunday and Monday for audiences aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Coronado </ORGANIZATION>, the flagship of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s 27-ship regional task force. Earlier, they performed aboard the aircraft carrier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> and the submarine tender <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> in the Arabian Sea. Miss <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, who starred in a Broadway production of `` Hello, Dolly'' in the 1960s, conceded that most of the sailors, whose average age is about 23, have only a vague idea of who she is. But she won a standing ovation for her show, which featured `` Chicago'' and `` The Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' a song that she said `` a voice told me to sing in every show I ever do.'' Afterward, despite the debilitating heat and an inflamed knee, she signed autographs for more than an hour. `` Most of them did n't know who she was, but now they do,'' said <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchins </PERSON>, a sailor from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` It was a great show. It's wonderful that she'd come out to the gulf and share her love for us.'' Men from the missile cruiser <PERSON> Halsey </PERSON>, moored alongside the <PERSON> Coronado </PERSON>, the missile frigate <PERSON> Vandegrift </PERSON> and several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mine sweepers also were present. For Monday's second performance, her last before returning home, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> invited officers and crew from two British ships, the frigate <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> and the mine sweeper <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON>. In addition to performing, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> is a member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Her USO tour, originally scheduled for June, was postponed after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship hit a mine. Miss <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said the USO, funded by contributions from foundations, corporations and other private sources, involves many visits to military hospitals as well as performing. Although the pace is grueling, she said more professional entertainers should visit what she called `` the far corners, the woods and places.'' She said she fears flying so much that at home, she either drives cross-country or takes <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> trains. `` A lot of people are gon na ask, ` How did the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> girl get out there?' Well, I'm good, but I do n't walk on water.''

<HEAD>Industry Output Up; So Are Inflation Worries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial production shot up 0.8 percent in July, the biggest increase in nine months, the government said Monday in a report which intensified economists' worries about rising inflationary pressures. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the large July advance was widespread throughout <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing industries and also reflected heavy demand for electricity during the summer heat wave. The 0.8 percent July advance was double the 0.4 percent June increase and marked the 10th consecutive month that industrial production has risen. It was the largest increase since a 1.1 percent rise last October. `` The economy has a tremendous head of steam,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It increasingly looks like an old-fashioned boom in the industrial sector with strong demand and production pressures bringing on inflation.'' Many economists had been expecting a strong July increase, given the fact the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> already had reported that manufacturing employment rose by 68,000 jobs in July, the largest increase this year. `` We are seeing an industrial sector that is surging under the impact of increased exports and higher capital spending,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON> said some of the strength in July was overstated, reflecting the increased electrical demand and some unwanted buildup in inventories. `` People ought not be frightened by these hefty industrial production numbers because the inventory buildup we have been seeing shows that there is still slack in the economy,'' he said. Other analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would likely read the new figures as further evidence of an overheated economy that needs to be cooled down by additional increases in interest rates. Last week, the central bank boosted its discount rate one-half percentage point to 6.5 percent. Raising the discount rate, the fee the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> charges for lending to commercial banks, is the most dramatic signal the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can send of its intent to fight inflation by dampening demand through higher interest rates. Many economists said they expect further <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening in upcoming weeks, especially in light of the strong industrial production figures. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is facing increasing evidence of more strength than desired in the economy,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer. `` This growth is too rapid at a time when we are nearly fully employed in the labor force and are running up against capacity restraints in many industries.'' The manufacturing sector has been the star of the economy this year as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> producers have enjoyed strong foreign sales brought on by a weaker dollar. The export boom has prompted a related surge in business investment to expand production facilities to meet the rising demand. Reflecting this increase, the industrial production report showed that output of business equipment increased 1 percent in July, continuing a trend that has pushed output in this sector up 9.7 percent above where it was a year ago, the fastest increase of any sector. The overall July increase came despite the fact that auto output actually fell. Autos were assembled at an annual rate of 7.1 million units, down from a pace of 7.5 million units in June. Production of light trucks also decreased during the month. Production of consumer goods was up 0.3 percent in July with gains in both appliance production and non-durable goods sectors. Output of construction supplies fell for the second consecutive month, dropping 0.3 percent following a 0.1 percent decline in June. The report blamed a strike in the lumber industry for the weakness. Overall, output by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers climbed 0.8 percent and now stands 5.6 percent higher than a year ago. In July, production of durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, and non-durable goods both rose 0.8 percent. Utility production climbed 0.6 percent following a huge 2.5 percent June increase with both months showing heavy demand for air conditioning. Output at the nation's mines, including oil - and gas-drilling activities, rose 0.6 percent in July This sector is now producing at a rate 4.9 percent higher than a year ago. Total output stood at 137.7 percent of its 1977 base of 100.

 A federal judge stepped down from the bench Monday to return to private legal practice, leaving fewer than a dozen black women among the nation's federal trial judges. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said she considered that statistic when deciding to leave the bench after nine years. `` One of the most pressing concerns I have is my race and my sex, because I know I have brought to the bench a different perspective,'' she said. `` The federal judiciary is an institution, and an institution should reflect society.'' However, she said: `` I think I've done all I can do here. For me, it's time to move on.'' A desire to return to private practice, rather than philosophical considerations, prompted her to leave the bench. `` I'm not so much leaving, but resuming what I did the years before I came here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. `` I want to practice quality law.'' But she also cited overloaded dockets and lack of support services as reasons for returning to private practice. She said budget cutbacks had left each federal judge in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> struggling to handle more than 1,000 cases without enough employeees or adequate computer systems to handle the work. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, now the Democrats' vice presidential nominee, recommended Mrs. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> for a federal judgeship when she was a lawyer handling employment discrimination cases. `` I feel very, very loyal to Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>,'' she said. `` For him to appoint me when I had a reputation for suing on behalf of minorities _ that took courage.'' Mrs. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> was sworn in May 31, 1979, whens she was 37, and became the first black and the third woman to assume a federal judgeship in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Her race came into play in several of her cases. The grand dragon of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 asked her to step aside in a lawsuit brought by Vietnamese shrimpers who claimed they were being harassed by <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> members. Mrs. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> refused the request, pointing out that the grand dragon had never heard her express a personal opinion about the Klan. Her race became an issue again when she presided over a dispute about attorneys' fees in a package of voting rights lawsuits brought against the city of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The suits eventually led to changes in the way the City Council is elected. The city asked her to step down from the case in 1984, saying that as a black she was a plaintiff in the class-action suits filed on behalf of Hispanic and black voters. Mrs. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> refused to bow out and her decision was upheld by the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the 5th Circuit had not affirmed, I expect I would have left the bench then; that's how important it was,'' she said. `` A decision not to affirm would have rendered me a second-class citizen.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> officials today refused to acknowledge the state violated federal election laws in its handling of absentee ballots, setting up a showdown in court against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. At issue is when the state's county clerks mailed out absentee ballots for Tuesday's primary elections. Some counties sent the ballots just 26 days before the election; the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> prefers that ballots be sent at least 30 days in advance. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> officials today said they refused to sign a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> stipulation saying they violated the law and agreeing to count any ballots received through Aug. 22, six days after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> primaries. `` We are not going to enter into a consent order,'' said <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpan </PERSON>. She said she expected the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to go into federal court later today to obtain a court order imposing the six-day extension. State officials believe fewer than 1,000 absentee ballots are at stake. <PERSON> Karpan </PERSON> and state Attorney General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said they do not believe the state violated any election laws. `` There is no set date in the statute that says -LRB- absentee ballots must be mailed -RRB- so many days -LRB- before a primary -RRB-,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Karpan </PERSON>. `` There are no rules and regs ... so we're not so sure that we're not in compliance.''

<HEAD>Ad Agency Loses State's Anti-Smoking Account Over Tobacco Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State health officials have canceled a $ 1.7 million contract with an ad agency to produce youth-oriented, no-smoking commercials because the agency merged with another which has a tobacco company account. The incident `` shows how long the tentacles of the tobacco industry are,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harty </PERSON>, manager of the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s section on nonsmoking and health. The Campbell-Mithun agency, based in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, recently merged with New York-based <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Esty </ORGANIZATION>, which has a $ 35 million account with <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Campbell-Mithun, which had a two-year contract with the state, developed and produced television and radio spots that have been broadcast regularly around the state since January One shows students falling over, domino-fashion, from the bad breath of a teen-age girl smoker. Another highlights the smelly odor left in smokers' clothes. The campaign, rather than focusing on long-term health risks of smoking, emphasized the lowered personal attractiveness and social isolation of the smoker. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> recently began airing animated public service ads with a similar tone, characterizing smokers as `` buttheads'' and pariahs. <PERSON> Harty </PERSON> said Friday that Campbell-Mithun would be replaced by the Martin-Williams agency of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> for at least two years. The contract with <PERSON> Campbell-Mithun </PERSON> had just been renewed when its merger with <ORGANIZATION> Esty </ORGANIZATION> was announced last month, she added. The Campbell-Mithun advertisements have been `` very effective,'' <PERSON> Harty </PERSON> said, based on measurements of audience reach and recall. <PERSON> Campbell-Mithun </PERSON> made deft use of the state's limited media-buying budget, obtaining a significant number of free spots along with those it bought, she said. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for what now is <ORGANIZATION> Campbell-Mithun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Esty </ORGANIZATION>, said the move `` was an extremely difficult decision to reach, but it was an amicable one. We remain very, very proud of the work we did.'' Esty and the former Campbell-Mithun agencies are owned by the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Williams </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the agency's projections indicate very little likelihood of landing a tobacco-linked `` Even if it should happen, we've made a commitment to -LRB- the Health Department's -RRB- section on nonsmoking,'' she said. `` We'd ask -LRB- the prospective client -RRB- to understand, but it they did n't we'd probably not pitch for their business.

<HEAD>Reagan a Hard Act to Follow, Really Loves His Job</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 No one can say that we'll never see the likes of him again, but <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be a hard act for any president to follow. The man actually enjoys the job. Other presidents pursued the office with equal ardor, but none has savored it the way <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> used to refer to the White House as `` that great white prison,'' yet he had the luxury in those safer times of taking a walk around the block. By contrast, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is swaddled in a germ-free cocoon and has n't seemed to mind. If he were to write a book, you can bet it wo n't be about the splendid misery of it all. That aura of comfort in the job invited a comment from delegate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, that you hear often around the Republican National Convention: `` I do n't think there's anybody here who would n't like to have <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the ticket again.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ and, for that matter, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ eat your heart out. Everything about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> shows his pleasure with the best role of his actor's life. It's in his body language. He bounds onstage for speeches; he looks interested in the other guy's speech; he laughs at every punch line. His wave to crowds is never forced. Amiability is his strong suit. He has turned his age to advantage with endless variations of the same one-liner. `` I always feel at home here in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> because, you know, I'm the fellow that talked <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> into buying it,'' he said at a rally welcoming him to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Sunday. It got a laugh; it always does. Where other presidents were renowned for their inability to make small talk _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> comes to mind _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is the kind of man you'd like at your dinner party. He is a natural quipster and never more so than on the day he was shot. As he was wheeled into the operating room, he told <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, `` Honey, I forgot to duck.'' To his doctors: `` Please tell me you're all Republicans.'' and, en route to the recovery room, `` All in all, I'd rather be in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>.'' Politics aside, Americans like a man like that. He is the movie cowboy blowing the smoke away from his gun barrel, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> striding across the shot-up deck of his destroyer, <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> finding humor in the serious business of politics. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a real war hero, but he's derided as the wimp. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s the tough guy who spent his war years making movies for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> developed a rapport with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people by extolling optimism in a dark time. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has taken pages out of FDR's book, ridiculing the malaise that <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> talked about. `` A New Beginning,'' was his campaign slogan in 1980. `` It's Morning in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' was the refrain in 1984. Who else could get away with the things <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> He and his wife speak freely of family values when their own family is torn. His reputation is that of a religious man, yet he seldom goes to church. He is caught red-handed with faulty facts, misstatements, admission of ignorance of his administration's doings and he walks away with head held high. It is, as Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said, a Teflon presidency where nothing sticks. Far from being a drawback, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s actor background has helped him mold public opinion. No matter what he says, it sounds good when he says it. Television is his medium. He handles it better than anyone since <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Used to taking orders from directors in his earlier career, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has surrounded himself with aides to whom he delegates much authority. That enables him to be what he said he would be, a 9-to-5 executive who does not take work home. He came in to the White House with solidly rooted ideas and it has been both an attribute and a flaw that he sticks with them no matter what. His off-the-cuff public statements often draw on the 3-by-5 cards he used during his political infancy in the 1960s and even before when he honed his conservative views as a company spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is the 40th American president, the first actor, the first divorced man, and the oldest ever. His administration was tainted by scandal, by the Iran-Contra affair, by budget deficits, by curtailment of programs. None of that necessarily will be stressed by history. What will be remembered is <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Second Fire In Three Days at Landmark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fire broke out Monday on the 51st floor of the Empire State Building, forcing dozens of office workers to evacuate the 102-story tower, and officials said the second blaze there in three days was suspicious. The blaze, which began in a batch of carpets discarded in a stairwell, produced heavy smoke but caused only minor damage to the landmark skyscraper. Firefighters doused the fire about a half hour after it began. Authorities declined to say why the fire was declared suspicious, but Fire Commissioner <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said the investigation would include why 10 rolled-up carpets were stashed in the stairwell. Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, the deputy borough commander who commanded fire forces at the scene in last Friday's fire as well as the one Monday, said he had found nothing to link the two blazes, department spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said. One woman in the building fell but declined medical treatment, and a second was removed to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with possible cardiac arrest. One firefighter was sent to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> for treatment of smoke inhalation and heat exhaustion. The temperature was about 94 and rising at the time of the fire, which was reported at 11:34 a.m. and extinguished at 12:12 p.m.. An off-duty firefighter visiting his brother discovered the fire and helped to put it out, <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said Between 50 to 100 tenants on the five floors of the tower's midsection, floors 51 through 56, were evacuated because of the smoke, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, a management spokesman for the building The Fire Department initially reported that the fire started in an electrical conduit in a 50th floor stairwell; later, the department attributed the cause to the burning carpets. On Friday, a fire broke out in an 86th floor shaftway. After it was brought under control, firefighters discovered that it had climbed up to the 102nd floor. The popular observation decks at both those levels had to be closed and some 1,500 tourists evacuated. In addition to forcing other evacuations because of smoke, the fire Friday interrupted broadcasting for several hours by eight FM radio stations whose antennae are atop the building.

 A feud between the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and the governing <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is proving to be an embarrassment to Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> as he campaigns for next month's general election. In the last week, the government's election worries have been compounded by an exchange of accusations with the secret police of mischief-making and political spying. The feud between the government and its counterintelligence arm, known as SAPO, goes back decades. But the tension resurfaced after book publisher and former journalist <PERSON> Ebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> launched his own investigation into the 1986 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>. It became clear the amateur detective, an insider in the governing party, was investigating <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION> as much as looking for the elusive killer. But critics said Social Democrats exceeded their authority and sidestepped official channels by ordering the secret investigation, which has overshadowed campaign issues such as taxes or the environment. Justice Minister <PERSON> Anna-Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> resigned last month after it was disclosed that she aided <PERSON> Ebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>'s efforts to contact British intelligence officials for the investigation. <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION> is a department within the regular police structure, and is responsible for ferreting out spies and protecting Cabinet ministers. Palme, who disliked the formalities of office, dismissed his <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION> bodyguards when he and his wife went to see a movie on the night he was killed. Prime Minister <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> _ not related to <PERSON> Ebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> _ told a parliamentary inquiry Aug. 4 that he backed the investigation because of `` important allegations and serious criticism against a Swedish authority.'' He was referring to charges that <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION> was negligent in protecting <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION> and tried to cover up its shortcomings in the hunt for the assassin. <PERSON> Ebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> told the inquiry earlier that <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION> had failed to act on a tip that <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s life was in danger. `` If it is not a conspiracy, it is stupidity,'' he told the televised hearing. In another slap at <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> told reporters that he trusted <PERSON> Ebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> more than he did <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s commanders `` Palme's murder was for many leading Social Democrats the final confirmation of <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s incompetance,'' said a report in the business weekly Affars Varlden. <PERSON> Holger </PERSON> <PERSON> Romander </PERSON>, a former police chief, was quoted as saying the <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> affair `` is part of a campaign against SAPO ... by people who distrust an organization they can not control and know little about.'' Social Democrats say <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION> is a bastion of conservative politics. Some party leaders are reported to back removal of <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION> from the police force so that it would report directly to the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Svenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION> urged the government to reject the credentials last year of a Soviet diplomat whom the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said was the new <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> station chief. The government ignored their advice. In a book published last week, former <ORGANIZATION> SAPO </ORGANIZATION> chief Per <PERSON> Gunnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinge </PERSON> wrote that the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> created a political intelligence agency during the late 1950s. The agency, called the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, enlisted personnel in military or research organizations to register political opinions of citizens to identify communist sympathizers, the book said. The activity went on until the early 1970s. The <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> story was first published in 1973, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> questioned the timing of the book's publication six weeks before the Sept. 18 election The dispute has helped the three opposition parties cooperate in their attempt to unseat the Social Democrats, who have governed <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> for 50 of the last 56 years.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, the patriarch of a media empire that he sold in 1986 to end a family squabble over control of the holdings, died Monday at age 82. The former owner and publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> had undergone treatment in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> hospitals since learning he had a brain tumor late last year. His doctor said <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> had been in a coma for the past nine days. <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>, whose newspapers won eight Pulitzer Prizes, sold the two papers in 1986 to <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which folded the Times into The <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION>. Many public figures praised <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>'s journalistic and financial contributions to <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. `` He was one of our commonwealth's treasures,'' said former Gov. A.B. `` Happy'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, who had his share of feuds with The <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION> during his half-century in public life. `` He was respected for his character, integrity, fair-mindedness and benevolence of spirit by those on every side of the controverisal issues of the day,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky. `` The tradition he established serves as a continuing memorial to his high sense of journalistic responsibility,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, president and publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION> Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>'s personal physician, said he was with <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> when he died at home at 5:15 a.m. `` He had a seizure last weekend, and we believed the tumor was growing again,'' the doctor said. <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> served as president and publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> from December 1937 until June 1971, when his son <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> took over the reins and he became board chairman. Since the sale of the media properties _ including the two papers, a TV station and a printing company, reportedly for $ 435.8 million _ <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> had exercised his influence through the <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> Sr.. Fund <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> and his wife established the philanthropic organization to support education, arts and health endeavors in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. It had distributed more than $ 8 million by late last year. One of the fund's largest gifts was $ 2.6 million for the construction of the 40-story <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fountain </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest floating fountain, which will be dedicated Friday <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> placed the media properties on the market in January 1986 after nearly two years of family infighting. He said he could n't find a solution that was fair to everyone. His illness came as he unsuccessfully fought the release of a controversial book about his father, Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Worth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>, who had acquired the newspapers in 1918 with a $ 5 million inheritance from his second wife. The book alleged that the elder <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> contributed to his second wife's death by failing to secure proper medical attention for her and by drugging her to try to persuade her to change her will. <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> dropped the book project after <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> supplied a 5-inch thick memorandum of what he contended were 160 misstatements of fact by author <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> issued the book in 1987 after making what it called insignificant changes. The Louisville-born <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> with honors in 1928, eventually abandoning his dream of becoming a novelist and joining the newspaper as a police reporter. He took control of the media empire in 1933 when President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> appointed his father ambassador to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Judge <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> had launched WHAS-AM radio in 1922 and later started <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION>, which prints Sunday magazine and advertising supplements. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> Sr. set up WHAS-TV in 1950; <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was involved in opening WAMZ-FM. Dissension within the family surfaced in 1984 when <PERSON> Sallie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> challenged the ability of her brother to serve as editor and publisher. <PERSON> Sallie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>, her sister <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and their mother were replaced on the board of directors by professional managers. <PERSON> Sallie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> then announced she was disposing of her 15 percent interest. That eventually led to <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>'s surprise announcement that he was dismantling the empire. In addition to his wife and three children, <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> is survived by nine grandchildren. Two other sons died in accidents, in 1964 and 1966. A funeral service is scheduled for Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Calvary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>.

 Two men have conquered the last unclimbed area of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> _ the treacherous northeast ridge _ but they failed to make it the last 1,000 feet to the 29,028-foot summit. `` It is the longest and hardest route on <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Brice </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Twizen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, completed their climb the weekend of Aug. 5-7. It has been 35 years since <PERSON> Everest </PERSON> was first climbed, yet this was the first to succeed in reaching the rocky pinnacle atop the knife-shaped northeast ridge, <PERSON> Brice </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> after returning from <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. `` We were both disappointed we did not reach the summit,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` But we feel proud we have climbed the unclimbed ridge ... -LRB- and -RRB- we are happy. It is a notable -LRB- climb -RRB- in the history of Everest.'' This was the fifth British <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> expedition to tackle the ridge. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had previously reached the 26,000-foot level on a 1986 expedition. The route was pioneered by British alpinist <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnington </PERSON> six years ago. Two of <PERSON> Bonnington </PERSON>'s British colleagues, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Boardman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tasker </PERSON>, never returned. <PERSON> Brice </PERSON>, 36, said their expedition established its advanced base camp where the ridge begins, at 21,000 feet in the east Rongbuk Glacier. Several members went on to Camp 3 at 26,000 feet, where the pinnacle starts. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 29, said they left <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> 3 early in the morning of Aug. 6 and climbed 14 hours to the pinnacle along the knife-edged ridge, which was strewn with many cornices. `` For the whole way, we had to knock off a foot and a half of snow before we could climb ... There was no place to stop and sit, so we could not drink or eat anything on that day.'' The two stopped climbing after dark and made a ledge to sit on for the night, in high winds and a heavy snowstorm. `` We could sleep only 10 to 15 minutes at a time because of the cold and lack of oxygen,'' <PERSON> Brice </PERSON> said. But, `` we were not worried ... not scared. We were confident of what we were doing.'' The next morning, the two climbed for a couple of hours and reached the top of the pinnacle at 28,000 feet. `` We stayed there for two hours hoping to go to the summit -LRB- of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Brice </PERSON> said. But `` the weather deteriorated _ from bad to the worse. The visibility was poor.'' Asked whether they could have reached the summit if they had pushed on, <PERSON> Brice </PERSON> replied: `` You ca n't beat the weather. If we had gone to the summit we could not have come back.''

 Forty-five years after <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> flew a daring World War II bombing mission from a remote Australian airfield, the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is going back _ this time as the leader of a congressional delegation celebrating the country's bicentennial `` For me it will be a sentimental journey,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, remembering the 17 hours spent flying over the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in a stripped-down B-24 and the midnight bombing of refineries at <LOCATION> Balikpapan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION>, where much of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s aviation fuel was being produced. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat was a 19-year-old second lieutenant in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> when he and Capt. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> flew the lead plane in the 2,700-mile mission and suprised the Japanese, who had left the lights on in the harbor at <LOCATION> Balikpapan </LOCATION> because they thought the refineries were beyond the range of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bombers. On this trip Down Under, he hopes to `` demonstrate to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> our appreciation for their steadfast friendship.'' A meeting with Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> is on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s itinerary, as the speaker, his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, and about a dozen members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and their spouses attend ceremonies to inaugurate the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the capital of <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> The delegation leaves Friday and returns to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Aug. 31, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who is organizing the bipartisan group at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. While in <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and the delegation will attend the first session of Parliament in the new building and meet with leaders of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and of the opposition party. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers will visit the Australian War Memorial and the Australian-American War Memorial, and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will lay a wreath on each. The Australian air force will fly <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON> air strip in the rugged Northern Territory, where he spent much of his combat tour. `` I'll go back for this sentimental journey,'' he said, reminiscing about the time as a young soldier he bought a wild horse from a nearby rancher for $ 48 and fed the animal with oats intended for his comrades' breakfast. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his valor in the bombing of the <LOCATION> Balikpapan </LOCATION> oil refineries, at the time the longest bombing mission on record. His plane was the first to arrive over the refineries and the lights immediately went out when he dropped his bombs.

<HEAD>Governor Seeks Review of Program That Allows Zaccaro to Live in

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> has asked for a review of a state corrections program that has allowed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to spend his four-month prison term for selling cocaine in a $ 1,500-a-month apartment. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Berney </PERSON>, a spokesman for the governor, said Monday <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> believes the overall program is outstanding but that she is concerned about inequities in living accommodations among participants. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, the son of former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, was convicted in April of selling a quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover officer while a student at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. He was sentenced to one to five years in prison, with all but four months suspended. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was deemed eligible for the state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s `` house arrest'' program, under which non-violent convicts can find their own housing while they remain under close supervision by corrections officials. The program is designed to ease prison overcrowding. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> is staying in a luxury apartment with room service and cable TV in a building designed for expense-account business people on short assignments. `` This guy is a drug felon and he's living in conditions that 99.9 percent of the people of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> could n't afford,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, who prosecuted the 24-year-old <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>. State corrections officials say they have no control over the quality of the living quarters. `` The department does n't provide the apartment,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, director of planning for corrections. `` The prisoner does that. We are only concerned that it meets minimum standards _ no drugs, no guns, no college kids hanging around. `` Obviously, some people, Mr. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> among them, have more money than others, and they can afford a better place. The <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> probably would n't think much of his apartment,'' he said. `` The governor believes poeple should be treated equally regardless of personal circumstances,'' so has asked for the review, said <PERSON> Berney </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> had no suggestions for solving the inequities. There are a host of problems in trying to regulate the standard of living quarters. For example, some of the participants live at home, raising the question of whether the state would force people from their homes if they seem too luxurious. <PERSON> Berney </PERSON> said it was important to remember <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> `` does not have freedom in any sense of the word. He works most of the time, and is restricted to his apartment for the rest of the time, with the exception of one hour a week in which he has to go grocery shopping.'' <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> works at a community youth center in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>. `` He gets a personal visit a day and two phone calls a day from an officer. He is very closely monitored,'' said <PERSON> Berney </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Stroessner Takes Oath of Office for Eighth Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> took the oath of office for an eighth time Monday in a subdued ceremony that followed weeks of tension between the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 75, was sworn in before the congress by the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Argana </PERSON>. He then quietly walked off the podium without speaking to assembled representatives and foreign dignitaries. The 25-minute ceremony was broadcast by state-run radio across this landlocked and mostly rural country of 3.8 million. Although there were no protests, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> canceled the annual Te Deum mass of thanksgiving traditionally celebrated on Aug. 15 to mark the anniversary of the founding of the capital, <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>. The cancellation, ordered by Monsignor <PERSON> Ismael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolon </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, was a response to the expulsion July 25 of a Spanish Jesuit priest for allegedly publicly encouraging overthrow of the government. The church denied the charge and said the priest, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, a 65-year-old professor, was explaining <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theology </ORGANIZATION>, a movement that advocates political change as a tool of social reform. The church, the most influential institution in the country after the government and the military, claimed in a message delivered from pulpits two weeks ago that it was the victim of persecution. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> during a visit here last May to relax restrictions on human rights and political freedom. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, also commander of <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s military, took power in a 1954 coup and has ruled with a heavy hand ever since. His tenure has brought order and modest economic growth to a country that had seen turmoil and 11 different presidents in the 19 years following the end of the Chaco War with <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> in 1935. But most civil liberties are curtailed and dissent is crushed. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> won an eighth term in February in an election marked by the absence of the major opposition groups, and by charges of fraud. He was credited with obtaining 88.6 percent of all votes cast. Monday's inauguration was witnessed by Brazilian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Abreu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondre </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON> and delegations from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Afterward, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> swore in his 11-member Cabinet. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Elpidio </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Saldivar </PERSON> as foreign minister.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will not tolerate more Pakistani aid to Moslem guerrillas in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, who increased pressure on the Soviet-sponsored government by capturing a district near <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital. Insurgent leader <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that guerrilla successes in the field may cause the Soviets to complete their troop withdrawal ahead of the Feb. 15 deadline. He said his forces had captured <PERSON> Shigal </PERSON>, a strategic post in <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> province near the Pakistani border. A Soviet government statement issued through the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> contained some of the sharpest language the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has aimed at <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` The Soviet government most resolutely declares that the continuation by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of its obstructionist policy vis-a-vis the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> can not be further tolerated,'' it said. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reserves for itself, in that case, the right to take such measures that are necessitated by the situation.'' It was not specific about the response. On May 15, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began withdrawing its estimated 115,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under an agreement signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as guarantors. Half the soldiers were to be out by Aug. 15, which the Soviets said Sunday had been achieved, and all are to be gone by Feb. 15. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> marked the occasion with an article in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda thanking the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for its help. With the article, Pravda printed a map showing the remaining Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> along two evacuation routes, from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Shindand </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> in the west. Soviet military officials said earlier the pullout had cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from 25 of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 30 provinces. The map showed soldiers in only a narrow ribbon through the remaining five provinces. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 31 civilians were killed and 113 wounded in 142 attacks on populated areas in the first 10 days of August. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> there are more than 180 guerrilla training centers in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and 50 bases for rearming rebels and storing weapons. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement calls for other countries not to interfere in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. Guerrilla groups were not parties to the accord. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, replaced one pro-Soviet government with another, and remained to fight the insurgents. More than 13,000 Soviet soldiers have been killed. Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978 and use Pakistani border camps and cities, where more than 3 million Afghan refugees live, as supply points and bases. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries have armed them through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Monday fighters from insurgent groups had captured the <LOCATION> Shakardar </LOCATION> district about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. It quoted reports in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> as saying they were armed with 1,500 rockets they intended to aim at the capital. Other guerrilla organizations planned to send large forces armed with `` long-range weapons, rockets and Stinger missiles'' from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Karabag </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pagman </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Sorubi </LOCATION> districts of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> province, the agency said. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, Soviet commander in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said Sunday that insurgents had captured <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, a northern provincial capital 40 miles from the Soviet border. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday, told a news conference that reports of the fall of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> were `` fabrication and misinformation.'' When told <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> announced it, <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said the general's statement was not `` authentic. `` What is authentic and reliable is the statements made by the government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Several days ago <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> faced a barbarous and ferocious attack,'' but insurgents could not be considered in control unless they established institutions such as schools and hospitals. `` The fact is that they do not have any kind of administration over there,'' he said. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said Monday soldiers had recaptured the city. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, said his information indicated fighting continued near <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> did not respond directly when asked whether there were circumstances under which the Soviets might stop withdrawing. He cited a joint statement issued Aug. 7 when Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> saying the two sides would `` draw the necessary conclusions and determine their actions'' if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> continued to aid the insurgents. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in an interview the same day, however, that the withdrawal would finish on schedule. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> claimed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had wanted to remove partial units from eastern, southern and southwestern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to make things easier for Afghan government forces, but that proved too dangerous so entire units have been withdrawn. `` The Soviets are not leaving because of a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement but because they see no gain,'' he said. `` They are forced to leave.''

 It was n't too long ago that they were a pack of bickering rivals, six would-be presidents sniping and squabbling in public over who could best lead the Republicans to victory in November. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was most often the target of the other five, who never hesitated to list his shortcomings. But all that is forgotten now, as <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> join the Republican convention this week in singing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s praises. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the undisputed star of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> unity fest, the other five are by no means shrinking violets during the week's activities Two are busily keeping themselves at the front of the vice presidential sweepstakes; three will be prominently featured in prime-time slots at the convention; and all five are making the rounds with delegate speeches, media interviews and receptions in their honor. Each of the former candidates was given a spot to address the convention hall, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Haig </ORGANIZATION> shortly after the opening gavel on Monday morning, and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the prized prime-time slots at evening sessions. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, in an eloquent version of the message he has been delivering since his dismal showing in the primaries, said the Democrats are looking to the policies of yesterday while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Republicans are the `` party willing to explore, examine and put new ideas to work.'' `` You have to feel a little wistful,'' the former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> governor said in an interview when asked about seeing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> receive the party's nomination. `` I love the process, I enjoyed what I was doing, I'd love to still be doing it. But <PERSON> George </PERSON> was a little stronger this year.'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, the former secretary of state who has served under seven presidents, said he will join <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s surrogate speaking team and `` do everything I can to get <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> elected president.'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, who often directed the most pointed barbs at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary debates, said in an interview Monday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is as well qualified a candidate as our party has ever put forward.'' `` We're in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to unify our party, to endorse our worthy nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he told the delegates Monday. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the senator from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman, meanwhile, have been dashing around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> campaign-style _ from breakfasts to receptions to luncheon speeches to interviews and TV shows. Both are said to be on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s short list as he deliberates who will be his running mate and both have said they would accept the job. At a breakfast sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> thanked his primary supporters. But he added, `` That's behind us and now we're on to the big event where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will become the 41st president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Wife <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> sounded as if she were promoting her husband for the second spot on the ticket, saying, `` I was very proud of the fact that literally a week after <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> withdrew from the presidential race he was out working hard, and I mean hard, for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He does n't look back.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, being pushed for the second spot by conservatives, has a full schedule. He's encouraging Republican enthusiasm for the party's conservative platform and attacking the Democratic ticket of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. But mostly, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is stirring up support for his own vice presidential ambitions, saying Monday that he `` could be a good second string quarterback for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the television evangelist who raised $ 25 million but failed to attract significant voter support, has set up a large campaign office near the French Quarter. But so far there seems to have been little activity in the office. Arriving in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> spoke party unity but insisted that the conservative views he espoused will be vindicated in the election this fall. `` We are getting ready to show why Republicans should be elected next fall and why <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should be the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is to address the convention Tuesday night, and will be honored at a rally afterward. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> announced last week that he would not enter his name into nomination, removing the last potential wave on the otherwise smooth convention waters.

<HEAD>Dukakis Dismisses Reagan Criticism; Says Leadership Is The True
`L' Word</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Monday dismissed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s criticism of him as a `` liberal, liberal, liberal,'' saying Republicans have turned their backs on basic <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values and that `` the ` L' word in this campaign is leadership.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, on his annual visit to the central part of his home state, said he was not fazed by criticism of him at the Republican National Convention and predicted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s personal popularity would not help certain <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` In the last analysis, people are going to be looking at me and Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and they are going to be looking at which one of us has the leadership,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters. He noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned actively for GOP <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates in 1986 but could not keep Democrats from regaining control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> talked with reporters after attending an event to mark the first phase in implementing the state's universal health care law, which guarantees health insurance to virtually all workers by 1990. On arriving in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` It's time to talk issues, to use the dreaded ` L' word. To say the policies of our opposition and the congressional leadership of his party are liberal, liberal, liberal.'' He also accused the Democrats of stealing the theme of family values that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said had helped fuel the Republican resurgence. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he does not think such criticism of him will cause lasting political damage. `` The ` L' word in this campaign is leadership,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` This is n't about the past. It's not about the'70s or the'30s. It's about the'90s. ... The ` L' word is leadership. That's why I'm running for president. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used the health-care event to tout his record as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor on issues that affect the family, citing his work to expand opportunities for day care and affordable housing as well. He called basic health care `` a birthright of every American'' and added: `` That's something the Republican party has never understood.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he could not provide a figure of how much such a program would cost on a national level but said he hoped most of it could be financed through minor increases in insurance premiums with the possibility of using government money to get the program rolling That is the case in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, where $ 65 million has been allocated for the first two years. At Monday's event with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were several disabled people who will get health insurance through the new program _ allowing several of them to work for the first time. The central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> trip is an annual event for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who will return to the region Tuesday. He recited his administration's efforts to bring the region back from an economic depression and said he was n't sure if he would be back next year. `` Fate will tell us in a little less than three months,'' he said. After the luncheon and health-care event, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> toured a metals factory in <LOCATION> Westboro </LOCATION> before returning home for the night. The governor issued a statement calling for a Cabinet-level council to oversee the nation's space program and said he would support deployment of a permanently manned space station. At the news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the startup money for the station _ which aides said would be about $ 900 million in the first year _ would be taken from cuts in some weapons programs and from more efficient Pentagon management. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> endorsed the space station for the first time as his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, toured the Johnson Space Flight Center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also continued to blame <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the increase in the prime interest rate to 10 percent, saying the higher lending rate resulted from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s continued `` borrowing and spending, borrowing and spending, borrowing and spending.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is scheduled to be in his home state through Wednesday, when he will begin a campaign trip to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 Cattle Numbers For Slaughter Market Rose Last Month <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as of Aug. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 6.84 million head, up 2 percent from a year ago and 8 percent more than inventories of two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last month was reported at 1.25 million head, down 2 percent from a year ago and down 10 percent from two years ago. Marketings of `` fed'' cattle in July totaled 1.77 million head, up 4 percent from a year ago and also up 4 percent from two years ago. Officials said those were the most July feedlot marketings since the seven-state estimates began in 1972. As of Aug. 1, feedlot inventories were larger than a year earlier in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> but were smaller in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The seven states produce about three-fourths of the nation's beef. State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Aug. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

 Lone wolf, maverick, member of an extremely small group of conservative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators _ <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> identifies with all those characterizations and says he does n't care as long as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is listening closely `` I run with a pretty small pack,'' the self-proclaimed and sole congressional spokesman for the Coalition for a Winning Ticket said late Sunday night. `` I did n't come here to blend in with the wallpaper. I'm going to compete within the bounds of civility up to the end to put forth my agenda.'' Thus far, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s effort to pressure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into naming a conservative running mate has attracted tremendous media coverage. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> planned it that way. `` If there were n't a news vacuum at this convention, we would n't really get the attention, but I saw the chance and, quite frankly, decided to exploit it,'' he said. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> acknowledges that all the noise wo n't win victory on the convention floor if he had to take it to a roll call vote. `` We'd be beaten,'' he said. So why fight <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign attempts to create harmony? `` We're trying to sensitize him and particularly his advisers.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> people are tone deaf. They are so isolated from the majority of the party.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, 47, a former airline pilot, narrowly defeated 16-year incumbent Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, a Democrat, in what was viewed as a major upset in 1978. It was <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s first try for public office. He promised to be the `` toughest skinflint in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Senate.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> has since carved a niche in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as the leading spokesman against abortion. He is a fiscal conservative, strongly anti-communist and an advocate for the freedom fighters in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` I do not try to be all things to all people,'' he says of his essentially unyielding positions. `` People either like the kind of representation I give them or they do n't.'' When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> named <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> as keynote speaker, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> threatened to stage a boycott unless <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> allowed an abortion opponent to speak. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> later announced he was satisfied with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's promise to let Congressman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to speak on the issue. `` I've made that -LRB- abortion -RRB- a real point of leadership,'' he said. `` That riles some people.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> also believes that many agree that the vice presidential nominee should be anti-abortion, fiscally conservative and strong on defense, but are afraid to speak out. `` If I was n't raising hell, who would be?'' he asked. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> says he does n't really want to force the convention to consider an alternative nominee, but he will try if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picks a moderate. Even in losing, an alternative nominee would be able to reassure conservatives `` the movement is still there and lives.'' `` As long as I do n't overplay my hand or become uncivil, I do n't see any downside for conservatives,'' he said `` Right now, we're shut out.

<HEAD>Polish Miners Stage Protest At Rudna Copper Mine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 300 miners Monday protested dangerous working conditions and the lockout of three Solidarity leaders at a copper mine. <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, a spokesman for the outlawed union, said workers staged a rally at the <LOCATION> Rudna </LOCATION> mine in southwestern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after managers failed to fulfill promises made after a strike in May. The workers also demanded that the Solidarity leaders _ members of a commission fighting for improved safety at the mine _ be allowed to return to work, <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said. The three men have not been fired, but were ordered to turn in their identity cards Saturday. The Rudna copper mine has been the scene of frequent unrest. Managers ended the strike in May by agreeing to improve safety, but failed to meet Monday's deadline for implementing the changes. <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said the miners planned another rally Tuesday. Solidarity activists say the miners are working in dangerously high temperatures with poor ventilation. Safety issues have not been addressed by the officially sanctioned trade union at <LOCATION> Rudna </LOCATION>. However, that group has pressed for higher pay. <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said the miners also demanded the right to form independent trade unions. Solidarity has been suppressed since 1981, when <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist leaders imposed martial law. It was banned by parliament the next year.

 They talk about plant closings _ we want to continue plant openings. They see <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in terms of its limits _ we see <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in terms of its possibilities. If we do our job right, I predict that by 1992 _ the start of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s second term _ one-quarter of our party will consist of black, Hispanic, and Asian-Americans, who will see in our party the best hope of a better life for themselves and their families. What's the real purpose of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution? It was n't to defeat Democrats. It was to bring new ideas and superior leadership, to restore confidence in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Like the American Revolution itself, the greatness of our revolution is measured, not by who we're against, but by what we're for. Last month in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> failed to say what they're for. All they said was who they're against They all said, `` We ca n't stand another eight years of Republican policies.'' Of course they ca n't. It's clear that <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ca n't stand another eight years of Republican policies: because that means another 5 million new employers _ and another 17 million new jobs. At that rate, all their constituents will become Republicans. This is no time to stop. This is no time to go back. We have a lot of work to do. We d n't just want low inflation _ we want no inflation. We do n't just want low unemployment _ we want no unemployment. We need a safety net to keep people from falling _ but we also need a ladder of opportunity upon which all can climb. We do n't just want to oppose communism _ we want to support men and women who are fighting for freedom and democracy, whether in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We want to free people, not only from too much dependence on government _ we want to free them from dependence on drugs, and the disrespect for human life. Mr. President, you've brought us to the threshold of a new era. In fact, you've taken us over the threshold. You've shown us that we can do more than contain our adversaries _ we can transcend them. You've shown us how we can make even the threat of nuclear war obsolete, through the now-proven technology of strategic defense. You've reminded us that the first and best <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> is a strong family. And you've shown us that the power of a right idea is the greatest force on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Mr. President, this is a powerful legacy that you are handing us here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. I just want you and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> to know that, under the able leadership of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, this party is going to take it and run with it. We're going to win in November. We're going to finish what we began in 1980: To help all Americans _ to help people everywhere _ to share in the success of freedom, democracy, and peace. Thank you, and God bless you.

 <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s high school buddy said Monday he has the King's first recording, a highly sought two-song disc <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> made for his mother in 1953. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a retired airline pilot, said in a telephone interview that <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> left the record at <ORGANIZATION> Leek </ORGANIZATION>'s grandmother's house in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> 25 years ago. `` I saw him a few years later in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, when he was first starting to make it, and I said, ` I still have that first record of yours. It's going to be worth a lot of money some day.''' Presley's reply, according to Leek: `` Just hold onto it.'' `` I've been telling my wife, ` What are we gon na do with it? All we've ever done it lock it away,''' <PERSON> Leek </PERSON> said. `` Now I'd like to find out what it's worth.'' <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> of Graceland, the Presley home and museum in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, said the museum had long `` kept an eye open'' for the record, which he described as `` probably the single most valuable record in record collecting. It's the first record of the man who pioneered rock' n roll.'' Presley's first recording led directly to his discovery, and one <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> expert describes it as `` extremely valuable.'' The disc's existence was reported in this week's edition of Goldmine magazine, a journal for record collectors. `` It sounds like early Presley, slow, romantic _ it's not rock' n' roll,'' according to <PERSON> Kit </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiefer </PERSON>, Goldmine managing editor, who said he had listened to tapes provided by Leek. `` The sound is n't CD quality, but it's surprisingly good. Asked if the magazine suspected a hoax, he said, `` I've heard a lot of Elvis imitators, and none of them go for the immature Elvis sound. Also, everything -LRB- Leek -RRB- said checks out.'' In 1953, Presley, an 18-year-old truck driver, wanted to make a record as a present for his mother. He went to the <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, paid $ 4 and _ accompanying himself on acoustic guitar _ sang two ballads: `` My Happiness'' and `` That's When Your Heartaches Begin.'' The studio was owned by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, which shared the premises. One of the employees liked Presley's disc and called him to <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' attention. The first disc was long known to have been made, but no one has been able to determine what happened to it, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. Leek said that for years he kept the Presley disc with his wife's records, and later placed it in a bank safety deposit box after they moved to Key Largo, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Leek said he will auction off the record if he can get a reasonable price He also hopes to sell what he said was an autographed copy of Presley's first Sun release, `` That's All Right -LRB- Mama -RRB-.'' Leek said he met <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> in 1945 when they shared a class in high school. He said <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> frequently visited <PERSON> Leek </PERSON>'s grandmother, who had a piano young Presley liked to play. Leek's grandmother expressed an interest in the record he'd made, and Presley brought it over and played it for her, <ORGANIZATION> Leek </ORGANIZATION> said. Presley forgot to take it with him when he left, <PERSON> Leek </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>OMB Concedes $1.2 Billion Error in Budget Deficit Estimate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 1.2 billion mathematical error by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in calculating the size of next year's federal deficit could spark a fight with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when lawmakers return to the capital next month The mistaken estimate, which under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law can not be rectified, is preventing the spending of $ 1.2 billion at a time when legislators are struggling to decide which among several competing spending bills they will pass. Among them are programs to combat drugs and to help the homeless and the hungry. The White House Office of Management and Budget is estimating that spending bills for fiscal 1989 passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> so far leave the government with a deficit of about $ 144.2 billion. Under the Gramm-Rudman law, if next year's deficit surpasses $ 146 billion, there will be automatic spending cuts of at least $ 10 billion. But <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> officials confirmed last week that they have pointed out to lawmakers that their estimate of the deficit was in error and should have been $ 143 billion. `` We do n't know,'' <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said when asked how the error occurred. Some Democrats, questioned last week, said that with increasing pressures to spend money on various programs, lawmakers may have to consider passing legislation that would free up the $ 1.2 billion. `` If it's an error and does not reflect in fact where we stand, it's an option that should be considered,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., who is expected to become chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> next year But in a prepared statement, administration budget director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said he would `` oppose any tinkering'' with the law `` for purposes that would increase the deficit.'' As the $ 1.1 trillion federal budget goes, $ 1.2 billion normally would barely register a tick. But with <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> calculating that the 1989 deficit is coming so close to the Gramm-Rudman target of $ 146 billion, every dollar counts. The bills lawmakers would like to pass _ or that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not yet signed into law _ would exceed $ 1.8 billion in spending. Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> analyzes the economy and federal spending and revenues several times annually, projecting how much red ink is likely in the coming fiscal year. If the final numbers show that the deficit will exceed a target set by the law _ it is $ 146 billion for next year _ spending is automatically cut by at least $ 10 billion. That is a scenario <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have desperately sought to avoid. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> first made the error when calculating the rate of spending in a foreign military sales program in an August 1987 deficit report. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> noticed the mistake soon afterward, and made a slight correction. But provisions in the Gramm-Rudman law prohibit <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> from making dramatic changes in its projections on how quickly money provided by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is actually spent by agencies. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wrote that provision to prevent the executive branch agency from using bogus estimates to clamp down on allowable spending. Yet another part of the Gramm-Rudman law forbids <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> from making any changes in its deficit projection this close to the new fiscal year, except for new programs enacted into law. Fiscal 1989 begins on Oct. 1. `` We're locked in by Gramm-Rudman,'' <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said. For legislation not yet enacted this year, the cost of a wide-ranging drug bill has not been officially estimated, but it is believed that its cost will exceed $ 1 billion. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> estimates that the trade bill would cost $ 400 million; hunger relief would cost $ 300 million; and welfare reform would cost $ 200 million to $ 500 million. In addition, a measure primarily devoted to emergency spending for 1988 also contains $ 100 million for 1989.

<HEAD>Convention Rules Committee Rejects Veep Roll Call</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A conservative group pushing for a roll call vote for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nomination lost one round Monday when a convention committee voted to scrap the time-consuming ritual to conserve television time. However, Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, chairman of the group calling itself the `` Coalition for a Winning Ticket,'' said that he was prepared to carry the fight to the convention floor, possibly putting up a rival candidate for vice president to keep the process open. `` Every dictator in history has wanted to make the trains run on time,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said at a news conference after his proposal died before the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>'s Rules Committee. `` There is no more foolish thing in politics than seeking to stifle dissent.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> has been outspoken in recent weeks in urging <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to choose a conservative as his vice presidential running mate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not said who he will ask to join him on the ticket. Now <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> and his group object to a rules change that would dispense with a state-by-state roll call vote on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nomination if only one candidate's name is placed in nomination. In effect, the rules change, if adopted by the entire convention, would allow delegates to vote only on whether the nomination should be made unanimous. <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, who proposed the change in the rules, said it is to let the party use prime-time television more productively. `` Are we going to take 45 minutes of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s valuable time and waste it on an uncontested nomination?'' <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> asked during the rules committee meeting. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, who is not a member of the committee, was allowed to speak to the panel. But when delegate <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> tried to bring <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s proposal up for a vote, he was ruled out of order. When the entire set of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rules came up for a vote, only one dissenting voice was heard. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said later that he would try to line up the five state delegations necessary under the rules to put another vice presidential candidate's name in nomination. He said he had nobody in particular in mind and refused to name which states he was targeting.

<HEAD>Americans Gather To Plan `Peace Walk' In Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 200 Americans from 30 states converged on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monday to prepare for a 2,000-mile `` peace walk'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to dramatize a call for ending the superpower arms race, organizers said. The walkers plan to fly to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Thursday and begin their march in <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> coast, on Saturday, said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Affeldt </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walk </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based peace group that has organized the project. The Americans are to be joined in <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION> by about 200 Soviet citizens, and the two groups plan to walk together back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, stopping first in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. The Americans are to fly back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sept. 15, <PERSON> Affeldt </PERSON> said. He said the Soviet government placed no restrictions on the walkers' activities, which will include visits to Soviet homes, public meetings on political and social topics and brief stops at Soviet farms to help with the harvest. <PERSON> Affeldt </PERSON> said the event would mark the largest number of Americans ever to travel together in a Soviet republic other than <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. Their ages range from pre-teens to mid-70s, he said. The aim of the walk, he said, was to improve understanding between <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens and erode the distrust that has helped perpetuate the arms race. `` We're being citizen diplomats, making our statement in as dramatic a way as possible,'' <PERSON> Affeldt </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The trip's costs are to be borne partly by the walkers and partly by <PERSON> Affeldt </PERSON>'s organization, which gets its money from private donations and grants, he said.

<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said Monday his order confining 650,000 Palestinians to their homes under a military curfew was a clear message that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was cracking down on protesters. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops shot and killed a Palestinian, bringing the Arab death toll in more than eight months of anti-Israeli violence to 245, according to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> figures. The around-the-clock curfew was imposed indefinitely on this seaside strip Sunday evening following a violent weekend in the occupied lands in which three Arabs died. Troops shot and wounded 25 people in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> on Sunday, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports. It was only the third time the army had sealed off the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since the uprising began Dec. 8. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the curfew, which kept about 50,000 Gazans away from jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, would be in effect `` as long as it is needed.'' Some Israeli sources speculated the move was related not to resurgent violence but to an effort to put economic pressure on the 650,000 residents of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters threw rocks at police and at an Israeli bus near the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, slightly injuring three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tourists, police said. An official at <ORGANIZATION> Hadassa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> identified the Americans as brother and sisters <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shoshana </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai </PERSON>. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the three teen-agers were released after treatment. He did not have their hometown. Scattered protests broke out Monday despite the curfew, and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> reports said two residents of the Jabaliya refugee camp on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were wounded in the legs by army gunfire. Reporters were allowed into the strip only with Israeli army escorts to tour with <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. `` We have delivered a clear-cut message ... that violence will be met by force,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said, standing in the road near the site where a firebomb hurled at a van Sunday burned six Israelis, one of them an 8-month-old infant. `` The population ... must realize that if they take the law into their own hands, throwing firebombs, stones and putting up roadblocks, this will lead nowhere and they will be the ones to suffer.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said earlier that soldiers had been ordered to `` shoot to hit'' anyone caught throwing a firebomb and that the homes of suspects would be torn down without right of appeal. <PERSON> Yigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaminetzky </PERSON>, the chief rabbi of Jewish settlers in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, called for tough measures to prevent further firebomb attacks, including clearing both sides of the road for 50 yards in both rural and built-up residential areas. During <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s tour Monday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths darted out from behind garbage dumpsters and brick walls to hurl rocks at a 12-car military convoy carrying reporters and military offixcials. The convoy stopped several times to chase away protesters, but no shots were fired. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Palestinians violating the curfew dropped a large rock on top of a van carrying an Israeli television crew, but no one was hurt. Protesters also set tires on fire in the middle of roads and scrawled slogans on walls. Most streets were deserted, but an Arab witness who spoke on condition of anonymity said soldiers forced some residents to whitewash graffiti or clear away debris. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the army would concentrate on breaking the power of autonomous Palestinian `` popular committees,'' which have been orchestrating protests at the neighborhood and village level. He attributed the unrest to a show of force by Moslem fundamentalists, who called for demonstrations to mark the start of the Islamic new year 1409. Palestinians traced the weekend protests to the arson deaths of two <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> workers who were trapped in a shed that was set on fire near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Police said Jewish extremists may have been involved. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, hospital officials said 21-year-old <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION> refugee camp was dead on arrival after being shot in the heart during overnight clashes. Troops shot an 18-year-old Palestinian in the right leg after youths threw rocks on soldiers in the old city marketplace, and a second 18-year-old was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet, <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> hospital officials said. Israeli officials expressed mixed reactions to suggestions from senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> that a `` completely new'' <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter might include recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the dovish <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, called for clarifications. `` Whoever wants negotiations should say so clearly. What has been said until now is a jigsaw puzzle,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told reporters. But a spokesman for right-wing Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> described <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>'s statements as `` verbal trickery.'' `` We have to watch what they do, not what they say,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded Monday he has a hard act to follow but hopes to leave his personal stamp on the Republican National Convention and `` not try to be a <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. There is only one.'' The vice president spent his last day here putting finishing touches on his acceptance speech and maintaining his silence on his choice of a running mate. He planned to watch <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s evening speech to the convention on television before flying to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Tuesday morning. As of late Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still had not made up his mind on a running mate, although was likely to do so Tuesday before his arrival in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. `` He's going to call the schedule the way he sees fit,'' she said. `` He knows that if he tells one person, it will leak.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still plans to announce his choice Thursday morning, although she would not rule out the possiblity that the announcement might be moved up to Wednesday night. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent two sessions on Monday working on a final draft of his acceptance speech with speechwriter <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> and was `` pretty well finished'' with it, Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. Making the rounds of morning television interview shows, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that while he had narrowed his choice of a running mate he still had not made the final decision, even in his own mind. Asked whether he expected to be compared with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show he felt such comparisons were inevitable `` because he's been a great president. He deserves tribute, not only of the Republican party but of a grateful nation. And so there will be some comparison of that nature.'' `` I'm not going to try to be a <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' he continued. `` There is only one. I want to be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> the `` pressure is mounting'' as he nears the time of nomination. But he also said that as `` an athlete,'' he'd been `` in pressure situations before, maybe none this intense. But, look, all I'll do is just stand up there and say what I believe about peace and what I believe in about prosperity.'' In an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I want to stand up there on Thursday, pay tribute to what we have done, and give the president plenty of credit for bringing this country to new heights, and then say what I, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, will do on peace and on keeping this recovery going until everybody benefits. `` So it's a big moment for me, the culmination of a lot of years in politics. But I do n't feel concerned about it. I've got to be what I am and I'm not going to be like someone else.'' On the subject of a vice presidential choice, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` I have not decided. And I probably will say when I have decided. But I'm going to continue with this appropriate plan, making a decision in private and then presenting it at the appropriate time.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he hoped to make maximum use of his family at the convention, including his five children, their spouses and his 10 grandchildren. `` I've always protected the privacy and the wonder of our family,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Morning News.'' But he added, `` I've had to lighten up and say to the world, I guess, through this convention, this is what makes me tick. `` I thought Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did a good job on that -LRB- showing off his family -RRB- at the Democratic convention. But we've got him outnumbered, we've got a stronger bench, and we've got a great family.''

 <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Republicans, gambling that Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> will be vindicated by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee investigation, voted Monday to elect him chairman of the state delegation to the Republican National Convention. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s election in a unanimous vote came at a rowdy caucus at which delegates were poised to elect <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> IV of <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, a leader of a faction dominated by supporters of former presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the television evangelist. Then, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Persons </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> lawyer nominated <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a born-again Christian with wide support among the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> faction. Frost withdrew and endorsed <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> faction, which won control of the delegation in the credentials fight, demonstrated its clout by beating back the faction led by party regulars in a series of procedural roll call votes. The selection of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> by party leaders came less than two months after the same <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials met privately to decide whether to launch their own investigation of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>. Those meetings were prompted by revelations about an on-going federal undercover investigation of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>. Tape recordings from the investigation, obtained by <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspapers, showed that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> had continued to pursue an $ 850,000 home construction loan after he was told it likely would be financed with drug money he would be helping to launder. The <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> GOP decided not to conduct its own investigation, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION>, launched a probe of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> in June to determine if he had violated the law or House rules. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who requested the ethics committee probe, apologized for his role in the loan negotiations at a news conference in June. He said he was wrong and ashamed but would continue to seek re-election.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> gave its final assent Monday to a `` conservative but ... compassionate'' platform and sent it to the full GOP national convention with only two dissenting votes. Most of the 106 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> shouted an enthusiastic approval to the 40,000-word document, which will be presented to the full convention Tuesday. Thhe only `` no'' votes were cast by <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s two platform committee members, Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Boatwright </PERSON>. After the voice vote, <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> demanded a show of hands but it was curtailed without a formal count after Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the co-chairman, looked at all the arms raised in support of the platform. There were no minority reports, which means there will be no debate on the convention floor Tuesday over any of the planks. The platform, `` An American Vision: For Our Children and Our Future,'' includes a firm pledge against tax increases, calls for `` rapid and certain deployment'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> and seeks a Constitutional amendment against abortion. It skewers the Democrats on ethics and promotes <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s positions in favor of a child-care tax credit and increased education spending <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON>, a co-chair of the panel, said, `` I think we have a platform here that's not only concervative but it's compassionate. It's compassionate because it's dealing with so many of the problems that are current in 1988 _ problems of the environment, of children, of health care, of building for a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Nebraksa Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, missed her final committee session to attend a luncheon honoring <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform is roughly eight times longer than the 5,200-word, streamlined document that the Democrats approved in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last month. Rep. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a co-chairman, said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> document was `` a substantive piece of work,'' unlike the Democrats' `` flight of fancy. <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> said afterwards, `` The Democrats gave us a little bit of an opening. It's kind of unusual that they decided to be so vague and almost kind of bragged about it. ... We have seen this as an opportunity to become the party in which ideas have consequences.'' `` This platform will be looked upon as a tool for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Republican candidates to run upon,'' <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> said he was against the platform both for `` what's in it ... -LRB- and -RRB- what's not in it.'' He said the document fell short on civil rights, AIDS, social justice and other issues, and `` we certainly do n't do any favors for women.'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, the most liberal <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senator, added, `` I'm against the Democratic platform because it did n't say anything, and I'm against the Republican platform because it says too much.'' <PERSON> Boatwright </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> national committeewoman from <LOCATION> Stonington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, stayed for the meeting despite an injury to her left leg caused by an escalator mishap. She said she was riding up an escalator at the Hilton Hotel `` and somebody dropped a whole bunch of boxes. They got stuck at the top of the escalator. And I could n't get off so I fell over them.'' She said the platform was `` a little bit more conservative than our constituency in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> feels.'' She delayed a trip to a hospital for stitches because `` I certainly did n't want my senator to vote alone.'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, who lost attempts last Wednesday to liberalize the platform's planks on abortion, AIDS and disability issues, said, `` It was a fair hearing. I took my licks and gave a few. That's the whole process in this country. So, I'm not complaining, but neither am I voting for it.''

<HEAD>US Deaths From AIDS Outnumber Those From Birth Defects</HEAD>

 AIDS claimed about 13,000 American lives last year, a toll that would have ranked it 15th among all causes of death, according to the first annual government statistical summary to include the disease. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome was added to the annual summary of disease starting in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The agency estimated that between 12,450 and 13,820 Americans died of AIDS last year. While AIDS was not officially added to the overall rankings of causes of death, that total would have put in 15th place, ahead of birth defects, which claimed 12,130 lives. For statistical purposes, AIDS has been listed in the category of `` other infectious and parasitic diseases,'' which accounted for 19,160 deaths in 1987, compared with 9,030 the year before. The report said 65 percent of AIDS victims were white males and 25 percent black males. White and black females each made up between 4 percent and 5 percent of the total. The age groups most heaving affected were 25 to 34 and 35 to 44, the study added. AIDS is a contagious, fatal disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections The disease is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from infected pregnant women to their offspring. The chief victims of AIDS have been homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers. Health officials estimate that heterosexual contact is responsible for 4 percent of cases and that between 1 million and 1.5 million Americans have been exposed to the virus. A person who tests positive for antibodies to the AIDS virus, an indication of exposure, has a 20 percent to 30 percent chance of developing AIDS over a five-year period, according to the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. As of Aug. 8, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,208 Americans, of whom more than half, or 39,620, have died since June 1, 1981, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

 Republican convention organizers say time pressures brought on by the mystery over <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate are forcing them to begin writing `` generic'' speeches for last-minute use by the person picked for the ticket. They conceded, however, that they'd leave some room for modification to fit whoever delivers the speech. `` By Wednesday morning ... we will have one or two writers working on a generic kind of acceptance speech which the nominee would then have to take and modify and put into his or her own style of words,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convention manager. By keeping the vice presidential selection the best-kept secret in the convention city, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adds pressure to organizers of the convention who are working hard to orchestrate even the tiniest detail for a good television showing. That includes editing and painstaking revision of every word in every speech delivered from the podium. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said those speechwriters want an early start on the vice presidential nominee's speech, because it will be a major focus of the convention's final night. `` It's a generic kind of a speech, it's a draft,'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said. `` The nominee will not learn of his or her selection until Thursday morning.'' Even with the head-start on the nominating speech, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said convention organizers will face a last-minute scramble to line up nominating speakers _ and write their speeches. `` We've got two other, three other addresses, really, to go along with it,'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said. `` They will be also in the same sequence. We'll have one or two writers working on an acceptance speech and another working on a nominating speech. `` We wo n't start this until Wednesday,'' he said. `` They will have no clues, nor will I, on who it's going to be. `` A good writer, with some general directions and general clues, can get a running start,'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said. `` We have n't selected yet who is going to give the nominating speeches, for the same reason,'' he said. `` We are developing some ideas of who are good speakers and could do it.'' Part of the problem, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said, is whoever nominates the vice presidential candidate must have some logical ties to the person selected and fit within the campaign theme selected by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` There's got to be some kind of a linkage,'' he said. This week's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> is a carefully scripted affair, and <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> clearly was n't comfortable with leaving major gaps in a schedule that's been developed over months of planning. `` We do n't have any choice,'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said. `` I think it's going to be all right, I think we have the caliber of people to do the nomination. I do n't have any great trepidations about that. Obviously they could do a better job with more time.''

<HEAD>Special Session To Levy $74 Million For Gulf Cease-fire Group</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> wants to levy $ 74 million from members to finance the military observers who will monitor the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war beginning Aug. 20, officials said Monday. The world body, which is in a financial crisis, gave details of the peacekeeping program for the first time in a published report Monday. It said more than 1,300 personnel will monitor the cease-fire and troop withdrawal in the 8-year-old conflict. The 159-member assembly scheduled emergency sessions Tuesday and Wednesday to arrange six-month financing for the operation. The report said about 350 of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring team will be unarmed military observers. An additional 615 will be military personnel, including 80 military police, 375 signal-communications personnel, 130 helicopter crew and maintenance personnel and 30 sailors. Another 350 will be civilian staff. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, its official name, was created last Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> after Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced that both sides agreed to observe a cease-fire starting Aug. 20. The belligerents will begin direct talks under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Aug. 25. About $ 47 million of the $ 74 million to be assessed is for start-up expenses. The 24-nation force could be extended after six months. Preparations also are under way to put together the first <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> naval force, which will patrol the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway and other sensitive areas. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, whose fees add up to a fourth of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget, is expected to be assessed about $ 23 million of the total cost for the peacekeeping force. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to donate extra money to the force, since they are wealthy and benefit from the war's end. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is in its worst financial crisis because of arrears by its members, especially the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> owes $ 467 million of $ 602 million in unpaid dues to the regular budget. It also owes $ 70 million in back dues for peacekeeping forces. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which promoted <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiations to end the Iran-Iraq war, has been withholding dues in an effort to compel the organization to institute budgetary reforms, cut personnel and improve efficiency. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said the organization faces insolvency next month if money is not forthcoming. About $ 44 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds has been approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for this year but not yet released. The nations contributing officers to monitor the cease-fire are <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is contributing a large signal corps. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force will require a large civilian contingent, including about 180 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> international staff and 160 local recruits. An advance group already is in the region and more soldiers will arrive this week. A report submitted Monday by the secretary-general said the levies from member nations would be paid into a special account to finance the force from Aug. 9 to next Feb. 8. Joint headquarters will be at both <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Slavko </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, will shuttle between the capitals. Detachment headquarters will be at <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Sector headquarters in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will be at forward locations at <LOCATION> Saqqez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>, Dezful and <LOCATION> Ahvaz </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Kirkut </LOCATION>, Ba-Qubah and <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report also calls for renting three 10-seat aircraft, one 50-seat plane, 12 helicopters and two patrol vessels. Rental of airplanes is estimated at $ 2.5 million, helicopters at $ 9.36 million and patrol boats at $ 1.38 million for six months. The group will purchase at least 13 categories of vehicles, from jeep-type vehicles to forklift trucks, for $ 6 million and will buy communications equipment for $ 5.57 million. Nations which contribute soldiers will pay their salaries, but the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> will pay for daily allowances and other costs. Cost of gasoline and oil is estimated at about $ 950,000, office furniture at $ 500,000, teleprinter equipment $ 78,000, medical treatment and evacuation of personnel $ 50,000, subscriptions to newspapers and periodicals $ 30,000, death and disability awards $ 400,000, uniform clothing, $ 300,000.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> warned <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on Monday against aiding Sikh insurgents in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, saying he did not want to take further action <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> `` might later regret.'' He spoke at celebrations of the 41st anniversary of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> Clashes in <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> state related to the celebrations injured at least 75 people, including 25 police officers, the Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said. In <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Popatlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarothia </PERSON>, a legislator of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was shot and killed Monday by a disgruntled party worker attending independence festivites, the news agency said <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said at a ceremony in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, `` We have taken firm action against -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- terrorism.'' He did not elaborate. He has often accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of arming and training Sikh rebels who are fighting for a separate homeland in northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, which borders <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has offered no proof and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has denied the charge. `` We do not wish to take action -LRB- <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> -RRB- might later regret,'' the prime minister said. He did not refer to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> by name, but said Sikh insurgents were getting help from across the border. On Sunday, Indian border guards shot and killed 11 Pakistanis as they tried to slip across the border into <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>, authorities said. Sikh radicals have waged a bloody six-year struggle in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, which has claimed about 1,700 lives this year. In <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> state adjoining <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, police fired in the air to disperse pro-Pakistani demonstrators objecting to independence celebrations, <ORGANIZATION> PTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said demonstrators burned a police jeep, threw stones at police and forced shops to close, with at least 75 people hurt. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was part of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> until 1947. Since their joint independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the two nations have fought each other in three wars. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> controls 30 percent of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>, but claims the entire state as its own. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> rejects the claim. At least 2,500 security officers were on duty as <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> delivered his Independence Day address at the 16th-century <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, according to a police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Guests, including Cabinet ministers and foreign diplomats, were frisked before the 40-minute ceremony and sharpshooters were posted on tall buildings around the sandstone fort. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, wearing white trousers and a tunic, unfurled the Indian flag on the ramparts of the fort to begin the festivities. He referred in his speech to the nearby island nation of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, where about 47,000 Indian soldiers are deployed to enforce a July 29, 1987, peace accord aimed at ending a five-year rebellion by Tamil insurgents. Tamil rebels returned to combat after a brief truce and are fighting Indian troops. `` We hope that the accord will be speedily implemented,'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said. A major reason for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s brokering the accord was that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has 60 million Tamils of its own, who are sympathetic to the Sri Lankan rebel cause. Tamils make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and claim discrimination by the majority Sinhalese population. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, is under heavy security after intelligence reports that a Tamil assassination squad entered the capital.

 Onetime presidential candidate <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> called on <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to become a Republican, saying Monday that he has no political future as a Democrat. `` May I suggest with all sincerity that the ground you seek is here, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, in the party of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>,'' du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said in an address to the Republican National Convention. Delegates applauded as du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> listed reasons he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was superior to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But when he said of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, `` We ask you to join us because we need you and you need us,'' the Superdome was silent. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was n't talking about it either; <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for him in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said he would have no comment. `` Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, you seek common ground, higher ground,'' du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said to the convention. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for expressing the `` most interesting thoughts'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> last month in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> did not mention any specifics. `` As long as your lungs have breath, yours will be a prominent voice,'' du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said. `` But as long as you speak as a Democrat, you will never be a successful leader.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> has formed committees to recruit blacks and other minorities to become Republicans, but the party remains predominantly white. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey found that 92 percent of the delegates to the national convention are white. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> mentioned the name of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> just twice. Using <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s keep-hope-alive slogan, he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` will not only keep hope alive, but he will make the dream of millions of Americans come true.'' <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, a former governor of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and an heir to the family's chemical empire, entered the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential race on Sept. 16, 1986, and dropped out last Feb. 18, two days after the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary.

<HEAD>Researcher Probes Using Hypnosis To Fight AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> researcher said Monday she is investigating whether hypnosis can help people with AIDS strengthen their immune systems, which the virus that produces the deadly disease destroys. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Olness </PERSON>, professor of pediatrics at the <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, said she is `` very optimistic'' that hypnosis eventually may play a role in battling acquired immune deficiency syndrome. AIDS undermines the body's disease-fighting immune system, rendering it vulnerable to various infections and forms of cancer. Ms. <PERSON> Olness </PERSON> said she is trying to find out whether some infections can be prevented or slowed. Hypnosis has been found effective in the treatment of less serious immune-related illnesses, such as warts, Ms. <PERSON> Olness </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. She was attending the 11th <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Hypnosis and <ORGANIZATION> Psychosomatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, a gathering of more than 600 medical and psychiatric experts. `` We are trying to find out which immune changes a human being can voluntarily affect'' under the influence of hypnosis, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Olness </PERSON> added that she had recently began an experiment involving about 50 hemophiliac children infected with the humane immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. Hemophiliacs are a major risk group for AIDS, which they contract through infected blood transfusions. Part of the group is being taught self-hypnosis techniques to see if they develop more antibodies against disease than the other children, Ms. <PERSON> Olness </PERSON> said. The patients, all aged 5 to 12, are shown a puppet show that explains the basics of the immune system. They then are hypnotized and given the suggestion that they can voluntarily increase production of certain antibodies, shesaid, and in later stages of the experiment they should be able to invoke the hypnotic state themselves. Her experiment's purpose is to boost boosting the function of T-cell lymphocytes, immune system cells that can help fight off AIDS infection. Mrs. <PERSON> Olness </PERSON> said her work was in line with a recent experiment in which a group of children showed significant increases of immunoglobulins _ immune system proteins _ in their saliva after undergoing hypnotic treatment. `` They were effectively increasing their antibodies'' just by being told to do so under hypnosis, she said. The experiment involved was conducted two years ago at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, according to Ms. <PERSON> Olness </PERSON>. A hypnotized person is made to concentrate on a particular image and enters an altered state of consciousness similiar to sleep. While that condition lasts, the patient is highly susceptible to suggestions that would otherwise seem strange or unacceptable. Conversely, the immune system can be severely weakened by adverse factors such as stress, Ms. <PERSON> Olness </PERSON> said, adding that little is known about the exact relationship between a person's emotional state and the body's resistance to disease. She acknowledged that the experiment, scheduled to last for two years, may be too short for lasting conclusions. Not all HIV carriers ultimately develop AIDS, and it may take several years for symptoms to appear in those who do. Use of hypnosis in fighting immune-related disease is among the most recent applications of the practice, which became popular in the late 18th century through the work of the Austrian physician <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesmer </PERSON>. AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
 A high-ranking <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomat arrived at the secret <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site on Monday as the countdown continued to Wednesday's historic joint U.S.-Soviet nuclear weapons test. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON>, who headed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation during the arms control talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, was taken to the remote desert site 65 miles from <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, where final preparations are under way for a test that will mark a milestone in the atomic age. Palenykh's arrival was not announced in advance. The nuclear test, known officially as the Joint Verification Experiment, comes nearly four years after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> first proposed such a project in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. It is designed to measure each country's ability to monitor the size of the other's test. Verification could lead to ratification of treaties limiting the size of nuclear tests, which were signed in 1974 and 1976 but never ratified. Scientists from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be measuring the explosive punch of a thermonuclear device encased in a steel canister buried 2,050 feet beneath a picturesque mesa. The canister, painted red, white and blue, is 8 feet tall, 88 inches in diameter, and weighs 7 -LCB- tons. Soviet scientists were allowed to look at the canister, but only after the nuclear device had been sealed inside. While the test will measure the size of a blast, it is not directly related to a possible test ban. However, scientists and diplomats say Wednesday's experiment is a crucial first step. <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON>'s counterpart at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, is scheduled to arrive at the test site this week. `` The weather looks good and from a technical standpoint, everything's in place,'' West said Monday afternoon. `` We're just making last minute checks and double-checks. Both sides want to make sure it goes like clockwork.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who helped forge the historic agreement, called the test unprecedented and said it was the result of a `` breakthrough in negotiations'' between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The test will mark the first time nuclear scientists from either country have been allowed on the other's highly sensitive test sites. As many as 45 Soviets will be on the secret <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site to monitor Wednesday's blast, scheduled for 1 p.m. EDT. A like number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists, who conduct nuclear testing programs for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, will be on hand for a Soviet test at <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> sometime next month. On Wednesday, the two superpowers will be testing their own monitoring systems. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be using a system known as CORRTEX _ continuous reflectometry for radius versus time experiment _ which determines the yield of a nuclear explosion by measuring the shock waves from the blast. The Soviets will be testing similar systems to see if they obtain the same data. The data for both sides will be recorded in trailers hundreds of yards from the blast site. No one will be allowed with 15 miles, except for helicopters monitoring the site with television cameras. Soviet and American scientists, along with selected reporters, will monitor the blast from a control point 30 miles away. Systems to measure the size of an explosion are considered a key in ratifying the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. Both limit nuclear tests to 150 kilotons and both sides have accused the other of exceeding those limits. The Soviet scientists are based at Mercury, a tiny community on the remote desert test site. They are allowed to move around at will in Mercury, but are taken under escort to all other areas of the secret site.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said Monday her government will enact laws prohibiting banks from handling funds of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and other terrorist groups. It will be illegal for banks and other financial institutions, accountants and financial advisers to handle such funds and the government will be empowered to seize the assets of convicted terrorists, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also said her government plans to put a special force in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to combat extortion and fund-raising rackets run by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> group trying to drive <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from the province, and rival Protestant organizations. She outlined her plans in a letter to the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, a lawmaker from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s largest Protestant party, the Official Unionists, who had accused the government of inadequate efforts against the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and other outlawed organizations. The <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> passed legislation in 1985 enabling the government to seize money suspected of belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, which also is outlawed in the republic. Convention obliges Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to withhold details of planned legislation until <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> presents the government's program at the opening of Parliament in November A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, said eliminating the distinctive car license plates issued to British soldiers serving in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will not protect them from guerrilla attacks. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> MacManus </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>'s national chairman, said in a statement the proposal was only a `` cosmetic exercise.'' Calls for a change in the distinctive license plates were renewed after the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> killed a British soldier driving in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> on Friday. `` Changing British soldiers' car license plates wo n't protect them from <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> attacks while their army continues to occupy part of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s national territory,'' <PERSON> MacManus </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Tracing Sexual, Drug Partners of AIDS-Infected People Called
Premature</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

 Health officials are premature in embracing programs to trace sexual and needle-sharing partners of people infected with the AIDS virus, researchers said Monday. Such programs are required by the federal government as a condition of grants to states for AIDS programs. But there is little evidence such programs curb the spread of the virus, the researchers said at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In response, a government public health expert defended the programs as a way to get education to people a high risk of infection. `` We have to try and make education work,'' said <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Havlak </PERSON> of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome can be spread by sex or sharing of needles used to inject drugs. One goal of notification is to limit the spread of infection, by uncovering people who do not realize they carry the virus and persuading them to act accordingly. But evidence is lacking that notification affects virus spread, said <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejowski </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. So it is premature to adopt widespread notification, he said. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Havlak </PERSON> said that while the brief counseling that surrounds a notification will not be enough to make a person change his behavior, that counseling is `` only the beginning.'' Long-term counseling and support are needed to bring about behavior change, he said. Many parts of the country have yet to develop such programs, he added. <PERSON> Dejowski </PERSON> also said the workings of some notification programs raise questions about the rights of notified people. One city's notifiers ask to draw blood for a test from the person at the time he is notified, he said. The contacted person, having just heard `` overwhelming'' information from a stranger, may not be able to properly consider that request, <PERSON> Dejowski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Havlak </PERSON> called the point arguable, but said the notifiers offer on-the-spot testing only as an option. Distraught people are offered crisis intervention help rather than being forced to decide on the blood test, he said. <PERSON> Dejowski </PERSON> also criticized pending federal legislation that would make states and local governments allow notification of spouses to be done by medical personnel. Such notification lacks the control and accountability of programs by public agencies, he said. And there is no guarantee that a doctor, nurse or other medical professional would have the training and sensitivity to deliver the news properly, he said. <PERSON> Havlak </PERSON> said he knows of no state that now prevents doctors from doing such notifications. Doctors can get help from state health departments if they wish, he said.

<TEXT>
 Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> said Monday the Sandinista government and U.S.-supported rebels are preparing for more war after several failed attempts at talking peace. During the news program <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pensamiento </LOCATION> on privately owned <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> prelate referred to a broadcast in which a leader of the rebels, known as Contras, said they never will abandon their fight against the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. `` I heard a few moments ago something resembling the Roman saying that ` if you want peace, prepare for war,' and it seems both sides are preparing for war,'' <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, said. `` That would be deplorable because those who pay the price for it are the youths who are dying. `` I have always said dialogue should be the solution, but it seems clear a propitious climate for dialogue does n't exist at this moment. `` God willing the government and the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- resistance will adopt flexible positions. These inflexible positions only produce death, destruction and the country's ruin,'' he said. Contras and their civilian supporters have been fleeing to neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> as supplies dwindle for lack of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds, but rebel leader <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said on clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> the fight will continue. `` If we want peace, we should prepare ourselves for war,'' <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said at a ceremony inducting 600 new guerrillas into Contra ranks at a camp in southern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> carried parts of the ceremony. `` We will not abandon the struggle until we achieve democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said. `` We will lay down our weapons only in exchange for democracy ... -LRB- otherwise -RRB- the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> people will declare us guilty of writing one of the blackest chapters in our country's history.'' `` We will not return to the negotiating table until the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are ready to talk seriously,'' he said, referring to President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s call last week for resumption of the stalled peace talks. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, a hard liner, was elected last month to the seven-member directorate of the Contra umbrella organization Nicaraguan Resistance. Contra and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> representatives signed a cease-fire agreement March 23 that has been extended but often violated. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> last extended it unilaterally for 30 days until Aug. 31. Efforts to negotiate a permanent truce have been deadlocked. The Contras insist the Sandinistas introduce democratic reforms before they lay down their arms, but the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> demand the rebels stop fighting and join the legal opposition. Contra negotiators broke off the last meeting in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, saying the government confined them to their hotel and did not allow them to meet with opposition leaders. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> proposed another meeting Aug. 27-29 in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Contras demanded a site elsewhere in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, preferably <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, and that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> lead the government delegation. The Sandinistas have not responded. Last week, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> revived the issue of an international verification commission provided for in a Central American peace plan of Aug. 7, 1987, and said it should operate on the Nicaragua-Honduras border to keep Contras and Sandinista troops apart. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> agreed, but on Monday the rebels objected. Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>: `` The Nicaraguan Resistance is present throughout <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> ... so if you are going to get an international force to guarantee a security zone, it will be necessary to have an international force that will guarantee all of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as a security zone.''

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> is likely to concur with the minor disciplinary recommendations contained in an investigative report on the shootdown of an Iranian airliner by the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, defense officials said Monday. The report, in its current form, recommends the light penalty of a `` non-punitive letter of censure'' for the guided-missile cruiser's operations officer, said the officials, who insisted on anonymity. That officer, so far not identified, would be reprimanded for his role in misinterpreting radar data and leading the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' skipper, Capt <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, to believe that the ship was about to be attacked by an Iranian fighter. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> and other crew members would not face any disciplinary action, even though investigators concluded the Iranian airliner was shot down primarily through human error aboard the ship, the sources said. All 290 people aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> A-300 Airbus died in the July 3 incident. Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, the chairman of the joint chiefs, received the investigative report a week ago and will forward the document to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> soon, the sources said. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> has the prerogative of changing the report's recommendations before they are presented to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, `` but that does n't look like it's going to happen,'' said one official `` It's hard, because 290 people died. But the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was on a wartime footing and just coming out of combat when this happened. No system is perfect in war,'' the official said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, as the final reviewing authority, may accept or reject <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>'s findings. The recommendation that only one officer be disciplined in the incident was first reported Sunday by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which said the operations officer faced a letter of reprimand. However, defense officials said Monday that the recommendation involved a non-punitive letter of censure, which is a lighter penalty than a letter of reprimand because it wo n't become an official part of the officer's service record. The sources also said the special board of inquiry that investigated the incident had not originally recommended any disciplinary action at all. The recommendation for a letter of censure was inserted by Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, the head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command, before he forwarded the report to <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, the sources said. Two weeks ago, defense officials disclosed the board of inquiry _ headed by Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> _ had concluded the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> attacked and destroyed the Airbus because of human mistakes made under the stress of combat. Because of the mistakes, Capt. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> believed his ship had survived its first combat action with Iranian gunboats only to confront an approaching, `` hostile'' Iranian F-14 jet fighter, the sources said. There was no evidence the Aegis radar system aboard the cruiser malfunctioned or that it presented technical data to justify the `` hostile'' classification, the sources added.

 A Soviet historian says the goals of the Czechoslovak reforms Soviet tanks crushed 20 years ago were similar to those now pursued by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. L.S. <PERSON> Yagodovsky </PERSON>'s article in the latest issue of the weekly journal <ORGANIZATION> Arguments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facts </ORGANIZATION> contrasted dramatically with previous characterizations of the the `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> spring'' led by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, which ended with a Soviet-led invasion Aug. 21, 1968. As recently as January, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said comparisons with current Soviet reforms were the work of Western propaganda. <PERSON> Yagodovsky </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of the Economy of the World Socialist System, used such <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> words as `` restructuring,'' `` glasnost,'' `` self-management,'' and `` self-financing'' to describe the Czechoslovak reforms. Reforms adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1965 `` coincide with the basic principles of today's transformation in this area in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, as with the conception of economic reform existing at this time in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other socialist countries,'' he said in the Aug. 13-19 edition of the journal. He said <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, then the Soviet leader, was more sympathethic to conservative opponents, and in the end reformers let the situation get out of control. <PERSON> Yagodovsky </PERSON> quoted party documents that said no way existed to restore order in the country except to invite the invasion. He said conservatives backed by party chief <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Novotny </PERSON> blocked the reforms and they could not succeed without `` perestroika of the form and methods of party work, without democratization of society, affirmation of glasnost -LRB- openness -RRB-, without giving socialism genuine human lines.'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Novotny </PERSON> as party leader in January 1968, and in March <PERSON> Ludvik </PERSON> <PERSON> Svoboda </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Novotny </PERSON> as president. Further reforms put in place in January and April 1968 `` opened the way for normalization of the situation, uniting the leading forces in a platform of renewal,'' <PERSON> Yagodovsky </PERSON> said, but <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and other party leaders did not take advantage of it. `` One of the main reasons, in my view, is that despite the rearrangement in the government, unity in the Presidium of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and in the party as a whole, was not guaranteed,'' he said. All top officials wanted reforms but did not agree on what the reforms meant, he said. `` Anti-socialist forces'' inside and outside <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> became more active and the situation in the country deteriorated sharply, he said. <PERSON> Yagodovsky </PERSON> quoted Czechoslovak party documents as saying the party was paralyzed, the government on the brink of decay and there was no choice but to bring in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact force to restore order. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was replaced as Czechoslovak party leader in April 1969 by <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who retired last year after running one of the Soviet bloc's more conservative organizations for nearly a generation.

 <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Stassen </PERSON> wound down his eighth fruitless presidential campaign Monday with the claim that `` I've always had something to say'' during his 40-year quest for the White House `` The fascinating thing about this year,'' the 81-year-old <PERSON> Stassen </PERSON> said in an interview as the Republican National Convention began here, `` is I came in very late saying -LRB- that -RRB- none of the other 14 candidates were saying anything about children. `` I said we needed a new American children's program, we needed it urgently.

 An experimental Roman Catholic parish that offered extensive lay participation such as planning the liturgy went out of official existence Monday, but its members vowed to carry on. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Corley </PERSON>, a lay trustee of the Genesis Community, said the 13-year-old group would continue in some form despite <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelineau </PERSON>'s decision to disband it as a formal church-sanctioned group. `` After today, the bishop has told us that we can not have a priest and a Eucharist celebrated on Sunday morning,'' <PERSON> Corley </PERSON> said. `` We will be following the bishop's directive over the next 40 days. We will not get together as a community for Eucharist celebration on Sunday morning.'' The group will meet on Sunday nights for `` prayer, reflection and discussion'' and will decide at the end of the 40 days where to proceed, <PERSON> Corley </PERSON> said. Last month, <PERSON> Gelineau </PERSON>, who created the Genesis Community 13 years ago, announced it would be dissolved after a task force he commissioned found it beset with `` erroneous attitudes'' concerning church teaching. <PERSON> Corley </PERSON> said the group was consulting canon lawyers to see whether <PERSON> Gelineau </PERSON>'s decision could be appealed. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not think an appeal was possible. `` They're an experimental open worship community that was a creation of the diocese, so it's strictly a diocesan internal matter,'' <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said. `` My understanding is that their only appeal would be to the bishop,'' he said. `` I do n't think there's any provision where they could go over his head _ to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, for example.'' The Genesis Community, unlike most Catholic parishes, was open to <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> regardless of where in the state they lived. <PERSON> Corley </PERSON> said it was distinguished by the role lay people played in `` sitting down with the priest, planning liturgy, social justice concerns.'' Conflicts between the group and its most recent priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Scagnelli </PERSON>, led <PERSON> Gelineau </PERSON> to commission the task force that recommended ending the experiment. <PERSON> Corley </PERSON> said the conflicts included whether leavened or unleavened bread would be used during the Eucharist ceremony and whether lay people as well as priests could read from the Gospel or deliver homilies. He said the community gave in to <PERSON> Scagnelli </PERSON> on each of those issues, but with each concession, some members became more and more disturbed. Some members said the degree of lay participation was what drew them to Genesis and warned that the church's resistance to the idea would be self-defeating. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is not the cathedral. It's not the clergy. It's us. It's the people,'' said member <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>. `` I ca n't see myself going back to the parish I left 13 years ago.''

 Vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> used a visit to the Johnson Space Flight Center Monday to announce the Democratic ticket will support building a permanent manned space station. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator, long a supporter of the space program, said presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> now endorses the permanent station, and `` that nails it down.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, issued his endorsement in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and said he would pay for the station by cutting some weapons programs and requiring tighter <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> management. A Dukakis-Bentsen administration `` will support an all-out effort to restore <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leadership in exploring the universe,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. Although President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is a long-time supporter of the space station, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the administration has mismanaged the space effort. If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is elected president, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, he as vice president would be put in charge of a reconstituted Cabinet-level space council. <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> headed the space council when he was vice president. But the board was later abolished by President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has killed recent efforts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to put it back in operation, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s previous silence on the question of the space station has created worries in states with large <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> installations, including <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Although <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has authorized $ 902 million for starting the project next year, the next president will have the option of withholding $ 515 million of that, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s statement `` makes you breathe a little easier,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Trebes </PERSON>, manager of the space station mockup at the Johnson center. `` Now, we're on our tippytoes, worrying if we'll be around next year.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, following his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> luncheon, denied <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s announcement represents a conversion. `` I think he was wise to have insisted on counsel ... before making any decision,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters, adding that he was one of those consulted by the presidential nominee. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who accompanied <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s decision `` an extremeley important announcement'' for the campaign in some hotly contested states that have space facilities. `` It'll help him in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. Although <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been supportive, he said, `` the president did n't mention it in his last State of the Union address. I think it's a huge issue.'' Before making his speech, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> climbed into a Space Shuttle mockup at the space center and chatted with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> -LRB- Hoot -RRB- <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, a Shuttle pilot. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> sat in the command seat and compared the controls with those he used as a B-24 pilot during World War II. `` I can look at a lot of things and have a great deal of familiarity,'' he said. `` Some of the instruments are n't that far apart'' from those in older aircraft, he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> visited the space center during a nine-day campaign swing that will be spent almost entirely in his home state, where he is running both for the vice presidency and for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is scheduled to join <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> at the end of the week for campaign stops and a visit to the LBJ Ranch. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> made a quick trip to <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, Monday afternoon for a rally with his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleagues from that neighboring state, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>. About 400 supporters cheered them on in a blazing-hot office building courtyard, as they praised the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket and blasted the Republicans convening in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` I have never seen a crowd so out of touch with reality,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, his shirt soaked with sweat, told the crowd. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> had lost 3,700 manufacturing jobs during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` And they're trying to tell you it's never been better,'' he said. `` I think we may be playing for all the marbles this time,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> then headed back to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for appearances Tuesday in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>.

 A second request for clemency for convicted rapist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was made Monday to Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, citing new high-tech tests <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s attorney says support <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s recantation and prove his client's innocence `` beyond a doubt. `` This is a case where a person was arrested, convicted and sentenced for a crime that never occurred,'' said <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> had served six years of a 25 - to 50-year sentence following his 1979 rape conviction when Mrs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> stepped forward to say she had lied when she said he raped her, in order to cover up a teen-age sexual liaison <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who received results of the test last week, is in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for the Republican National Convention. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnich </PERSON>, the governor's legal counsel, said before <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> makes a decision on the clemency `` he wants to talk to some scientific types, to feel comfortable in his own mind whether this test is scientifically reliable beyond a reasonable doubt.'' <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, meanwhile, remained behind bars Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Joliet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, serving the last day of a six-month prison term for failing to call his parole officer immediately after <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> granted him a `` last chance'' release from prison Dec. 24. Testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> waited until Dec. 26 to call his parole officer. Later that day, he was arrested in a bar for allegedly starting a fight over a sandwich. That was only one of a number of scrapes with the law <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> has had since May 1985, when <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> commuted his sentence on the original rape conviction to the six years <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> had already served. In commuting his sentence, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> bypassed <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s request for clemency, saying he did not believe <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s recantation nor <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s denials. Since that 1985 release, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, 30, has been in jail several times, convicted of drunken-driving charges and arrested for allegedly punching his wife and threatening the couple's infant daughter. Under the good-behavior terms of <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s `` last-chance'' order, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> will remain under parole supervision for three years and will undergo treatment for an admitted drinking problem. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> will be released Tuesday into an intensive residential treatment program for `` an unspecified period of time'' and will continue to receive out-patient counseling for his alcohol problem, said <PERSON> Nic </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> suggested Monday that <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s run-ins with the law may have stemmed from his original imprisonment, and that recent tests performed by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> forensic serologist prove `` conclusively, absolutely and definitively that <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> did not have sex with <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>.'' Results of the test, which involve DNA analysis of blood and semen samples from <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> and her former boyfriend, were turned over to <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> by <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s staff. Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, who performed the tests, said in a telephone interview Monday from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area that the test `` demonstrates that the semen in <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s panties did not come from <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, but was compatible with that of her boyfriend.'' He said results of the test, called Polymerase Chain Reaction, were submitted in one criminal case in which he testified in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state courts and were not legally challenged by either prosecutors or the defense. He said he was uncertain whether <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> courts would allow test results to be submitted as evidence. The actual clemency request <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> made Monday is submitted to the prison review board, which makes a recommendation and passes the request on to the governor.

 Demonstrators sought to disrupt a rally for evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and focus attention on the homeless and AIDS as the Republican National Convention got under way Monday. Police said six demonstrators were arrested outside the hotel where the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> rally was underway. While most rallies were peaceful, a shoving match broke out near a fence outside the Superdome, the convention site, when some of about 50 people protesting federal policy on acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, tried to push their way past. No one was arrested. Before they arrived at the Superdome, protesters gave brief speeches calling for more government support for social and medical programs for AIDS victims. Then they lay down on the steps of city hall for what they called a `` die-in.'' At <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, about six blocks from city hall and the Superdome, officials had set up a small stage and sound system for demonstrators to reserve 90-minute slots. The stage was empty much of the day. One of the speakers, Na'im Dai-Y, head of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless, said more attention should be paid to the issues which prompted the demonstrations. Protest organizers have lamented about light turnouts at several events. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Beal </PERSON>, 41, a demonstrator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said many groups are complacent about the fall elections. `` There's no turnout because everybody thinks <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a goner. He's behind in the polls,'' <PERSON> Beal </PERSON> said. The climate is another factor with both parties' conventions held in the South this summer. It's difficult to `` persuade people to go from one hot place to another hot place,'' <PERSON> Beal </PERSON> said. Daytime temperature in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> have been in the 90s. Similar conditions prevailed at the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last month.

 Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates paraded their wares at the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> national convention Monday as the coordinator of their drive to regain control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> said none of them will ever be `` outhustled'' by their Democratic opponents. Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, predicted the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> will regain control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in November because of good organization, good candidates, good financing and a series of `` surprises,'' although he acknowleged that at the moment `` 12 to 15 seats can still go either way. Thirty-two <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats are at risk this fall. The Republicans hold 17 of those seats, the Democrats have 15. <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> was optimistic. `` We think the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> can regain control of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1988,'' he said. `` We think it's in the realm of reason no matter how you look at it. These are good candidates. None of them is going to be outhustled.'' He predicted that the Republicans will take five of the six states left open by retirements. He acknowleged that Republican candidates are behind in some states. But he added: `` We think a number of these guys are going to pull through.'' Democrats won conntrol of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and now hold it with a majority of 54-46. <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> introduced the candidates at a news conference and allotted 60 seconds of exposure to each of 16 candidates. Many took longer than that. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, minority leader of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> State <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, reported that her name identification is up from 15 percent to 65 percent. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> said that he has raised $ 5 million in his race against Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, and is looking to raise another $ 2 million. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, a black former ambassador, said he will defeat veteran Democrat <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> and demonstrate that `` we can split any bloc and take any vote.'' Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, R-Neb., who said his first poll showed a name recognition factor of 1 percent, said he has pulled to a 44-44 deadheat with his opponent Rep. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., said he has achieved `` momentum'' in his drive to replace Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>, D-Miss., who is <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer, said that he is introducing `` one new positive issue a week'' in his drive to defeat Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, whom he accused of absenting himself from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to write books.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said Monday that during a visit to <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> he expressed concern about human rights violations and asked the region's government to lift restrictions on foreign journalists and other travelers. Ambassador <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Doje </PERSON> <PERSON> Cering </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Tibet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION>, that `` if they want to have informed reporting they ought to let in journalists as well as anyone else.'' Lord visited the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> and the city of <LOCATION> Xigaze </LOCATION> Aug. 4-10. He was the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to visit the remote western region. <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, ruled by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, has been closed to all but a few selected foreign reporters since pro-independence riots in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> last fall and again in March. <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> had been trying to build a tourist industry, but it also banned individual travelers, permitting only organized group tours, after the violence. Fourteen foreign reporters who went to <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> to cover the October riots were expelled from <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said <PERSON> Doje </PERSON> <PERSON> Cering </PERSON> `` seemed responsive.'' He did not elaborate. The ambassador said that in his two-hour meeting with <PERSON> Doje </PERSON> <PERSON> Cering </PERSON> he also brought up the issues of human rights and the status of prisoners detained after the disturbances. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> accused the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of interfering in its internal affairs after the passage of several congressional resolutions last year calling for an end to human rights violations in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said <PERSON> Doje </PERSON> <PERSON> Cering </PERSON> told him that the human rights situation has improved in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> since the Chinese Communists ended the theocracy headed by the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, the spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism. <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> came under <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military and political control in 1950-51. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> after a failed nationalist revolt in 1959 and <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> was made an autonomous region of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1965. Lord noted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recognizes <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s sovereignty over the region. The anti-Chinese demonstrations in October 1987 and last March were led by Tibetan monks loyal to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>. They accuse the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government of undermining Tibetan social and religious customs. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said <PERSON> Doje </PERSON> <PERSON> Cering </PERSON> told him that only 25 or 26 of the more than 200 people detained after the March rioting remained in prison, and eight of those still jailed were <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks or nuns. It is beleved several dozen people were killed during the violence in March. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said he asked permission for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official to visit a jail but there was no immediate response.

<HEAD>Police Chief Rescinds Order To Stop Black Youths</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The police chief Monday yielded to pressure from civil rights leaders and rescinded a policy requiring officers to randomly stop black youths in a racially mixed neighborhood. Chief <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> issued an order July 8 that police stop and question groups of black teen-agers in what he called an effort to end racial violence in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` The procedure was implemented to address a series of crimes that had been committed,'' <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> said in a statement Monday afternoon. `` Unfortunately, the focus of the directive has been perceived as racially motivated instead of the intent of focusing on the suspects involved.'' The statement apparently was issued to clarify reports earlier Monday that <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> had just dropped the word `` black'' from his directive. The statement said he had rescinded the order and directed his officers to return to normal procedures of stopping people only if police believe reasonable cause exists. <PERSON> Felker </PERSON>'s decision followed meetings with the president of the Toledo chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People, city officials and neighborhood residents. A group of black lawyers hailed <PERSON> Felker </PERSON>'s decision but said a $ 1 million federal lawsuit against the city would not be withdrawn. `` The suit will continue, and we expect more plaintiffs to join us. The policy was patently racist,'' said <PERSON> Lafayette </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolliver </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Thurgood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The group filed the lawsuit Friday on behalf of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a black teen-ager who was followed and stopped by police in front of his house but never charged with a crime. The lawsuit said the policy violates the constitutional protections against illegal search and seizure. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> rejected the group's request for a temporary restraining order after learning <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> had rescinded his directive. Blacks make up about 17 percent of the city's population of 340,000.

 Republicans ridiculed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from the opening bell of their 34th national convention Monday as they rallied behind <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s come-from-behind quest for the White House. Delegates reached out for a final, emotional embrace with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> viewed the proceedings from afar, saying he had n't settled on a vice presidential partner for the fall campaign. But that did n't stop the rumor mill _ or the jockeying by Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and the others interested in the post. Party chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> had hardly pounded the opening gavel at the Superdome podium when a parade of speakers began thumping the Democrats. `` Americans know that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will trash them,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s one-time rival in the primary campaign. He dismissed the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate as a `` diminutive clerk from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>'' in a speech that drew a disclaimer from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. `` Your party has lost its way, our party has found the way,'' former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said in an appeal aimed at Democrats. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convention city arrival was set for Tuesday. But he had no trouble making his presence felt, from his round of morning television interviews to the notice to the news media that eight of his 10 grandchildren would be visiting the city zoo. Outside the vast Superdome, six demonstrators were arrested at a rally for evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, one of several of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vanquished primary campaign rivals FOLLOWING EMBARGOED FOR 9:30 p.m. EDT

 Inside the convention hall, the Republicans were praising the man who twice led them to victory and declaring that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would pilot the party to greater heights. In remarks prepared for delivery, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> likened <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> for giving the `` whole world a birth of freedom.'' He said, `` Mr. President, this is a powerful legacy that you are handing us ... I just want you and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> to know that under the able leadership of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, this party is going to take it and run with it.''

 It was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last full day in the spotlight at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convention, complete with an affectionate birthday party tribute to his wife `` In front of all our friends here today, let me say thank you for all you do, thank you for your love and thank you for just being you,'' he said. Said the first lady: `` We have had a wonderful run, but today it is time for the Bushes to step into the political leading roles and for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> to step into the wings.'' Republicans hoped that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s turn at center stage would dramatically improve his standing against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Most polls indicate the vice president trailing, and a new <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll gave the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor a double-digit advantage. The vice president told interviewers that he had n't settled on a partner for the fall campaign, and hinted that some surprise names were still on his private list. `` Nice try,'' was his non-informative reply when one interviewer tried to penetrate the secrecy. If there was no news about his pick, there was no shortage of interest. `` We're trying to get <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to put a recorder under the vice president's pillow,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairwoman in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Many of the contenders were in town for the convention and related caucuses and receptions, some of them practically auditioning for the job and others professing bewilderment that they even figured in the speculation. `` If I were to be asked, I would be a terrific campaigner, and a terrific candidate and a terrific vice president,'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. `` We're not running,'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> insisted as his wife and co-contender <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> sat at his side. But `` when the phone rings she says, ` Well, let me get it,''' he teased. But former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader and White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` I've no desire to be vice president.'' Quipped Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, `` They ca n't possibly call me now, I have an unlisted number.'' Convention organizers passed the word that they would soon assign aides to draft `` generic speeches'' for use by the person <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ultimately selects. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he felt the `` pressure mounting'' as his big moment approached. `` But I do n't feel concerned about it. I have to be what I am'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Monday he would be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate if asked, but that `` from a personal standpoint'' he would n't choose to run for national office this year. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, said to be on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s short list of prospective vice presidential nominees, said he has reservations about his candidacy's effect on his family. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, is married and has three children. `` From a personal standpoint, if I had a time in my life to be vice president, I would n't choose this time,'' he said. But, he added: `` If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thinks I can offer the most to the ticket ... <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will sign up immediately.'' His wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, also said she has reservations about `` the total lack of privacy.'' Whether her husband gets the nomination or not `` it's fine,'' she said. `` I'm not panting after it.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said his 14-year-old son, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, is fascinated by the prospect of his father running for vice president. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s 11-year-old son, is ambiguous, his father said, and 9-year-old <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON> does n't like the idea of her father spending more time away from home. `` She told me, ` Daddy, I really hope <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picks <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>,''' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I said, ` It may happen.''' In case he is selected, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has begun to think about an acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention. `` I have n't sat down to write. I think that would be bad luck,'' he said. `` But I do have some ideas.''

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of people turned the funeral for three-time President <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> into a huge but peaceful anti-government demonstration Monday. It was one of the largest demonstrations in 14 months of protests against the rule of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who commands <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and controls the civilian government. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> was elected three times and overthrown each time by the military. He died Wednesday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who would would have been 87 Monday, spent more time in jail and exile than in office but was credited with founding <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s social security system and introducing women's suffrage. A vast crowd gathered in the plaza in front of the Metropolitan Cathedral for the funeral that was conducted from the church steps. As the service ended and the coffin was placed aboard a firetruck a roar went up from the crowd, with the people repeatedly shouting `` Justice!'' Thousands of people followed the cortege out of the plaza, through the narrow streets of the old section of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and onto Central Avenue, for the three-mile journey to a cemetery. With each block te procession became longer until people filled the four-lane avenue for nearly a mile. `` Arnulfo president, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> criminal!'' people in the crowd shouted. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go.'' Many people waved white banners, a sign of protest in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, or the flags of political parties opposed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> who was indicted by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last February on charges of narcotics trafficking. The government offered to provide military honors at the funeral but the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> founded in 1935, refused. Instead, the party decided on the requiem Mass conducted on the cathedral steps by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic archbishop. `` We ca n't accept that those who always overthrew the doctor -LRB- <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> -RRB- share in our grief,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Artola </PERSON>, party vice president. `` The ceremony is going to be for the people.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s soldiers and police, who have crushed dozens of protests in the past 14 months, did not interfere with the funeral despite the anti-government tone. Firefighters helped control the cathedral crowd and one of their bright orange ladder trucks carried the flag-draped coffin to the Garden of Peace cemetery. All sides in this politically divided country claimed <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> as their own. Government-controlled newspapers referred vaguely to his `` errors'' during 57 years in politics, but praised his nationalism and defiance of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and his daughter, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, were among the mourners Monday. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> was first turned out of office by a military coup July 14, 1941, after serving 9 -LCB- months of a four-year term. In January of that year, he had rejected a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> request for land for military bases along the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Soon after <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> was deposed at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s urging, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> provided 37,000 acres for the bases. He was elected again in 1949 but tossed out by the army in 1951. He began his third elected term Oct. 1, 1968, but was overthrown 11 days later in a coup led by Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> replaced as head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces. Four years ago <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> ran for president again and lost to <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardito </PERSON> <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s candidate, in an election widely viewed as fraudulent. The government said <PERSON> Ardito </PERSON> <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON> won by 1,713 votes. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> died of a heart attack. He had gone to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for medical treatment last April and remained there until his death.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> began meeting opposition leaders Monday to form a new political party opposed to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, whom he accused of incompetence. Laurel met with Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, members of ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and other opposition groups at the Club Pilipino, where Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took her oath as president on Feb. 25, 1986. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said at a news conference later that more meetings would be held to unite the opposition and seek Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s ouster. `` We are just starting the evolution to unify the political parties,'' said <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, the only opposition member in the 23-seat <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` Maybe then the administration will know there is a quiet opposition strong enough to make a challenge.'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said Saturday that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had failed to provide strong leadership in the face of the country's communist rebellion and in other economic and social crises. He urged her to step down and call new elections, and promised to resign himself if she did. If she refused, he would stay in office and join the opposition, <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> told reporters Monday he had not received a reply from Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and could not say when he would formally announce an alliance with the opposition. `` I do not want to pressure Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>,'' he added. `` The moment it becomes obvious that she will not be stepping down, I will be a free agent.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has not commented directly on <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>'s call. But she accused the vice president Saturday of withholding public support during coup attempts in 1986 and in August 1987. Asked the president's reaction to <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>'s meeting Monday with the opposition, spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> as saying: `` I was under the impression they were together all along.'' Sen. <PERSON> Sotero </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON>, the vice president's brother, told the upper house he would remain with the administration, saying `` there is no reason for me to dissociate myself from the coalition.'' Previous opposition attempts to form a united political alliance have faltered, mainly due to personal rivalries. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s supporters rolled up landslides in congressional elections in May 1987 Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ran under the banner of <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in February 1986 elections that led to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' ouster after 20 years in power. <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers reported recently that 21 of 22 members of that party were defecting to pro-Aquino parties. Many members left the party last year. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, fired as defense minister in November 1986 after a coup attempt by his followers, said the opposition would stick to constitutional methods and not attempt a coup. Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> declined 5.92 points Monday. Some traders said <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement may have raised fears among foreign investors about political stability here.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a valedictory address to the Republican National Convention, challenged the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates to `` never let the fire go out or quit the fight.'' `` I'm grateful to God for blessing me with a good life and a long one,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in an address that mixed reminiscence of his nearly eight years in the White House with praise for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee-in-waiting. The Monday night timing of the speech was picked by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to avoid stealing the spotlight from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who officially becomes the Republican presidential nominee Wednesday night.

<HEAD>Nancy Reagan Honored at GOP Luncheon</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> surprised his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, with an unscheduled appearance Monday at a luncheon in her honor. `` I really ca n't imagine these last eight years without <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>,'' he said. `` She once said the president has all kinds of advisers and experts ... when it comes to foreign policy, the economy or whatever, but no one to look after his needs as a human being. Well, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> has done that.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, moist-eyed at the tribute, said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has given <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> and me eight of the most wonderful years we have ever had.'' But she added, `` Today the curtain begins to close on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. We have had a wonderful run, but today it is time for the Bushes to step into the political leading roles and for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> to step into the wings.''

 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, putting the finishing touches on his speech accepting the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination, conceded that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be a tough act to follow.

 Two Israeli F-15 jet fighters on a training flight collided over the <LOCATION> Dead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> area Monday and both pilots were killed, the military command reported. It said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Avihu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin-Nun </PERSON>, the air force commander, appointed a commission to investigate. The announcement was held up about 12 hours and gave no further details. Strict censorship delays release of information on events considered to involve national security. The army identified the pilots as Maj. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> of the northern Israeli kibbutz, or communal settlement, of <LOCATION> Merhavya </LOCATION>, and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuller </PERSON> of the northern kibbutz of <PERSON> Kfar </PERSON> <PERSON> Giladi </PERSON>. Informed sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said it was the first known accident <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s air force has had with the high-flying American-built Eagle. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has about 50 of the planes, manufactured by the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and ordered five more earlier in the summer. They were used with deadly force in an air war with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> a decade ago. More than 80 Syrian jets were shot down. None of the Israeli F-15s were lost. The lopsided Israeli victory, and triumphs in other wars with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> enemies, has created an aura of pride and proficiency envied by other air forces around the world. Two other F-15s, owned by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, crashed last June. The planes cost about $ 30 million apiece. Normally, Israeli training exercises with the high-flying jets are conducted over the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert in the southern area of the country, but speculation about Monday's accident centered on the Israeli-held West bank. The F-15, nicknamed the Eagle by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, is the most advanced, land-based jet fighter in the American inventory. The twin-engine jet is designed to fly and fight in all weather conditions and can soar at more than 2 -LCB- times the speed of sound. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is one of few foreign countries that has been allowed to acquire the plane. Even so, the Eagles in its possession are not the most advanced version of the F-15 produced by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>. In recent years, the F-15's safety record has helped the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reduce its overall accident rate to some of the lowest marks ever. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has had three mid-air mishaps involving F-15s this year, but in each case the plane was only damaged, managed to land without further incident and there were no fatalities. Overall, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said, there have been 15 mid-air accidents. The F-15 was first flown in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1972 and was delivered to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> combat squadrons beginning in 1976. Since then, the Eagle has chalked up an overall accident rate of 3.0 mishaps per 100,000 flight hours, which for a jet fighter is very low. The F-15 is normally armed with one internal 20mm cannon and two types of air-to-air `` dogfighting'' missiles, the Sparrow and Sidewinder. The single-seat fighter has a combat altitude ceiling of 65,000 feet.

 <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s primary election Tuesday features a hotly contested <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary that could take a week to untangle because of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concerns over the handling of absentee ballots. State and federal officials tried Monday to avoid a lawsuit that could leave the Democratic race undecided until next week, but Secretary of State <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpan </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> refused to acknowledge that the state had violated federal election laws. Unable to reach an agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brimmer </PERSON> on Monday to order state elections officials to count any absentee ballots received through Aug. 22. <PERSON> Brimmer </PERSON> scheduled a hearing on the matter for Tuesday. Several weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Karpan </PERSON> it would file a lawsuit over the mailing of absentee ballots since some county clerks sent the ballots out just 26 days before the primary instead of at least 30 days. <PERSON> Karpan </PERSON>, however, maintains that there are no specific guidelines governing the mailing of absentee ballots. A wide margin of victory in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary among state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>, state schools Superintendent <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> would make the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s concerns moot. State officials believe that less than 1,000 absentee ballots are involved in the controversy, and with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> registration in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> approaching 60 percent it's possible that just 400 of those ballots were sent to Democrats and so only an extremely tight race would be affected by those ballots. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karpan </PERSON> pointed that out Monday to <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, who refused to wait until after the primary to decide whether to take the state to court, said <PERSON> Karpan </PERSON>. The secretary of state, as a precaution against a court order, did advise all 23 county clerks to hold any absentee ballots received after the polls close Tuesday for at least one week. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> flap capped a primary election campaign dominated by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race, which easily overshadowed uncompetitive <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> contests and state legislative races. <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>, the first to seek the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> nomination, became labor's favorite and later attracted support from environmentalists. <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> counted on the success of her three previous campaigns for superintendent of public instruction. <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> is a political neophyte. Incumbent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> faced little opposition in the Republican primary and spent much of the months leading up to the election reconstructing a campaign machine that twice before had led him to victory in November. When he did campaign, <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> stressed the record he has built over the past 12 years, pointing to his support of Western water rights, a strong defense, and efforts to reduce the tax burdens on the oil and gas industries. In the races for <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s only <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharratt </PERSON> was unopposed for the Democratic nomination while five-term incumbent Republican <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> faced <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who two years ago lost by 63,520 votes. If <PERSON> Cheny </PERSON> wins, his campaign would get off to a slow start. He's scheduled to undergo heart bypass surgery Friday

 An estimated 5,000 people claiming the July elections were fraudulent clogged the steps of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> building Monday as legislators began the process of certifying election results. The crowd parted as <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, presidential candidate of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, arrived to address <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. People showered <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> with confetti and shouted insults at the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> told the legislators: `` What we are asking the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> is one thing _ responsibility. `` We are asking that the elections be cleaned up ... of the innumerable irregularities committed in the electoral process principally by representatives of the official party, by municipal, state and federal authorities.'' The 64-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 500 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> serve as the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, and the session is scheduled to run through Aug. 31. Senators will certify election results for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and the deputies will certify the results for seats in the lower house. The Chamber of Deputies then will certify the count in the presidential balloting. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> won the presidential contest with 50.36 percent of the vote. It said <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> governor and senator who broke with the party last year over democratic reform, received 31.12 percent, and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, candidate of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, obtained 17.07 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> has governed <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1929, dominating both national and state politics, and it is virtually certain that the legislators will name <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> president-elect in the final stage of this year's election process. The new president will be inaugurated Dec. 1, replacing President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> who is completing his six-year term and could not run for re-election under Mexican law. For the first two weeks of the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> session the legislators will review the results of the congressional races. The results for 26 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and at least one <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat are being challenged. Both right-wing and left-wing parties have accused the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> of fraud in the July 6 elections and have held protest rallies almost daily. Opposition leaders claim the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> cheated at the polling places and doctored the voter registration rolls and totals released by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the allegations, the election may have been the most open since the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1929. For the first time, the opposition won seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, gaining four although one is being challenged. And the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> will have have to contend with at least 227 opposition deputies in the lower house, which has been expanded from 400 to 500 seats. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> had 289 seats in the old, 400-seat chamber. The final count depends on the certification of the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. In all previous presidential races the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate received at least 70 percent of the vote. The opposition is awaiting with particular interest the separate returns on the presidential race from about 25,000 of the nation's nearly 55,000 polling places, which the election commission did not make public The commission, after a week-long delay, announced overall totals, saying <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, a 40-year-old former budget director, had won, but it made public the tallies from only about 30,000 polling places.

<TEXT>
 Puerto Rican speakers showed their deep divisions at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Monday over whether statehood, independence or keeping the island's status as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth was the answer to its economic woes. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Decolonization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is holding hearings this week on <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s status, athough the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already has rejected the committee as anti-American. A diplomat on the committee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the committee probably will issue a resolution Wednesday calling for self-determination for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Felice </PERSON>, from an organization called the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> for the Rights and <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> has become poorer than any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state and should be granted independence. But <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, a member of a group called <ORGANIZATION> Puerto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ricans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statehood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, told the committee <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> would benefit more by achieving statehood. <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> said the island still could preserve its Spanish culture. Other speakers said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was actively trying to block the pro-independence movement. Cuban Ambassador <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Oramas-Oliva </PERSON> introduced a resolution which noted allegations that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> was using surveillance to keep track of Puerto Rican independence activists. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seized <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in 1898 during the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. In 1952, Puerto Rican voters overwhelmingly passed a referendum favoring commonwealth status, and the following year the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> removed <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> from its list of colonies. Since 1973, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Decolonization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has adopted numerous resolutions calling <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> an illegal colony and demanding self-determination for its people. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected those resolutions as interference in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> internal affairs, and in 1971 walked off the committee, saying it had an anti-American bias. Pro-statehood speakers told the committee Monday that 95 percent of the island's voters rejected independence in a 1984 election and that the solution to poverty is to make <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> the 51st <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Susler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> described the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attitude toward the commonwealth as colonial, saying pro-independence advocates are added to blacklists compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and shared with the Puerto Rican police.

<HEAD>Witness Says Liberace's `Penniless' Sister Has Been Paid $132,000</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An accountant testified Monday that the sister of the late <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> has been paid nearly $ 132,000 since his death 18 months ago and has $ 511,000 remaining in her trust account. The testimony conflicted with that given last week by <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, 74, who described herself as `` penniless.'' Certified Public Accountant <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON> revealed the figures in state <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in the ongoing legal battle involving efforts to remove the executor of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s estate. Both sides rested Monday after weeks of testimony and closing arguments were scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. Then it will be up to Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> to decide whether to remove <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> as executor of the Liberace estate and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> foundation. A sister and four former associates have filed suit seeking to have <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> removed, saying he drew up the will and had <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> sign it when the famed pianist was too ill to comprehend what he was doing. Those testifying on the attorney's behalf say <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was well enough to know what he was doing when he signed the will Jan. 22, 1987, and that <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> had done a good job of increasing the value of the estate. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> testified he did not know what was taking the life of his famous client until after the will was signed 13 days before <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> died Feb. 4, 1987, from AIDS complications. <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> testified last week she was `` penniless'' and had to live off charity. But <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON> testified Monday that the sister had been paid an average of $ 7,755 a month the first 17 months following her brother's death. <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON> discounted the contention that <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> had kept money from the sister. `` Mr. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> was concerned that <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> be able to get the money as needed,'' <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON> testified. `` Up until four or five months ago we had been told to give her almost anything she wanted.'' <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON>, who oversees the <ORGANIZATION> Angie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irrevocable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> and disburses its funds, said in recent months he has been asked to obtain authority for any expenditures from the trust, which <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> set up for his sister. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> testified earlier that he put restrictions on the account because he was concerned over the rate which the money was being spent. <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON> said he had been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing Arts since the entertainer formed the foundation in 1979 to provide scholarships at 30 colleges and universities. <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> had conducted foundation meetings since the organization was formed.

 Here are excerpts from the prepared text of the speech by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the Republican National Convention on Monday night. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I are so honored to be your guest tonight _ to share a little of your special time. And we thank you. ... ... Eight years ago, we gathered in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in a troubled time for our beloved country. ... That year, it was our dream that together we would rescue <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and make a New Beginning _ to create anew that shining city on a hill. ... It was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to preserve world peace and freedom and to recapture our national destiny. ... And on the night of July l7, 1980, we left with a mutual pledge to conduct a national crusade to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> great again. ... And my fellow citizens, while our triumph is not yet complete, the road has been glorious, indeed. ... Before we came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Americans had just suffered the two worst back-to-back years of inflation in 60 years. Those are the facts. ... And as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said: `` Facts are stubborn things....'' ... When they sat around the kitchen table, it was not to plan summer vacations, it was to plan economic survival. ... When we met in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in that summer of 1980 _ it was a summer of discontent for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> around the world. Our national defense had been so weakened, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had begun to engage in reckless aggression. ... ... Our embassy in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was burned to the ground, and the one in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was stormed and occupied with all Americans taken as hostages. ... We rolled up our sleeves and went to work in January of 1981; we focused on hope, not despair. ... We said something shocking. Taxes ought to be reduced, not raised. ... We rebuilt our armed forces. We liberated <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> from the communists and helped return that island to democracy. We struck a firm blow against Libyan terrorism. We've seen the growth of democracy in 90 percent of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Soviets have begun to pull out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The bloody Iran-Iraq war is coming to an end. For the first time in eight years we have the prospects of peace in <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the removal of Cuban and other foreign forces from the region. And in the 2,765 days of our administration, not one inch of ground has fallen to the communists. Today, we have the first treaty in world history to eliminate an entire class of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet nuclear missiles. We are working on the strategic defense initiative to defend ourselves and our allies against nuclear terror, and American-Soviet relations are the best they've been since World War II. And virtually all this change occurred _ and continues to occur _ in spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudly proclaim that it's time for a change. ...

<HEAD>Wildfires Continue in West, Hot Weather Partly to Blame</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A lightning-caused forest fire in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> was threatening homes Monday, and firefighters at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> were forced to close an entrance when smoke from an 80-square-mile blaze hampered visibility. Smaller fires were being fought in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and officials said hot, dry weather played a role in most. `` We have engines at every homesite or building that is in danger,'' Lame Deer, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, fire information officer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said of the 6,000-acre blaze on the northern <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> Indian Reservation in the southeastern part of the state. Six to eight structures were in the fire's path, he said. Bulldozers and road graders were used to clear debris and crews burned fire lines around the homes to save them. With temperatures in the 90s and winds of 10 mph to 20 mph, flames shot right up to the yards around two homes on the main road up the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lame </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said some residents left their homes temporarily. No injuries were reported. At <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON> said a road at the park's west entrance was closed Monday afternoon, although officials expected it to reopen later in the day. It was the second road closed Monday. Earlier, the road to the Old Faithful Geyser also was closed because of low visibility caused by smoke from the 52,960-acre. High winds pushed the fire toward the park's main roadway Monday afternoon, <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> said. The hot, dry weather feeding the <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> fires, also fueled a number of new lightning fires in northwestern and southeastern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. And in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, high winds and no precipitation prompted <ORGANIZATION> Nez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> officials to postpone trying to control the 2,175-acre Ruby Rapids fire on the <LOCATION> Main </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salmon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Both the <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Payette </PERSON> forests in west-central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> expected another round of dry lightning storms to ignite even more blazes. In the <ORGANIZATION> Nez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, about 300 firefighters were battling nearly 50 blazes, most of them 10 acres or less. Lightning in the last three days continued to spark fires as officials contended with dwindling manpower and equipment. Oregon fire officials contained a 50-acre fire Sunday as a wave of thunderstorms brought the threat of more fires to parched central and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION>. And in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, crews completed fire lines around a 900-acre blaze on the Ute Indian Reservation.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday rejected an appeal for a retrial by convicted spy <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Treholt </PERSON>, ending the former <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official's hopes for a reversal of his 20-year prison sentence. <PERSON> Treholt </PERSON>, 45, was sentenced by a district court in June 1985 to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s maximum prison term.

Police claimed last year they had uncovered a plan by <PERSON> Treholt </PERSON> to escape to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with a girlfriend. <PERSON> Treholt </PERSON>'s appeal was based on arguments that evidence was misinterpreted, a police witness withheld important information and there were technical mistakes during his trial.

The wounded mother fled screaming for help, said the spokeswoman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. `` The man then attacked the child who received fatal injuries,'' she said. Neighbor <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, 21, said he heard shouting and screaming just after noon. `` I went outside and there was a woman running down the stairs screaming,'' he said. `` The woman was hysterical and was screaming, ` My child, my child _ he has got my child!'

 Arizona Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, recalling his captivity in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, depicted <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as weak on defense issues Monday and compared the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee to former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` In this presidential race, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> alone has the experience and knowledge to continue the policy of a strong defense, coupled with a willingness to negotiate,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> told the Republican National Convention. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> before him, clearly does n't understand that,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seems to believe that the Trident -LRB- submarine-based nuclear missile -RRB- is a chewing gum, that the B-1 -LRB- bomber -RRB- is a vitamin pill, and that the Midgetman -LRB- land-based nuclear missile -RRB- is anyone shorter than he is,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> spoke to the convention on its opening night as delegates eagerly awaited the address of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who was delivering something of a farewell to his party as well as a strong endorsement of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> watched <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>'s speech from his seat in the Superdome convention hall, and with the delegates watched a brief film about <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>'s ordeal during the Vietnam War.

 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, addressing the convention he had hoped would be nominating him, compared <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> on Monday and said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would fulfill the president's `` powerful legacy.'' With his hopes still alive for becoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> praised the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> record and urged the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to reach out to blacks, Hispanics and other minorities. `` As the party of <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> _ and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ we believe that freedom and hope and opportunity ca n't be for just some of us,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` They've got to be for all of us. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has got to keep moving ahead, and we ca n't leave anyone behind,'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, whose bid for the Republican presidential nomination fizzled in the early primaries, took the platform at the Republican National Convention shortly before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was delivering his farewell to his party. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, watched from their seats in the Superdome convention hall as <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> spoke for 18 minutes. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, a favorite of many in the party's right wing, was greeted by red signs bearing his name and the words `` I Back Jack.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was the object of an intense campaign by conservatives, who consider him <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ideological heir, pressing for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to select <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> as his vice presidential nominee. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and two other prominent Republicans, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, took the podium on the opening night of the convention to describe for delegates the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> successes. `` <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, the founder of our <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, gave this nation a new birth of freedom. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has helped give the whole world a new birth of freedom,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` Nations around the world are following our example, choosing lower tax rates, less government and more freedom,'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, a leading advocate of the income tax cut <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pushed through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in his first term. Speaking to the president, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had `` brought us to the threshold of a new era _ in fact, you've brought us over the threshold.'' `` You've shown us that we can do more than contain our adversaries _ we can transcend them,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s support for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the `` Star Wars'' nuclear defense system, has `` shown us how we can make even the threat of nuclear war obsolete.'' And he credited <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with leading `` an entrepreneurial renaissance'' that has `` electrified the world and raised our standard of living'' while creating 17 million jobs in five years. `` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, it's a powerful legacy that you are handing us here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` I just want you and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> to know that, under the able leadership of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, this party is going to take it and run with it. And we're going to win in November.''

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> has established diplomatic relations with some nations in its Soviet bloc counterpart, <ORGANIZATION> COMECON </ORGANIZATION>, the West German government announced Monday. Communist East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency also reported the development. Both the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, also known as the European Common Market, and COMECOM are basically economic and trading blocs. ADN quoted East German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> as saying the development contributes to the creation of a `` common European house.'' That phrase has been used in recent weeks by communist leaders calling for closer links between Eastern and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. West German government spokesman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> released a statement in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> saying, `` The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- EEC -RRB- has established official relations with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as well as with other member states of <ORGANIZATION> COMECON </ORGANIZATION>.'' A West German government official said Monday night that at least four of the 11 <ORGANIZATION> COMECON </ORGANIZATION> countries had established formal ties with the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and others were expected to follow. The official, speaking on condition he not be identified, identified the four as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. The other <ORGANIZATION> COMECON </ORGANIZATION> members are <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON>'s statement said the `` establishing of missions in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> -LRB- the headquarters of the EEC -RRB- by <ORGANIZATION> COMECON </ORGANIZATION> member nations can ease economic cooperation'' between the two blocs. Two months ago, <ORGANIZATION> COMECON </ORGANIZATION>, which stands for the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> paved the way to establish formal ties by signing documents of mutual recognition. Talks between the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> COMECON </ORGANIZATION> on establishing links began in September 1986.

<HEAD>U.S. Officer Negligent In Accidental Bombing Of Ship, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it suspects a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> airman was negligent in the 1987 accidental bombing of a Malaysian-registered ship in which a crew member was seriously injured. An official said the agency, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s coast guard, sent a report of its investigation Monday to Japanese public prosecutors. The report said Lt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Foster was taking part in air exercises off <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> on July 27, 1987, that involved dropping non-explosive practice bombs on a target, the official said. Bombs from his airplane twice hit the 5,922-ton Malaysian ship Pomex-Saga, badly injuring the arm of a Filipino crewman, the agency official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> mistook the ship for his intended target and neglected to confirm its identity with radar, he quoted the report as saying. Under the U.S.-Japan Status of Forces Agreement, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> can not prosecute members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military who violate Japanese laws while on duty, and <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> has not been indicted, the official said. The official said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials, who have jurisdiction in the case, had not yet confirmed the report's findings. On Monday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military paid $ 10,000 in partial compensation to the injured crewman, identified as <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Roca </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Foster's home town was not immediately available, and attempts to contact <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officals for comment Monday night proved unavailing.

 <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators reported reaching a compromise Monday on a county government reorganization bill inspired in part by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> corruption investigation in which 56 county supervisors were charged. After doubts earlier in the day on whether differences could be settled between versions the two chambers approved in a special legislative session, chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiator <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> said an agreement was reached. He said it would be brought before the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for approval Tuesday. `` I did not want to be held responsible, as I was held responsible last May, that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> killed the bill,'' he said. The plan to restructure county government stemmed from an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation of corrupt county purchasing practices that led to federal charges ranging from mail fraud to extortion against 56 supervisors in 25 counties. Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> called the special session to consider instituting countywide administration in place of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s unique system in which most counties are split into districts in which locally elected supervisors govern decisions such as purchasing and road maintenance <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> said his conferees had backed off a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provision that would have required counties to purchase at least 10 percent of equipment, supplies and services from businesses owned by minorities and women. He said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferees had accepted a provision granting `` home rule'' to counties, but senators had allowed to be stricken language prohibiting them from entering collective bargaining agreements. Under home rule, counties would be allowed to take actions not specifically prohibited by law. Under current statutes, they may take only those actions expressly permitted. Cities were granted home rule in 1985. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> said negotiators had accepted the House language on the wording of a referendum for voters to decide if their counties would maintain roads on a countywide or district basis. He said they had `` split'' on <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> language that would have exempted from the referendum requirement those counties that were in `` substantial compliance'' with provisions of the bill on Oct. 1. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agreed that a county supervisor could not serve as county administrator, road manager, purchasing clerk, receiving clerk or inventory clerk. Of the 56 supervisors charged, 42 have pleaded guilty, six have been convicted, one has been acquitted, one died before going to trial, one died after sentencing, and another was declared mentally incompetent to stand trial. The remaining ones still have charges pending.

 Republican presidential nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have made his decision on a running mate by the time he arrives in the Republican convention city Tuesday, a top campaign aide hinted Monday night. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deputy campaign manager, told a reporter on the convention floor that he expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would acknowledge he had made his choice, but would not disclose the identity. `` If you asked the question, I think that's not an unlikely thing for him to say,'' said <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. Campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> talked with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from a telephone in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> delegation and said he was told the announcement of the running mate was `` set for Thursday, but it's flexible.'' While the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has scheduled a news conference for Thursday morning, there have been persistent rumors that making the announcement on Wednesday, perhaps through a joint appearance at the convention hall, was under discussion. The last word directly from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came on Monday morning and he said that he had not made up his mind. Meanwhile, potential <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidents made a whirlwind round of appearances in this convention city, some openly touting their qualifications, others playing coy. One prospect, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, complained that the selection process was dragging on too long. `` I do n't care for it, frankly,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> when asked if felt the process was demeaning. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who had urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make his selection right after the Democratic convention in July, said he felt the Republicans were giving the Democratic ticket `` a five-week head start.'' Not far from the Superdome, where the convention opened with a prenoon session, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told a news conference, `` I would be a terrific campaigner and a terrific candidate and a terrific vice president.'' The rumor mill worked nonstop, trickling out new names. The latest to surface were two <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> senators, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. Convention manager <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> told a news conference that speech writers would soon begin work on `` a generic kind of acceptance speech'' to serve as a base for whomever is chosen for the vice presidential nomination. In addition, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said the writers also would draft nominating speeches that would require filling in the blanks with the right name and background. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s media adviser, was taping one-on-one interviews with prospective choices. In the interviews, potential choices were asked such questions as why they thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would make a good president. It was believed that the interviews would be used for television commercials. While most prospects were less bullish than <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> on their qualifications, they made it clear they would love to be tapped for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> described himself as `` an extreme long-shot'' in the veep sweepstakes. But he also suggested that as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate `` I could help on the economy, I could help on the immigrant vote.'' The senator's parents were Italian immigrants. The <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> family _ the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator and his wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> _ appeared at a series of receptions. `` We finally had to leave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to come down here,'' quipped the senator `` so we got a recording on the machine at home, just in case they got the wrong number. It just says, ` I accept.''' `` If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thinks I can offer the most to the ticket ... <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will sign up immediately,'' said the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator. `` You really ca n't campaign for the office of vice president,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, as he arrived for an appearance before the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> delegation. `` I'm here because <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knows who I am. He decided to put me on a list.'' Former White House staff chief <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> professed to be mystified by the mention of his name. `` My name's not on that list,'' he said. `` I've made it perfectly clear, I've no desire to be vice president.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the man with the list and the power of decision, said, `` I have not decided.'' `` I probably will say when I have decided,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program, `` Good Morning America.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said, `` He's going to call the schedule the way he sees fit. He knows that pretty well, building a lot of suspense. He knows when he's going to make up his mind. He's just not telling us. The vice president was flying to the convention city Tuesday, and most speculation was that he would make his decision before arriving in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said he thought that going into the weekend <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` had received the input he wanted'' on the field of potential running mates. The list of prospects appeared to include the Doles, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, and Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, a former governor of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he was at the convention only to hear President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Monday night speech and would return to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> ducked a question about how he would respond to an offer of the vice presidential nomination. `` I have no reason to think that's going to happen,'' he said. But there also were hints that the list could be larger. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> show `` Today'' whether he had dropped from his list those prospects, including <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, who said they were n't interested, the vice president replied, `` I would n't say that at all. That statement could reopen speculation about Govs. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, both of whom have said they do n't want to be considered. Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, a close friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said he had talked to the vice president on Saturday and `` I know there are some people who have not been on those lists who are still in his mind, so it could be a surprise.'' Vice presidential activity was n't limited to the appearances of potential running mates. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> was leading a conservative effort to persuade <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to choose someone acceptable to the party's right wing `` I think my choice will be widely accepted _ when I decide on who that choice is,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said on the `` Today'' show. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said, `` My conservative friends are going to be happy with the ticket and the platform.'' But the opposite end of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> spectrum also was finding hope in the prospects. `` It's going to be a tall ticket,'' predicted Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a reference to the 6-foot-7 <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> senator, while generally regarded as a conservative, supports a woman's right to abortion and is open to a tax increase to deal with the federal budget deficit, positions that put him more in tune with moderates such as <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>

 The handicaps a young golfer encountered on a course in this central Swedish town Monday were one enormous moose and what may have been the muddiest swamp in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the Swedish news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> reported. This is the account <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> gave: After a badly hooked shot, the golfer went looking for the ball among trees lining the fairway and found himself face-to-face with a huge moose. Frightened, he ran deeper into the forest to escape the animal, and promptly got stuck knee-high in a muddy swamp. Hours later, he was rescued by party of golfers who heard his cries for help. The agency did not give the golfer's name. Nor did it say whether a moose and a quagmire were par for that course.

<HEAD>DeSillers Fails to Turn Over Property</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who allegedly bought a car, jewelry and clothes with nearly $ 500,000 donated for her late son's three liver transplants failed to turn the items over Monday and faces contempt charges. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> also failed to post a $ 100,000 bond as an alternative, said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>, the court-appointed curator of <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' estate who was supposed to receive the property. `` The order clearly has been violated,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> DiSillers </PERSON>' attorney `` has indicated no bond has been posted, and I have personal knowledge that the property has not been turned over to me.'' Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> said she would file a contempt order Tuesday with Dade Circuit Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, who will then schedule a hearing. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, 7, died at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in April 1987 while awaiting his fourth transplant. Contributions, including $ 1,000 from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, had poured in after a small fund collected by <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s school was reported stolen. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> refuses to pay the hospital about $ 262,000 in medical bills because she says her son received improper care, a charge hospital administrators deny. She also has refused to cooperate with authorities and account for the rest of the money. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> believes about $ 242,000 remains of the nearly $ 690,000 donated for the boy's liver transplants. At a last-minute hearing before <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> earlier Monday, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> sought to put off complying with an order issued last week that she turn the disputed items over to the court. Her attorney told the judge that items in Ms. DeSillers' home were valued at $ 4,500, and that bonding companies refused to issue a $ 100,000 bond for them. But <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> brushed aside the objection and ordered Ms. DeSillers to turn the items, including a BMW luxury car, over to Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> by 4 p.m., or post the bond. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> said Ms. DeSillers never showed up.

 Five Iranian fishermen, rescued by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> eight days ago from their drifting dinghy in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, were headed home Monday after hopscotch visits to four American warships. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources said the five were to be turned over to <LOCATION> Omani </LOCATION> authorities at <LOCATION> Goat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> and then delivered to Iranian diplomatic officials. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.

They were without food and their water supply had run out. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military doctors said they were suffering from exposure, deyhdration, hypothermia and rashes and probably could not have survived another 24 hours. The Vincennes mistakenly shot down an Iranian civilian jetliner on July 3 and all 290 persons aboard perished. The cruiser rescued the fishermen after lookouts saw the flash of cigarette lighters and heard voices shouting in the pre-dawn darkness. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was ordered on another mission, according to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources, and the five were transferred to the missile cruiser <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that subsequently sent them to the frigate Fanning. After a week of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> chow they were shifted to the destroyer <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> that took them to the Omani base in the <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> at the southern end of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Doctors Urge Chavez to Consider Ending Fast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DELANO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors said Monday farm labor leader <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> was weak and dizzy and should consider ending his monthlong fast in protest of pesticide use on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grapes. `` We are extremely concerned about the possibility of irreversible damage to his health,'' the physicians said in a prepared statement. `` The longer he continues his water-only fast, the closer he comes to reaching the point where his life will be in danger.'' <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said he would consider it, said Dr. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, whose fast was in its 30th day Monday, had not suffered irreversible damage even though he had lost 30 pounds, 17 percent of his original 174-pound weight, <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> said. But the joint statement signed by <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, Dr. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> was weak and dizzy, has a high uric acid level, which is dangerous to his internal organs, and is having increased difficulty maintaining proper fluids. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> began a water-only fast on July 17 to call attention to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>' boycott of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grapes and claims that workers and consumers are endangered by five pesticides. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> raised the pesticide issue in 1986 and demanded that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> growers stop using Captan, <PERSON> Dinoseb </PERSON>, methyl bromide, Parathion and <LOCATION> Phosdrin </LOCATION>. The union contends tolerance levels of those chemicals `` were set without toxicity data or any information concerning their long-term effects on people's health and the environment.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, a pesticide expert with the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, countered that all five chemicals are tightly controlled. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> conducted a 25-day fast during the 1968 grape boycott.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> claims the famed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Circus is mistreating its performing bears by confining them in small cages and on Monday it threatened court action. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bain </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> investigator, said the 12 brown bears are being psychologically mistreated by being held in cages measuring about 3 feet by 4 -LCB- feet. He said the society will file a complaint accusing the circus of cruelty to animals if it does n't provide larger cages or better treatment by Wednesday. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, a promoter of the Soviet company's tour that includes shows in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> next month, said the bears are `` treated great'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> was misleading the public. <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, of Concert Productions International, said the bears are excercised daily and <ORGANIZATION> Bain </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that they are confined up to 16 hours a day `` is totally inaccurate.'' He said the bears are raised by their Soviet trainers from birth and are in excellent health. `` I'm glad the trainers ca n't understand English,'' he added `` If they heard what is being said about their bears they'd be very upset.'' <PERSON> Bain </PERSON> said the bears' daily training routines, in which they walk on their front legs and ride bicycles, are not adequate exercise for the animals, which weigh from about 195 to 300 pounds. He said the bears `` are suffering from severe behaviorial problems'' because of the psychological strain of confinement. The circus begins a three-week run Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exhibition </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, with the bears performing once or twice a day. <PERSON> Bain </PERSON> also criticized the circus for its treatment of a pregnant Siberian tiger shipped to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He said the animal gave birth during a 15-day sea voyage from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. Circus manager <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Thrasher </PERSON> said the tiger was transported by sea because it would have been traumatized had it been moved by airplane. <PERSON> Bain </PERSON> insisted the tiger should not have been moved at all. He said the other animals in the circus appeared to be healthy.

 `` There was the good news and bad news from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The good news was that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> laid all those cards on the table. The bad news is they were all face down.'' Laughter. Applause. `` The Democrats asked the wrong question. The question was not ` where's <PERSON> George </PERSON>?' The question is, ` who's <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>?''' Laughter. Applause. This was the introduction to the introduction, or to be more exact, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> introducing former Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, whose job it was to introduce <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, of course, was the only person at the Republican National Convention who needed introduction to no one. But political conventions being what they are, <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> spent five minutes welcoming <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who was about to enter the hall. `` I do n't have to give a ringing political speech,'' said <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, who was described by <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> as the president's `` first friend.'' `` Nor do I have to speak of his many political accomplishments and the legacy he leaves,'' said <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>. Instead, he spoke of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the person. `` To <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the Golden Rule is very much alive. ... He has faithfully stuck to his conservative guns. ... His eternal optimism is infectious _ if there's a pony in the pile, give him time and he'll find it every time.'' Then <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> entered with his wife and the applause and cheering from the delegates and visitors lasted exactly the five minutes it had been scheduled. Many in the huge Superdome could n't see the first couple in person so they watched the entrance via huge screens on three sides of the hall. It presented a peculiar picture of heads turned in all directions. This was the night for lauding the president who's about to leave. The praise for the man Republicans hope will be the president-to-be comes later. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the congressman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and former football star, likened <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the Gipper _ a character that actor <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> played in the movie `` <ORGANIZATION> Knute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockne </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We all remember the famous line about winning one for the Gipper,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. But, he said he preferred another scene, the one in which <PERSON> Rockne </PERSON> tells the Gipper he would be given the ball and he should just run with it. `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the Gipper, just looks at him with that smile of his,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> recalled, `` and says, ` how far, Coach?''' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> turned toward <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, sitting across the hall in a box decorated with the presidential scene. `` Well, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said, `` when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> gave you the ball eight years ago, no one could have imagined how far you would carry it.'' Later, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also evoked the old movie, with a request for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON>,'' said the president, `` go out there and make it one more for the Gipper.''

 A calculating error by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration budget experts can not be rectified by law and is preventing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from enacting $ 1.2 billion in additional spending programs for 1989. The over-calculation of the size of next year's deficit was pointed out to congressional aides in the last few days by the agency that committed it _ the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Management and Budget. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> officials confirmed this past week that the mistake had been made, and said they had told congressional staff members about it. As the $ 1.1 trillion federal budget goes, $ 1.2 billion normally would barely register a tick. But the amount is significant because it means that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to squeeze spending for anti-drug programs, the homeless, the hungry and other popular causes under a $ 1.8 billion ceiling, rather than what should be a $ 3 billion limit.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet scientists, ignoring a diplomatic gaffe half a world away, are conducting rehearsals for this week's historic nuclear experiment that will mark a milestone in the atomic age.

The joint verification experiment is designed to measure each country's ability to monitor the size of the other's test. Verification could lead to ratification of treaties limiting the size of nuclear tests, which were signed in the 1974 and 1976 but never ratified. Scientists from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be measuring the explosive punch of a thermonuclear device encased in a steel canister buried 2,050 feet beneath a picturesque mesa, 130 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>.

 Citing the potential of terrorist attack, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are putting the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on notice that they will strongly oppose any move to permit sea shipment of plutonium from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Here you have an administration that is supposedly waging a war on terrorism, but promoting a policy that could make terrorism easy,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The issue stems from a recently signed U.S.-Japan nuclear cooperation treaty that authorizes shipments by air of plutonium from reprocessing plants in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> back to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where it will be used to fuel nuclear power plants. The plutonium, which also could be utilized for nuclear weapons, is controlled by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government because the nuclear fuel originated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Proceeding with the air shipments was made contingent upon development of crash-proof shipping casks, which so far has proven unachievable.

 College students reduced their drinking more if their assumptions about alcohol's benefits were challenged than if they were warned about its dangers, psychologists say. `` We're looking at this as an approach to prevention'' of problem drinking, said researcher <PERSON> Renelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. Study results support a theory that one reason people drink is because they think it will make them funny, brave, more sociable, sexier, more assertive or better in some other way, she said. Levels of such `` expectancies'' have been linked to alcohol consumption in previous studies, she said in an interview Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting.

 No one can say that we'll never see the likes of him again, but <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be a hard act for any president to follow. The man actually enjoys the job. Everything about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> shows his pleasure with the best role of his actor's life. It's in his body language. He bounds onstage for speeches; he looks interested in the other guy's speech; he laughs at every punch line. His wave to crowds is never forced. Amiability is his strong suit. Used to taking orders from directors in his earlier career, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has surrounded himself with aides to whom he delegates much authority. That enables him to be what he said he would be, a 9-to-5 executive who does not take work home.

 Americans had more babies in 1987 than in any year in nearly a quarter-century, but at the same time the nation recorded more deaths than any year in history. Last year also saw the lowest marriage and divorce rates in over a decade, according to figures compiled by the government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> A slight increase in fertility, coupled with the huge number of women in their prime childbearing years, resulted in an estimated 3,829,000 new arrivals last year, the most since 1964, the center reported Monday in its preliminary statistical summery for 1987. Millions of people born in the post-World War II Baby Boom are now in their 20s and 30s and, after completing school and launching careers, have begun families. That has led to a sharp increase in the total number of births in recent years, although the nation's rate of 66.1 births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 remains at about half that of the late 1950s, when the Baby Boom was at its peak.

The 0.8 percent July advance was double the 0.4 percent June increase and marked the 10th consecutive month that industrial production has risen.

For that reason, he said, astronomers are anxious that unneccessary uses of radio signals be eliminated. In many cases, gross radio interference sources could be controlled with the use of filters or shields that would add only a dollar or two to manufacturing costs, he said.

 The heir to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s throne is a prince who fosters economic reform and political openness for his nation in the midst of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> turmoil. `` There has been a continous cry on my part ... for a need to think seriously of Jordanian perestroika,'' said <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, referring to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plans to revitalize Soviet society. The 41-year-old younger brother of King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is regarded as one of the Arab world's most visible intellectuals. For two decades, the Oxford-educated prince has guided development planning in this country of 2.8 million people. He has overseen remarkable economic growth in a land blessed by education but nearly barren of natural resources. With an economic slump squeezing the region, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> has urged bureaucratic reforms and calls for economic policies aimed at making the Hashemite desert kingdom a center for services and technology. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> sees economic success as a major element of identity for his 40-year-old country, along with his family's 1,000-year history as rulers of Mecca. He said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the task of rebuilding <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> following the disastrous 1967 war with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which flooded the country with refugees, was one of `` restating <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s credibility on the basis of merit; that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> is a country that works.'' He also describes the war as his greatest trauma. Most of his published works have been devoted to the Palestine problem, urging a moderate road to <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace. About half or more of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s population are Palestinians; most of the remainder are <PERSON> Bedouin </PERSON> <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>, like King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s failure in its efforts for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace led King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in early August to renounce responsibility for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision is expected to force <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to forge a new identity for itself, one in which <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> likely would play a role because of his leadership of the kingdom's economic and research institutions. The prince himself is key to the survival of the last Hashemite monarchy. His family, descended from <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, once ruled <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. It led the Arabs to independence from Ottoman <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in a World War I alliance with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. His patronage of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s intellectual and business communities, as well as his periodic tours of army installations, are partly designed to help broaden his base in a country so closely identified with its ruler that a common cliche says: `` King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> was an Oxford undergraduate in Oriental studies when <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> named him crown prince in 1965. He said his Oxford years were `` definitely the happiest years of my life,'' and an academic aura still clings to him. He described himself as `` a magpie reader,'' sampling a wide range of subjects. But he said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s book, `` Perestroika,'' was the most fascinating thing he had read lately _ along with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> philosopher <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s `` In Praise of Idleness.'' Short, stocky and athletic, the prince seldom seems idle. He spends his spare time practicing Chinese martial arts, playing squash or polo, and with his family. The prince has four children by his Pakistani-born wife, Princess <PERSON> Tharwat </PERSON>, but none have a direct line to the throne. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has decreed that his own third son, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Aly </PERSON>, is in line after <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>. Jordanian television often shows <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> addressing two or three seminars or conferences a day in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, or attending international conferences on development or humanitarian affairs. He helped found most of the country's chief think tanks, and said he enjoys seminars where he can step out of his palace role. `` Nobody's going to stand up to a person of authority and express their views as clearly as they should,'' he said. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> has repeatedly urged freer debate on domestic policy issues, occasionally bumping heads with government officials concerned about criticism. The prince said <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> should `` emphasize our basic renewable resource, which is creative thought and political will based on an openness which I think has characterized King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s style.'' He has also prodded Arabs to develop their own `` centers of excellence'' and said he was `` somewhat resentful'' of the Western dominance of Middle Eastern studies. `` I think that regional self-reliance in the intellectual field is the only way of tempering that -LRB- Western -RRB- naivite, which is welcome in terms of its innocence but tiresome in terms of its clumsiness,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Attempt to Repair Battered Health Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Sandinista government is attempting to push ahead with ambitious health care programs that suffered severe setbacks because of seven years of civil war. `` We are just beginning to move ahead a bit. But we have a long way to go,'' Dr. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, deputy health minister, said in an interview. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> promised improved health care as part of a package of social pledges made after they ousted the rightist Somoza dynasty in July 1979. Shortly after coming to power, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> set out to build clinics and install a socialistic medical system. `` Our policies were based on health being a right for the people and an obligation of the state,'' <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said. But the promises of the leftist government gave way to the realities of the war started by <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels 1 -LCB- years after the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> took control. The battles destroyed more than 100 rural clinics by the end of last year, helped bring back such diseases as malaria and created combat-related mental problems. The situation was further complicated in 1985 when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo cut off many supplies and spare parts for medical equipment. Health officials acknowlege that not all of the problems can be blamed on the war. A lack of hygiene education and basic unsanitary conditions in the capital as well as the isolated rural farmlands are blamed for a current epidemic of dengue, an infectious disease carried by mosquitos. During six days in July, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported, almost 3,000 children were treated for diarrhea, the No. 1 killer of children in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The government recently called on residents in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to clean-up the trash and cut the grass in their neighborhoods. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said health programs suffered serious deterioration by 1983 with the loss of clinics and personnel and doctors who fled the country. `` We had constructed a health system for peace. It clashed with the war,'' <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> added. `` We had malaria under control along the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. But then we began large troop mobilizations to the mountains, where malaria still existed, and they brought it back to the cities.'' Doctors and medical volunteers could n't get into remote combat regions or those controlled by the Contras. Barricada International, a Sandinista publication, said in a recent edition that 600 students, health workers and teachers had been killed, wounded or kidnapped while working in war zones. Mental problems stemming from combat surfaced. `` It's difficult to confront. The ones who spend two years fighting have the most problems,'' <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said. `` We have seen an increase in violent deaths _ homicides and suicides _ and more aggressiveness in general.'' One woman told a reporter her son returned from almost two years in combat with serious emotional problems. `` He would scream in his sleep that the Contras were coming,'' she said. `` He would become nervous when he was awake.'' <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said mental problems also are found among the numerous ex-soldiers who suffered losses of limbs in the war. `` It's not the actual loss of limb that causes the problems but the psychological part,'' he said. `` The combatants are No. 2 on our priority list. No. 1 are the children.'' The Health Ministry this year outlined a three-year plan and designated 1988 the year `` for defense and protection of children's lives. Infant mortality, halved since July 1979, stands at 64.5 per 1,000 births. It is the highest in Central America. Health workers have been taking advantage of a fragile truce since March to vaccinate rural children against polio, measles, diptheria and tuberculosis. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said it was too soon to rebuild the lost clinics because fighting continues and the economy still is suffering. Medical care is free but medicine is not, <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said. Only about 10 percent of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s doctors work with the state system. The others are private practitioners. Medicines are among a long list of basics that are in need. Black marketeers make large profits selling medications at outdoor markets. The largest single cause of death to adults up to age 49 last year was related to the war, Health Ministry statistics indicated. The ministry said it has detected only 26 cases of AIDS in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and that only five of those were Nicaraguans.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After years of exile and scorn for the ballot box, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s leftist political parties allied with Marxist-led guerrillas are preparing to compete in next year's presidential election `` Elections here between 1982 and now have been part of a plan designed principally to counter action of the guerrilla army, part of a counter-insurgency project,'' said <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON>, organization secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. `` It could therefore be argued that we are now lending our support for that same project, and that we're contradicting ourselves,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON> added, more `` political space has opened up'' since the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and four other <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries signed a peace plan Aug. 7, 1987. `` We want to take maximum advantage of that political opening, even though we are certain that doing political work in those spaces is like swimming in a river full of crocodiles,'' he said in an interview in his party's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> headquarters. The regional plan has not ended guerrilla conflicts in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, but it has contributed to broadening the range of political expression in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, has been allied since 1981 with the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla organization known as the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> that has been fighting the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government for eight years. Leaders of the political front who had left in the early 1980s because of rampant rightist death squads began returning to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in November and are still coming. Among them are <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>'s party is a left-leaning offshoot of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who sat on military-civilian juntas in 1980-82 and has governed since 1984. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has cancer and his doctors say it is terminal. The Oqueli's Revolutionay Movement, the Social Christians and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have formed the Democratic Convergence. <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON>'s group announced in July its participation, via the Convergence, in the presidential election set for March. Although the electoral front has yet to announce its participation officially, it is already hard at work launching a campaign. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said the Convergence's activity `` is generating a political alternative capable of attracting ample sectors of the population that have been left without alternative.'' `` We're also contributing little by little to overcoming people's fear, because of past repression, of participating in politics,'' he said. The leftists do not harbor illusions of an electoral victory. `` We are not taking part strictly for the votes, rather we're mounting a historical project that transcends election day,'' said <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON> The main plank in the leftist platform is a negotiated end to the war. The government has rejected two such proposals by the insurgents so far this year. `` The country's principal problem is the war,'' <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON> said. `` If the armed conflict is not resolved, we will not be able to resolve the economic, social and political problems _ health, housing, nutrition, employment. So we're telling the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> people that a solution to the war is necessary, and for us that solution is a negotiated political one.'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s position is that the guerrillas lay down their arms before talks can begin, but the rebels say that would be tantamount to surrender. The guerrillas imposed a nationwide transport ban during legislative and municipal elections in March to underscore their characterization of them as `` a farce.'' The prospect of watching their political allies take part in similar elections next year is thought to be a difficult pill for them to swallow. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> does n't have to either approve or disapprove of our participation,'' said <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON>. `` They simply must respect it, as we respect their principal means of struggle.'' He said political and military revolutionary leaders met in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, in mid-July to discuss electoral participation. `` Our position and our objectives were fully understood -LRB- by the guerrillas. -RRB-'' he said. The Convergence will go up against an incumbent party shattered by infighting and deteriorated by the exercise of power during years of crisis. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s promises of peace and increased well-being have gone unfulfilled. The Republican Nationalist Alliance, the main rightist opposition, is running on the full head of steam produced by its victories in March. The party, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, gained control of the legislature and two thirds of municipalities nationwide. The leftist political front could face its most difficult dilemma if no candidate in March receives more than 50 percent of the vote. That would require a second round with the top two finishers in the running. Most observers doubt either the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> will receive a majority in the first round. If the Convergence obtains around 10 percent of the vote, which is considered feasible, it could decide the outcome by casting its lot with one of the two major parties. <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON> said he believes abstention would be advisable in a second round. `` If we tie ourselves to the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, and they continue as they have been, we dirty our future,'' he said. `` And <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> represents the oligarchic past that brought the country to where it is now.''

<HEAD>Flattened in War, Dresden Still Struggling to Recapture Past</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DRESDEN, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The charred skeletons of a once magnificent city center still dominate <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>'s patchwork skyline of hasty postwar renewal and piecemeal restoration. City planners acknowledge and many <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> residents complain that the pace of restoration has been slowed because <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, has been given priority in rebuilding efforts <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, known as the `` German Florence'' before its almost total destruction in two days of Allied firebombing raids in 1945, is today a city of stark, often brutal contrasts. Viewed from the far end of the old <LOCATION> Augustus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Elbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the meticulously rebuilt Semper opera house, Roman Catholic cathedral and Zwinger Gallery stand next to the bombed-out and scorched ruins of the once majestic Royal Palace. Despite initial restoration efforts, the palace's crumbling and roofless facades remain in large part home for birds and overgrown vegetation. Featureless, Soviet-style housing and commercial blocks erected after World War II now dominate the city's main thoroughfares and plazas, interspersed with vast and idle spaces long since cleared of rubble. Most of the city's once fabled Baroque turrets and spires are gone. Nevertheless, city officials are fiercely proud of the restoration projects undertaken in recent years. But they say much work has been slowed because of lack of resources. Many grumbling Dresdeners blame the restoration delays and the widespread deterioration of many buildings that survived on poor planning and breakneck efforts to spruce up <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. More than 20,000 construction workers were ordered to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> last year to work on massive building projects as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials strove to compete with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s glitter during the city's 750th anniversary celebrations. East German officials, in an effort to make <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> a showcase, have diverted building materials and workers to the capital for years, leaving many provincial cities to struggle to find the means to restore thousands of crumbling buildings. <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Seltmann </PERSON>, an official in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>'s city administration responsible for culture, defended the allocation of resources. `` The capital city is the capital city,'' he said. Others say the city _ and the nation _ faced an awesome reconstruction task after World War II. `` You have to remember that this city was raised from 15 million cubic meters of total ruin,'' said <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON>, director general of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>'s 11 state musuems, referring to the firestorm that devastated the city Feb. 13-14, 1945. The destruction of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> in the final days of the war has prompted debate among military historians about the necessity of the raids at a time when the Soviet army was already rapidly advancing into <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The city, a communications and rail link, was swollen with refugees and estimates of the death toll have ranged from 35,000 to more than 135,000. The city and its destruction figured prominently in author <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Vonnegut </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s internationally acclaimed 1969 novel, `` Slaughterhouse Five.'' <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> said the devastation did not break the city's will to survive. `` <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> residents turned out to help rebuild the Zwinger Gallery when many of them still had no homes to return to.'' He added that the city had accomplished much, despite the subsequent shortages. He said city pride and a deep-rooted sense of cultural tradition has helped <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> recover much of its reputation as a city once legendary for its art, architecture and music. Most of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>'s art treasures escaped wartime destruction, <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> said, because they were hidden by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in more than 50 locations around the state of <LOCATION> Saxony </LOCATION>. Many were discovered in poor condition in a damp mine shaft by Soviet troops, <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> said. `` The Russians preserved them and returned them to us.'' He said more than 1,240 paintings were returned but about 500 works are still missing, including two Rembrandts. The treasures of the Saxon royalty, known as the <PERSON> Gruene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gewoelbe </PERSON>, also survived the the war intact and are on display at the state art gallery. The collection contains more than 3,000 stunningly crafted works in gold, silver, ivory, ebony, amber, brass, and bronze. Many are lavishly decorated with precious stones. <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> said he hoped shortages that have slowed restoration of the Royal Palace can be overcome and that work can be completed by the turn of the century. The palace will be the repository of many of the city's art treasures now in storage because of a lack of gallery space. But some of the city's most dramatic restoration achievements are already in peril because of air pollution. Heavily-laden diesel trucks and cars using oil-laced gasoline roar past Theater Square, belching clouds of exhaust fumes around the opera and <LOCATION> Zwinger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gallery </LOCATION>, coating the buildings with a film of grimy, black soot. Emissions from a coal-fired power plant not far away also threaten the sandstone and granite facades.

 With each month, evidence grows that mass psychology is playing as important a role in the economy's performance as more traditional factors, such as interest rates and inventories Perhaps the clearest manifestation shows up in the widespread belief that the expansion can not be sustained much longer, simply because it is almost 69 months old and is `` due'' to expire. The factor shows up in the latest quarterly economic survey by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, which found that small-business optimism lost ground, mainly because fewer companies expect continued growth. `` The longer the recovery goes, the larger the proportion of economic agents becomes which believes that the expansion can not be sustained,'' said Professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, who regularly interprets the findings. `` Apparently many believe that the law of gravity applies to economic statistics as well as apples,'' said <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of the graduate business school at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that companies have become `` decidedly less optimistic about future expansion each July, with 60 percent expecting growth in 1983 compared to 16 percent in 1988.'' Nevertheless, he declares in a report released today, `` There is no sign that the economy is poised to enter a recession.'' Reviewing detailed responses from 1,834 companies, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> noted that the decline in the survey's small-business optimism index resulted as much from disbelief about the likelihood of further growth as from strong negative views. In some parts of the country, he said, ` businesses just figure it ca n't get any better, so no improvement is expected.'' The survey's small-business optimism index fell to 100.5, seasonally adjusted, its lowest reading since the fourth quarter of 1986, when it registered 99.5. The base of 100 applies to economic conditions in 1978. Over the past 14 years, the index _ compiled from responses in 10 business categories, including expected business conditions, changes in earnings, and plans to hire _ has anticipated conditions six months away. Reviewing these categories, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> said imbalances that precede recession, such as rapid inflation, unusually strong inventory buildup, overly rapid capacity expansion, labor shortages and rising wages, were n't present. Some of the wage stability he attributed to an internationalization of labor markets, explaining that `` rising costs and wages in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> simply provide windows of opportunity for imports.'' Moreover, he continued, `` bottlenecks that historically produced rising prices are now alleviated by imports, which dramatically moderate price pressures. Worldwide, there are few if any identifiable capacity problems.'' In another reference to expectations affecting the economy's direction, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> commented on the widespread feeling that a recent rise in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> discount rate will slow the economy and prevent inflation `` If this occurs, it will be due to the psychological effects of the change and not the real impact of rising rates,'' he said. He explained that higher rates primarily will affect housing, but wo n't impact manufacturing. `` Only if higher interest rates produce a stronger dollar will demand in this sector be dampened,'' he said. Thus, he said, `` there is more hope than substance to the latest <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> move. But if everyone believes it is the correct policy, it is more likely that this will turn out to be the case.''

<HEAD>Back to School Trauma Looms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For millions of youngsters one of life's great experiences _ and great traumas _ is about to occur: The first day of school. This milestone adventure into foreign territory sets the stage for many years of schooling to come, and calm preparation by mom and dad can help ease the strain, federal educators report. The government has put together a little booklet entitled `` Plain Talk About When Your Child Starts School,'' which is available at no charge. Write the Consumer Information Center, <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, 81009 and ask for booklet 505T. You'll also get a catalog including a list of several other booklets with information on helping kids cope with school. These are available free or at low cost. In the meantime, though, educators stress the importance of preparing a first-time student for school in advance. But, they add, `` do n't make a federal case out of it.'' Children should be informed ahead of time that they will be starting school, but do n't make it a topic of daily conversation during the summer. Treat starting school as part of the normal course of life, something everyone does, including your youngster. Children will likely have questions about school, and educators urge answering them honestly. Especially important are letting the child know how many days school will last, how many hours per day, how they will get back and forth to school, what they will do after school and so forth. Explain patiently. Older children seem to enjoy frightening younger ones, so be aware that this can happen. Take the older child aside and explain their responsibility to help the younger one attend school without fear. Educators stress that it is important not to give the impression that there is any choice about going to school. It is normal for children to say things like `` I'm not going'' or `` they ca n't make me go.'' Remain calm and be reassuring, but explain that all children must go to school. Do n't argue or waiver, just be matter-of-fact and calm about school. It does help to give the child some control about things, such as asking if they want to wear sneakers or shoes, and what fruit or other desert they would like packed in their lunch. That can help communicate to the child that you appreciate the effort they are making to do what is being asked, say educators. Also, the departure of a child to school creates extra free time for many parents, time they may enjoy having. Do n't tell the child how much fun you'll be having when they are away. While the first few days of school are unique, try to develop a routine at home to make the event seem relatively normal. Starting school may be special, but it is n't on a par with <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON>'s first solo across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. All the best planning and preparation notwithstanding, when the final moment comes the child may balk. If this happens, educators say, fight back the annoyance and send the child to school. If tears flow it is usually at the moment of separation. After that, things usually settle down. Many a parent has spent a miserable day worrying about a child who quickly recovered and spent a fine first day at school. Fearful behavior will usually disappear within a few days, when the child begins to feel comfortable away from home, has learned to trust the teacher and makes some new friends. And mastery of the new situation can be an important success for the child, who is helped to feel better about himself or herself and more secure in the world.

<DATELINE>SANTA MARIA DEL ORO, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration law went into effect last year, this town in <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION> cattle country 500 miles south of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, feared for its future. For nearly half a century, it had supplied Mexicans who worked legally or illegally in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and sent home the dollars that helped keep the town going. But the catastrophe <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oro </ORGANIZATION> braced for 14 months ago has n't happened. Thousands of dollars still pour in every day, in money orders sent by residents' relatives working, most of them illegally, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Epifanio </PERSON> <PERSON> Carreon </PERSON> had feared the flow of dollars would dry up and, worse, hundreds of young men would come home looking for jobs that do n't exist. `` We would have seen at least some economic affects of the law by now, but everything is totally normal,'' <PERSON> Carreon </PERSON> says now. `` The dollar continues being the most important source of income in this region,'' said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON>, assistant manager of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internacional </ORGANIZATION>, the only bank in the area people that cashes dollar checks. `` Some people returned because of fear before they knew what was going to happen with the law. But now things are back to normal.'' One young man in town said, however, he's waiting to see what happens with the law _ the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Immigration Control and Reform Act _ before he attempts his first crossing. `` If it were n't for the law I'd already be in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocha </PERSON>, 18, who just graduated from a technical school here. He said two of his brothers already there had applied for amnesty under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law and fear they'll lose out if they harbor him as an illegal alien. `` If my brothers will let me, I'll go in spite of the law,'' said <PERSON> Rocha </PERSON>. `` Here you work so hard and you do n't make much.'' <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Oro </PERSON> has supplied the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor market with a steady stream of workers since World War II. Many residents went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as farm workers under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bracero program of 1942, said Mayor <PERSON> Carreon </PERSON>. By now, some have gained <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship or legal residency. By the time the program was dropped in 1964, many local residents had grown accustomed to having a steady job and earning dollars. Besides, said <PERSON> Carreon </PERSON>, the local gold and mining operations were winding down and there was n't much left to do here but work in the fields or raise cattle. The only major employer around these days is a lumber company, which has about 300 workers. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, the municipal clerk, estimates that more than 30 percent of the town's 14,000 people still go back and forth to jobs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Authorities estimate the percentage of people on surrounding farms and ranches with relatives working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is as high or even higher. <PERSON> Carreon </PERSON> said the steady flow of dollars _ as much as $ 60,000 a week _ has helped <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oro </LOCATION> weather <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 6-year-old economic crisis. Indeed, by Mexican standards <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Oro </PERSON> is well off. The main streets are filled with late-model <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican pickup trucks, many bearing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> license plates. There are no beggars on the streets. Many of the homes and businesses were financed with dollars. Residents and public officials here say the law has helped those who hve been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for a long time and wanted to stay there. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> returned several years ago and bought a butcher shop with the money he earned as an undocumented worker in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. His brother, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> butcher, stayed and has applied for amnesty, the provision of the law allowing foreigners who meet certain requirements to seek legal residency. `` He feels a lot safer knowing that when he leaves the house -LRB- in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> -RRB- he'll return,'' <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. Illegal aliens caught in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> most often are deported immediately. For others who did n't qualify for amnesty under the law or just did n't bother to apply, it's business as usual: a sundown trek across the border. `` We'll stay as long as there's work. When there's not we'll come back crying,'' said <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, 29, who has worked in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as an undocumented worker for a decade `` Right now the work is there waiting for us,'' said <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, one of three brothers working without documents at a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> construction company. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, home on vacation, said the $ 21 an hour he earns makes the risk of crossing as an illegal alien worthwhile. Similar work in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> probably would pay him about $ 12 a day. `` Right now it -LRB- the law -RRB- has n't affected us at all,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' 18-year-old brother who began working illegally in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when he was 14. The toughest provision of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law went into effect this past June 1, making it illegal for most employers to knowingly hire undocumented workers. The law calls for stiff fines and even jail sentences for violators. Agricultural workers now in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been given an extension to Dec. 1 to get their papers in order or leave. Although crossing the border without legal documents is the risky part, those who've worked in the same job in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since before 1982 do n't have to show employers their documents.

 <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chan </PERSON>, the successor to the legendary chop and drop king <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s top action film star, has yet to crack the American market but insists he has more to offer than <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> `` Rambo'' <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>. `` I think I am far better than him _ I dare say it straight to his face _ because I can do things he can, but he ca n't do things I can,'' the baby-faced <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> boasted in a recent interview. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON>, 34, is famous throughout <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> for the death-defying stunts liberally sprinkled throughout his movies, and he pooh-poohs the `` Rambo'' series because <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> does n't attempt such exploits. `` We see the cave explode and then there he is, appearing on top of another hill. Really, Rambo,'' he said. `` I only do what I really can, something an ordinary man can not do but a trained man can. This is me,'' <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said, proudly tapping his chest. In the 1987 film `` Project A II,'' <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> jumped from a 50-foot clock tower to the concrete ground through two flimsy canvases. It was a typical example of his work. Such stunts, however, do n't come without bruises. In July, he knocked himself out during a scene in which he somersaulted on top of a moving bus before smashing through a billboard. The combination of stunts and humor in <LOCATION> Chan </LOCATION>'s movies have made him a smash box-office success in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, with his last 10 movies earning more than $ 150 million in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. At the same time, Jackie-mania is ever present. When he appeared for a promotion in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in March, 800 fans turned up, and he topped a list of idols in a survey of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> teen-agers released in February. In 1987, a Japanese woman moved to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to serve him tea in his studio every day. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> made her his floor manager, a move that drove dozens more Japanese women to fly to the British colony. Another woman, 24-year-old <PERSON> Reiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mimura </PERSON>, moved here from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in 1984 to be closer to her idol. `` I just looked at him and felt very nervous. He was nice and gave me his records with his autograph,'' she recalled of a meeting two years ago. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON>, a muscular 5-foot-10, said he does not dare have a lover or a wife for fear of driving his fans to despair. Two girls reportedly tried to kill themselves over the actor. But despite his wild popularity in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, his efforts to impress <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> moviegoers have been disappointing. He has appeared in five American movies, including `` Battle Creek Brawl'' and `` The Cannonball Run.'' <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> was not happy with the movies, and said he would like to do a film with <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> _ free of charge if necessary. `` I need an opportunity _ a great director who wants to make a movie about <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people to hire me,'' <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said. `` The audience will want to see any film by that director, and when they happen to see me in the movie they'll say, ` Hey, this <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> is cool.''' With no offers from <LOCATION> Spielberg </LOCATION>, however, <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> plans to star in a self-directed movie in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next year. `` If the Americans like it, OK. If not, forget it,'' he said. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in 1954 to parents who emigrated to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> six years later. They enrolled <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> to study acting, acrobatics and martial arts. He appeared in a few films before leaving the institute to work as a stuntman. After kung fu star <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s death in 1974, director <PERSON> Lo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> picked <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> as a new talent. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON>'s career was launched in the 1976 film `` New Fist of Fury'' in which he imitated <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. More than 10 similar films quickly followed, but not until the 1978 `` Drunken Monkey in a Tiger's Eye'' did <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> find his own style of action-comedy. In 1985, <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> cracked his skull in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> while shooting a scene in which he was to leap from a castle onto a tree. Instead, he fell 50 feet to the ground, fracturing his skull and driving a splinter into his brain. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> underwent brain surgery and hearing in his right ear remains impaired. `` I never thought it would happen to me,'' he said. `` While I was lying in the hospital I thought a lot and found there are many things I have not done.'' The accident was a turning point in his life. When he returned to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, he set up a charity foundation, participated in anti-drug campaigns and ran marathons for charity. `` Now I think more positively,'' he said. `` If I want to do something, I'll do it quickly. It's not that I'm afraid I may not live through tomorrow, but I do n't want to have any regrets.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Biotechnology has begun to do amazing things with what seems the very stuff of life and evolution, and an industry to exploit the researchers' successes has taken shape. The potential seems enormous. So, to some at least, is the risk of unexpected consequences. That's what a determined crusader has focused on, to much controversy.

 A scientist sprays genetically altered bacteria onto a strawberry patch. A mouse with a man-made predisposition to breast cancer scurries about a university lab. A pig with a human growth hormone gene grows bigger and faster than its brother. Many cheer. Others worry. For some, genetic manipulation threatens deeply held religious beliefs. For others, it's the thought of mutant organisms run amok. For still others, fresh images of disaster _ the orange flames of <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, the forked tongue of smoke from the Challenger _ cloud the promise of bright technological frontiers. In courtrooms and congressional hearings, in the media and on college campuses, the man who speaks most fervently to such uneasiness is <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, biotechnology's leading gadfly. He is not widely revered among scientists. `` In the Industrial Age, our parents did n't ask questions. It was the age of progress and efficiency, and there were no limits,'' <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> says. `` Scientists said ` trust us.' Industrialists were hellbent on change, i.e. profits. Policy leaders were wildly enthused. There was a utopian mentality. `` A child believes there are no consequences for his acts. We've had a childlike consciousness Now, with the new scientific technology, the changes are so impactful we ca n't afford that childlike mentality. It's time to raise fundamental questions.'' He speaks quickly, a rush of words barely audible over the drone of a copier, the lone concession to electronics in the otherwise resolutely low-tech office of the Foundation on Economic Trends. The outer room, crammed with young interns and old chairs, resembles the headquarters for an embattled political campaign. In a sense, it is. From this modest command post, a handful of lawyers, policy researchers and interns fire shots sometimes heard round the nation. They aim at all manner of targets: Genetic engineering. Animal patenting. Commercialized childbearing. Bovine growth hormone. Biological warfare. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, the foundation's president, is 43, a small man trim from years of swimming a mile every night at the Y. His brown eyes radiate warmth and good humor; the vision of a civilization bent on engineering its own demise is a burden that rests on him lightly, at least outwardly. He has no shortage of critics among scientists, who dismiss his arguments as unscientific and his writing as anti-intellectual. Opponents stress <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>'s lack of credentials _ he's had no formal science training _ and describe him as a nuisance. But a few concede that, along with their blood pressure, he also raises some important points. His talent lies in bringing prominent people together in alliances such as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surrogacy </ORGANIZATION>, composed of feminists, lawyers and 17 former surrogates including <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, to hold news conferences, testify before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and generally stir up the public. Other foundation staffers specialize in lawsuits such as the 1984 action that has delayed construction of a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> germ warfare laboratory at the Dugway Proving Ground in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The Army's considering scaling down the proposed facility or putting it elsewhere, among other choices. They also circulate petitions, such as the June 13 request to Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to halt the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s longstanding practice of shipping deadly experimental viruses through the mail. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> concurred. A 1983 lawsuit by <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>'s organization stalled tests of a frost-inhibiting microbe on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> for four years before a state court of appeals judge finally gave the go-ahead. Another suit prompted the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to deny a permit to <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> for a test of a gene-altered microbial corn pesticide. <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> eventually abandoned the project. Last May, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agreed to curtail testing at electromagnetic pulse simulator facilities in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> until environmental, health and safety matters can be documented. EMPs are electromagnetic pulses that travel at speeds of light to simulate those generated by high-altitude nuclear explosions. The agreement came in response to another <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> suit charging potential environmental and human health risks. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>'s foundation was also instrumental in exposing two biotech cases involving violations. One concerned a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company that conducted outdoor tests of a genetically engineered chemical before receiving a permit. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> accused the company, <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, of falsifying the data to indicate the tests had taken place indoors. In the other, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, without first consulting other regulatory agencies, allowed <ORGANIZATION> Biologics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, to test and market a genetically altered vaccine for pigs. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in an editorial called the foundation `` an unrelenting watchdog of genetic engineering'' that `` deserves credit for bringing to light these two cases and what they show about the ragged federal system for regulating the new technology.'' Not all <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> campaigns succeed. Two recent suits challenging government regulation of genetic engineering were dismissed by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> judge who ruled it had no legal standing to sue. A genetically engineered mouse can still be patented the same as a mousetrap, although legislation has been introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> calling for moratoriums on animal patenting. Deliberate environmental releases of various genetically engineered viruses and bacteria are planned over the next several years.

 The <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rejected a petition demanding an environmental impact statement on bovine growth hormone, charging it `` will damage the environment, cause unnecessary suffering to cows, and wreak havoc on the dairy economy.''

It is the <ORGANIZATION> RAC </ORGANIZATION>'s job to draft safety guidelines for conducting genetic engineering research and to decide whether potentially hazardous research should be carried out. <ORGANIZATION> RAC </ORGANIZATION>'s guidelines are mandatory for government-sponsored research; private industry has agreed to follow them voluntarily. `` When someone opposes every new development, when he takes an extreme view on every issue, you have to wonder. Sometimes the person standing on the periphery is a pioneer. But every issue?'' Moreover, <PERSON> McGarrity </PERSON> adds, `` He operates on a very limited scientific basis.'' He recalls that <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> once opposed a vaccine being developed against an organism that causes diarrhea. `` He feared it could be used in biological warfare,'' <PERSON> McGarrity </PERSON> says. `` In fact, we wanted to use it as a vaccine in developing countries where diarrhea is a problem for thousands of children.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottesman </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> RAC </ORGANIZATION> member, says that <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> `` does n't address science at all. <PERSON> Gottesman </PERSON> is chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Biochemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s Lab of Molecular Biology and a consultant to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on biotech matters. `` He makes absolute statements which sound scary, and he uses discussion points which are sure to appeal as you hear them,'' says <PERSON> Gottesman </PERSON>, who has debated <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> on television. `` It's hard for the public to understand the science and the real difference between something that's scary and something that's not.'' Those views are echoed by others, who invariably single out `` Algeny,'' one of the nine books <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> has written -LRB- each in longhand on yellow legal pads -RRB-, for their harshest criticism. The author, an economics major who has had no formal science training, describes `` Algeny'' as `` a thoughtful and studied critique of the philosophy of modern science and technology.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> biologist, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, called it `` a cleverly constructed tract of anti-intellectual propaganda masquerading as scholarship.'' `` Among books promoted as intellectual statements by important thinkers, I do n't think I have ever read a shoddier work,'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> wrote in 1985. `` Damn shame, too, because the deep issue is troubling and I do not disagree with <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>'s basic plea for respecting the integrity of evolutionary lineages.'' <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> does have a measure of support even among scientists, however. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, a developmental biologist at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledges inaccuracies in <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>'s writings, but says, `` I see him more as an Old Testament prophet who raises important issues that go beyond expertise. `` I believe technology should be developed and fostered, but there are other important issues. Society has a stake in making sure the technologies are used safely and ethically. From that perspective, I do think <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> has performed a service by keeping the issues of appropriate use of biotechnology in the public eye.'' <PERSON> Liebe </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavalieri </PERSON> of Sloan-Kettering Institute in <LOCATION> Rye </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, is a molecular biologist whose work with DNA dates to the discovery by <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Crick </PERSON> of the double helix 35 years ago. <PERSON> Cavalieri </PERSON> acknowledges `` soft spots'' in `` Algeny,'' but says scientists who dismiss his arguments as strictly emotional are `` throwing dust around.'' `` Most scientists are trained not to think in broad, global ways and can not see the possible outcome of this or that technology in terms of societal impact. It's very difficult to get out of the mold of scientist. We're trained in reductionist thinking,'' he says. `` But we have at our disposal methodology which can disrupt living systems ... And I'm afraid we're not being selective. `` We're not going to get a plague next week because somebody released some nitrogen-fixing bacteria,'' <PERSON> Cavalieri </PERSON> adds. `` The issue is much more subtle, and in a way, more dangerous. The effects will take place over time.'' Those subtle, long-term effects are at the heart of <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>'s crusade He's not worried about killer tomatoes. He is worried about applying engineering principles to living things at the expense of traditional human values. `` It's called genetic engineering because it's about engineering genes, taking engineering principles and applying them to the blueprint of every aspect of life,'' he says.

 `` Control, predictability of outcome, reductionism, utilitarianism and efficiency. Those are the values we have come to covet as important. `` The philosophy of using genetic engineering is to improve a species. So what criteria do we use to determine what are functional genes? Who should have that authority? Would you trust the president? The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>? The National Academy of Science? Would you trust GE or the marketplace? `` Two value systems are in confrontation: the ancient value of our sacred relationship to the rest of creation and our desire to reduce everything to utilitarian standards.'' These would be tough times for scientists even without <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>. Long accustomed to working in good faith, researchers increasingly find themselves assailed by creationists, animal rights activists and others. Close scrutiny by one's colleagues is one thing; surveillance by a suspicious, scientifically unschooled public is something else. A biotechnology symposium at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> last fall gave a glimpse of scientists' mounting frustrations at finding their experiments hamstrung by what they called `` biological McCarthyism'' or `` the ` tomato-that-ate-Hollywood' syndrome.'' The symposium came in the wake of field tests of `` ice-minus'' bacteria by researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. The test involved the release of genetically altered microbes. Placed on crops, the microbes help prevent frost from forming. Scientists generally agreed that testing the microbes on strawberry and potato plants presented no danger. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> and others feared the microbes could mutate to cause human disease. Lawsuits and protests followed. Ultimately, vandals tore up plants at both test sites. `` Everybody involved with ice-minus has had such a horrendous time with the controversy that they're all burned out,'' one scientist said. Some scientists who have reservations about aspects of biotechnology feel that to say so would be counterproductive. `` There are n't many societies that give science the free rein it's had here,'' biologist <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> says. `` It's a precious thing, and it relies on good will. Scientists are very reluctant to sour that.'' Genetic engineering technology involves manipulating the DNA, the basic substance of heredity of living organisms. By moving DNA between different organisms, researchers hope to develop more productive plants and treat genetic diseases. They also hope to create new drugs, one application of genetics that <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> does not oppose. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> is among a handful of experts who are beginning to express scientific as well as ethical doubts about genetic engineering. He believes the strong drive to commercialize new techniques of manipulating genetic material has given rise to distorted views about biotechnology's potential. `` The standard view holds that biologists have ` cracked the code of life' and are now poised to ` genetically reprogram' damaged or unsuitable life forms,'' he wrote in a recent issue of Perspectives in Biology and Medicine. `` But the most that can be claimed for DNA on the basis of present knowledge is that it specifies some of the ingredients that make up an organism's cells. DNA does not function as a ` command center' or ` blueprint' for the functioning of those cells, as has sometimes been stated ... `` The concept nonetheless continues to flourish in textbooks, in the popular media, and in corporate handouts, as a confidently worn mask that obscures the primitive state of our understanding of the biological world.'' The notion of `` genetic programming,'' intended as metaphor, is now taken literally, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> says, resulting in serious misconceptions of the status and potential of biotechnology on the part of scientists and non-scientists alike. `` Since each gene contributes to thousands of traits, and each trait is the result of the interaction of thousands of genes, all we can do is make minor modifications and hope for the best.'' Separating good genes from bad is far more complicated than most people realize, he adds. The same recessive gene linked to development of one disease _ sickle cell anemia, for example _ also protects against another _ malaria. Clearly, `` the nature of this material is very different from what we're used to working with in building and engineering,'' says <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. He characterizes current knowledge of the relationship between an organism's DNA and its overt characteristics as `` meager.'' To <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, biotechnology is unfolding in a manner all too reminiscent of other technical and scientific developments that have suddenly come to exact an unexpected price. He points to a magazine cover story about the greenhouse effect, the gradual heating of the planet scientists say will result from the destruction of the ozone layer in the atmosphere that protects against the sun's ultraviolet rays. `` This is the bill for the industrial age,'' he says, brandishing the magazine. `` It lasted 200 years and we'll pay for it for 2,000. `` Now we're about to run out of fossil fuels and enter the age of renewable resources. This is the time to raise the issues _ like patenting animals. It's as if, 100 years ago, we divided up the oil and coal, the resources for the industrial age. Now we're dividing up the resources for the age of biotechnology. `` Science and technology initiatives dramatically affect the future. We ca n't be passive. The 21st century is being defined now. We're determined to help shape it before it becomes a fait accompli.''

 For <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, the combat against biotechnology is the latest in a series of battles that have helped shape a varied life and career. He's fought tougher. He was born weighing 2 -LCB- pounds. His birth, midway through the sixth month of <PERSON> Vivette </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>'s pregnancy, was n't the only surprise Mrs. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> was about to be wheeled out of the delivery room when a doctor detected a second baby. `` Our chances of survival were something like zero,'' says <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>. Other than being smaller than most high school freshmen, and the occasional schoolyard thrashings that went with it, he suffered no permanent ill effects. <PERSON> Jerelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> was less fortunate. An error in regulating the flow of oxygen to her incubator robbed her of most of her sight. Now married and a mother of three, she remains legally blind, although `` she does everything everyone else does,'' says her brother. `` She's probably the best-adjusted person in my family.'' Her daughter's handicap inspired <PERSON> Vivette </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> to found Educational Tape Recording for the <PERSON> Blind </PERSON>, a volunteer organization now in its 20th year of recording textbooks for blind students. At 77, she still works a seven-day week as its president. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> is retired from his job as a plastic bag manufacturer. They've lived in the same house for 43 years, in a working-class neighborhood on the south side of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Growing up with a handicapped twin prompted <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> to give a great deal of thought at an early age to weighty social issues. He still does. `` In this society, the highest compliment is to turn out generations of productive human beings. You have to have productivity, of course. But a lot of us grow up believing the highest value is to be productive, like a machine is productive,'' he says. `` That does a disservice. What matters most is to turn out caring human beings, people who have the higher value of empathy.'' By the time he graduated from high school, about the time he finally caught up to his classmates, <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> had come to believe that an ordinary person can accomplish extraordinary things, a notion reinforced by his acceptance, despite flunking high school English, to an <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> college. Twenty-five years and nine books later, he says, `` I still ca n't tell you which is the adverb.'' As a beer-drinking fraternity man at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, he was `` very rah-rah, a cheerleader,'' says <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Borenstein </PERSON>, his college roommate. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> was `` never enthralled with high-tech,'' adds his roommate. When most college kids were preoccupied with rock music, <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> was busy organizing a nostalgia show of'50s kiddie programs. Even then, his organizational skills were impressive: `` He filled the auditorium, and the show was a huge success.'' His politics took a sharp turn to the left in 1966, when a Vietnamese history course `` did n't square with what they were saying on TV.'' The following year, he made waves nationwide as the first senior class president of an <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> college to publicly denounce the war. After graduation, he attended the <ORGANIZATION> Fletcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> and Diplomacy at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION>, then became a VISTA volunteer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, working with welfare recipients in <LOCATION> Bedford-Stuyvesant </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. During the'70s, he organized the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bicentennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, `` an alternative to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s Tory celebrations,'' he says. The commission held rallies for `` economic democracy'' and churned out classroom materials celebrating the nation's revolutionary past By 1977, <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> had found his next cause in the controversy over recombinant DNA technology, the subject of his new book, `` Who Should Play God.'' The same year, he led protesters in disrupting a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> meeting on DNA research, chanting `` We will not be cloned.'' In the years since, both <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>'s techniques and his targets have grown more complex. These days, in addition to campaigns against animal patenting, biological warfare and surrogacy, another form of tinkering with life, he's preparing a global boycott of milk treated with bovine growth hormone, a Greenhouse Effect Coalition and `` we'd like to move big on electronic pollution.'' For all his public pronouncements on technology's ills, `` I'm not a purist,'' <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> concedes He owns a condo, drives a <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, and is a faithful viewer of `` thirtysomething'' and `` Cheers.'' He's clearly proud of the favorable reviews he's receiving for his college speaking engagements -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> called him `` a rare bird _ a first-rate speaker and a first-rate writer'' -RRB-. At the same time, no amount of criticism directed at him or his politics seems to faze him. `` I've known him a long time,'' says <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, who has lent support to <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>'s campaign against animal patenting. `` He's very determined, very sincere, and he's on the issue for the long run.'' `` I'm an average person with an average background,'' says <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, who believes average people are quite capable of changing history.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Back in 1964, a man running for the White House could still bring his campaign to the people without a vast apparatus of hired image-shapers, consultants, security forces _ anxious glances at the latest quickie polls to tell him what to say. Perhaps one of the last candidates to present himself largely unencumbered was <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. An AP reporter who covered this and many another run for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> recalls how it felt in simpler times.

 <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>'s was the last of the freestyle presidential campaigns, innocent of consultants, short on security men, played in person instead of on television _ and seldom inhibited by any real prospect of winning the White House. That made it a perfect fit for the senator from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The Secret Service would have cramped his style, and he undoubtedly would have fired the kind of campaign consultants who manage campaigns these days. In 1964, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> worked with people he knew and trusted, not hired hands. He said what he thought, which sometimes changed over the course of a campaign day. He was accused of shooting from the hip, but he was n't always that careful. For all that, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>'s 1964 campaign was candid, generally honest, short on rancor despite the bitterness of some of his most ardent supporters, and remarkably prophetic. Latter-day legend notwithstanding, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> dug many of his own political traps before he became a presidential candidate. His notions about selling <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> and turning Social Security into a voluntary system are samples: Both proposals were made in pieces he wrote as Mr. Conservative, not Mr. Candidate. Actually, he tempered them during the campaign, although he liked to reminisce about the blunt way he'd talked in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> about Social Security and in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> about <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>. He repeated the proposals, but he also said that he did n't believe in changing contracts like Social Security, and that, besides, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would n't let any president make that system voluntary or sell off <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>. It was a simpler time and, too briefly, a safer time. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had been assassinated, an event that deformed the politics of 1964. But that was an aberration. Secret Service agents were not deployed around candidates until more than four years later, after <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had fallen to assassins. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> traveled with <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Justice </PERSON>, an automobile dealer he'd met in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> motorcade, as his sole security man during the presidential primaries. Since 1968, the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> cocoon has enveloped candidates, limiting access, controlling crowds, and often keeping voters away in the name of security. Not that <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> was a glad-hander. He sometimes seemed annoyed when crowds kept him overtime. One night an unexpected crowd of supporters turned up to cheer him as his chartered plane arrived in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> snapped a demand to know who on his staff was responsible for that. `` I'm no baby-kissing, back-slapping, blintzel-eating politician,'' he said one day in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>. That was intended as a slap at his arch rival, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, the Eastern Republican incarnate. Rocky, of course, delighted in being all of the above. And, like any <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> politician, he knew how to say `` blintz.'' In <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, an over-zealous <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> supporter marched <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> into the Puritain Restaurant to shake hands at lunch time. The senator did n't stay long. `` If somebody walked up to me while I was eating and stuck out his hand, I'd put a hamburger in it,'' <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> said. He was a Westerner who liked guns. Security people do not like guns around their candidates. One can only speculate at the reaction had the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> been on hand when <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> decided to fire a few shots across his driveway toward <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, into a bullet trap he sometimes missed. He did just that one day after entertaining a group of reporters at lunch at his home. One of them liked pistols as much as the senator did, and <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> invited him to join in target practice. This proved exciting for the rest of the party, still chatting with Mrs. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> when the gunfire began, out of the front door, one room away. `` It's just <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> with his pistol,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, thinking to calm her guests. She made him stop shooting. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> acknowledged it probably was just as well because some of his shots had strayed into the valley below, and it seemed to bother the people at the church down there. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> also liked airplanes, as pilot and as passenger. His campaign jet was named `` <PERSON> Yia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kin </PERSON>,'' Navajo for House in the Sky. It was one of the first of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 jets that now are a staple of world aviation. The senator flew it, although nobody ever admitted that. He also landed it when he arrived at <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after the election. He brought it down hard and smiled knowingly when a reporter told him the third bounce landing was a nice one although the first had been rather exciting.

<HEAD>UNDATED: rather exciting.</HEAD>

 It was at least that exciting when the <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> charter performed the <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> Flyby early in the campaign. The 727 took off from <LOCATION> Tri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cities </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and leveled off en route to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. Suddenly the plane turned sharply and dove at high speed. Grown pilots _ and there were a lot in the <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> entourage _ paled. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, up front, went into the cockpit and came back smiling. The plane kept diving toward the ground then, suddenly, leveled off and blazed down the runway at control tower level. A pilot's prank. `` That was to separate the men from the boys,'' <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> said. Consistency was not a hobgoblin of the <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> campaign. One morning in <LOCATION> Laconia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, during the primary campaign, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> said he would be inclined to withdraw from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> if Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were seated. One stop later he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must stay in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Another stop, and he said that if the mainland Chinese supplanted the Nationalists, it would blow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation to pieces. Then, that evening: `` I've never said let's get out of the U.N. I do n't know how that rumor ever got started.'' At an American Legion convention in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> likened <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Izvestia </LOCATION>. Outside, he chatted with a group of reporters and took pains to tell <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON>, the Times reporter who covered his campaign, that it was n't personal. `` I did n't mean you, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, I meant them,'' he said. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>'s partisans despised reporters, particularly Eastern reporters. A reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> arranged for two sets of press badges. One read `` Eastern Liberal Press.'' The other read `` Western Tory Press.'' The safe course was to grab one of each. The Vietnam War was taking shape during 1964 _ the purported attack on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessels in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> came in August, after <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> had been nominated. Long before that happened, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> warned that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> had the makings of the long, agonizing conflict it became. In an unlikely setting, amid acres of blossoming pear orchards in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that spring, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> could become a far more serious conflict than <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He said President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> should tell the nation of the peril, and of his plans for the future. At that time, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement was limited to aid and advisers. Combat forces came later. Still grappling with the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> issue that fall, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> announced that if elected he would ask former President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> to go to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and recommend future policy. It was an ironic echo of <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s own promise, in 1952, that if elected, he would go to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The problem was that nobody bothered to tell <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> what <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> was about to propose. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> never liked <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, and it only heightened his frustration at the Democratic president's landslide lead, in polls borne out by the election. Besides, the Democratic president kept mousetrapping the Republican nominee. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That landmark law, and the threat of a white backlash, were backdrop realities during the campaign. The senator said he did n't want them to become divisive issues. A reporter asked whether he had talked with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> about that concern. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> had n't, but he would. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> grabbed that opening the instant he learned of it. He said he'd meet with <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> any time. They met, at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, on <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s turf and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s terms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s people then crafted a joint statement which said in effect that the president would continue to take the high road on civil rights, and the Republcan nominee had finally agreed not to make an issue of it. On election eve, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> went north to his `` good luck town,'' <LOCATION> Fredonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> border, in Indian country. He'd wound up his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaigns there, and it would be the last stop on his presidential campaign, too. One reporter made it his mission to record for posterity the last words spoke in the campaign. They were not memorable. They were: `` And if there are any Paiutes out there, I want to thank you, too.'' In 1964, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had seen three presidents, <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, hold office within four years. The voters were n't about to install a fourth, even had there been a Republican nominee with wider support than <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> found. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> knew the odds when he hobbled into the campaign, his foot in a cast after one bone spur surgery. On election night, 1964, at the Camel Back Inn, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>'s staff set up a giant blackboard to record the popular and electoral vote, state by state. From the time the first votes were counted, the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> landslide was evident. Nobody bothered to write a number on the big blackboard. Chalk never touched it, all night long.

 FREER, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ Eight miles west of Freer, an arched gateway marks the entrance to the remote <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Manges </PERSON> calls home. The ranch is called The Magic Kingdom. He is called the Desert Fox. The house itself is big and luxurious and open, with the kitchen set apart by a circular bar and the living area anchored by a magnificent fireplace. It is a warm and friendly desert hideaway for a person once described as brilliant, backward, brash, bashful and ruthless. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Manges </PERSON> also has been portrayed as persecuted, powerful, generous, ignorant, lucky, shy and misunderstood. Today, <LOCATION> Manges </LOCATION> is highly agitated and just a little combative. A <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> bank wants to foreclose on his 100,000-acre ranch to settle a $ 53 million debt and the local school district is demanding $ 1.5 million in back taxes. There are other lawsuits, other creditors, other unpaid bills and other miseries stemming from his ownership of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gunslingers </ORGANIZATION> of the ill-fated <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. But what irks Manges as much as anything is that he wants a new car and ca n't get it, despite assets of perhaps several hundred million dollars. His credit and current cash flow are zilch. `` There's not a bank in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that will loan me 15 cents,'' he grumbles as he guides a visitor around his ranch and past herds of deer, buffalo and cattle. `` I've been on a cash basis for five years. `` When they cut off all your blood, somewhere down the line you're supposed to die. But I did n't.'' In the <LOCATION> Manges </LOCATION> mind, `` they'' are a conspiratorial mix of big banks, big law firms, big oil and big insurance companies. `` They'' are the establishment, the power structure. `` They control 95 percent of the wealth in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' he snorted, `` and they make the politics. `` Some of the things they've done to me should n't happen to a dog.'' Who is <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Manges </PERSON>? The answer depends on who you ask. `` A liar and a fraud,'' says <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, a former friend and legal counsel who once sued <ORGANIZATION> Manges </ORGANIZATION> for $ 20 million in a flap over the Gunslingers. It was also <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> who said: `` He has a degree of raw courage. He's quick. He's tough. He's the best trader I've ever seen.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>: `` He's very tough and very shrewd. I doubt that you could ever apply enough heat to force him to his knees. He'll fight you till his last breath.'' <PERSON> A.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeese </PERSON>, retired chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, now MBank: `` A classic subject for publicity _ a poor boy, with little formal education, scaling heights so few people ever reach.'' State Comptroller <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, a longtime <LOCATION> Manges </LOCATION> friend and political ally: `` I love the man. He is one of the most generous people I've known, and not only with money, but time.'' Land Commissioner <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON>, a remorseful recipient of Manges campaign largesse: `` He lives in a fantasy world in his Magic Kingdom, and I do n't have the key to the kingdom ... If I never see <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Manges </PERSON> again, I'll be better off.'' Freer car dealer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>: `` He's in his realm when he's in a courtroom fighting a case.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON>: `` To be a capitalist, you've got to have a little larceny in your heart, and I think he's probably got a little larceny in his heart. He's been an underdog, and he likes to help underdogs. I like him.'' <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Manges </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>'s wife of 42 years and mother of the couple's four adopted children: `` Everybody in town knows who he is. But they do n't know him.'' In 1974, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> newspapers speculated that a `` rags to riches'' rancher named <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Manges </PERSON> might seize the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> power base of troubled political boss <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Parr </PERSON>, the legendary <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Parr </PERSON> later killed himself. In 1984, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Monthly concluded that the newspaper prophecy had come to pass. The magazine described Manges as corrupt and manipulative, a convicted felon who was reluctant to py his bills. Yet, the article conceded: `` His mystique and money have combined to make him the most powerful _ and most controversial _ behind-the-scenes figure in current <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> politics ... `` No one else has so much influence.'' Manges angrily dismissed the article as a `` hatchet job.'' Regarding the crime itself, a false statement on a 1959 Small Business loan application, <ORGANIZATION> Manges </ORGANIZATION> friend <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, father of the state's senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, contended that the indictment `` should never have been brought and was only sustained on a technicality.'' At 64, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Manges </PERSON> is hefty and balding, with muscular arms and a round face creased by sun, wind, sand and stress. He often speaks in rapid spurts, like bursts from a machine gun.

 `` Despite what they call me,'' said <PERSON> Manges </PERSON>, pouring gravy over freshly fried quail, `` I'm not a kingmaker or a power broker. But I have helped a lot of people.'' He said it was no secret that he funneled nearly $ 1 million into the 1982 state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary through a political action cmmittee headed by <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> and called Texans for Good Government. But, he smiled, he actually spent about $ 3 million in that election, much of it earmarked for a wide range of liberal Democrats. `` The PAC money they know about,'' he said. `` What else I did, nobody knows.'' Whatever he did, it was money well spent. His candidates captured several of the state's top offices, judgeships and legislative seats. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> is now attorney general, <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> is land commissioner, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> is state comptroller and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> is agriculture commissioner. All could move up in 1990, when <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> most likely will run for governor and <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> will oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, a conservative Republican. `` You know why they're ready to move up?'' Manges asked his visitor. `` Because they're good people. They're clean and they're fair You do n't catch them running around taking payoffs like that bunch controlled by the establishment.'' They're not doing too badly by Manges, either. As representatives of the state, <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> played pivotal roles in the 1984 settlement of a $ 1.7 billion lawsuit filed by Manges against <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. With the State of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> aligned with <ORGANIZATION> Manges </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> surrendered its oil and gas lease covering 64,000 acres of the <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> The settlement was hailed as a $ 100 million windfall for the state treasury and a $ 400 million victory for Manges. Those figures are now suspect, based as they were on what was later described as a `` property, production and paper deal.'' But there is no doubt that <PERSON> Manges </PERSON> emerged the big winner in his battle with <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was n't trying to get a fix,'' <ORGANIZATION> Manges </ORGANIZATION> insists when questioned about the political funding activities that preceded the state's intervention in his case `` All I wanted was a fair shake.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> did n't want any part of that lawsuit after the election. They knew they were facing people with no love for big oil companies and they knew they could n't buy them.'' There is no evidence to suggest that <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> or <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> peddled their influence on Manges' behalf or in fact did anything improper. On the contrary, both maintain the state will reap millions from the <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> deal for years to come. In an interview at his office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, 110 miles north of Freer, <PERSON> Manges </PERSON> denied claims that he is a deadbeat. `` I always pay when I can, and in the end I pay'em all,'' he said. `` But sometimes you ca n't pay because you do n't have the money. And sometimes you file lawsuits to stall'em until you get the money to pay'em. `` I never deny my debts to anybody.'' At the moment, his most pressing concern is <ORGANIZATION> Seafirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to foreclose on his ranch to settle a debt now exceeding $ 53 million. That debt stems from loans in the early 1980s that Manges used to finance his high-stakes battle with <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> and the related multimillion-dollar political contributions. In a curiously worded ruling against <ORGANIZATION> Manges </ORGANIZATION> this spring, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> H.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> wrote: `` It seems almost unconscionable that the defendants -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Manges </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- incurred a debt of $ 50 million, did not pay and had to be sued. Defendants have no one but themselves to blame for their financial predicament. `` They incurred the debt, and it's time for the fat lady to sing.'' <ORGANIZATION> Seafirst </ORGANIZATION> officials seemed only cautiously optimistic about collecting anytime soon. Bank attorney <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Deely </PERSON> says the ranch has up to a dozen claims against it and the foreclosure can not proceed until those are cleared up and a final court judgment secured. Manges could torpedo the issue with a bankruptcy filing, but seems reluctant to do so. Not that he has any warm feelings toward <LOCATION> Seafirst </LOCATION>. `` They took all my production,'' he complained. `` All my money goes to <ORGANIZATION> Seafirst </ORGANIZATION>. They're supposed to return 25 percent to me for my expenses, but I've never received a cent from them in nearly five years.'' His time might come, though, he says. `` Things will brighten up when we get a Democrat in there as governor,'' he beamed, and he fully expects his good buddy <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> to be the next lieutenant governor. `` They're all there, and they're all in place,'' he said. `` But I do n't want to say anything that might hurt them. I want to help them. Like I said, I do n't want anything from them. I do n't need anything from them.'' Nothing, that is, `` but a fair shake.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ They are a link between the past and the future, bridging a communications gap for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s immigrants, teaching them how to cope in the New World. With some notable exceptions, foreign-language newspapers are thriving in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, partly as the result of a resurgence of ethnic pride.

 When <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Quanwu </PERSON> arrived here two years ago, he learned what was facing him from a series of articles on successful Chinese-Americans in the Chinese-language Centre Daily News. `` It taught me that I've got to be in the studio all day to succeed,'' says the 32-year-old artist, now represented by a major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> gallery. When <PERSON> Enmore </PERSON> <PERSON> Narcisse </PERSON> immigrated from <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> 10 years ago, he had little but a driver's license and spoke little English. The <PERSON> Haiti </PERSON> <PERSON> Observateur </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Creole </ORGANIZATION> newspaper based in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, helped change that. `` Reading the paper, I found this cab company and got me a job,'' <PERSON> Narcisse </PERSON> says, slapping the seat of his taxi. `` It also helped bring me into the Haitian world here.'' After decades of decline, foreign-language newspapers are making a comeback in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In a 1962 survey of the American, foreign-language press, <ORGANIZATION> Yeshiva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON> found 704 publications in 40 languages. Twenty-two years later, he documented 1,031 publications in 58 languages, including about 100 daily newspapers. The papers are teaching new groups of newcomers how to cope with the New World. And, in a break with the past, second - and third-generation immigrants are also turning to the papers as a means of holding onto their cultural heritage `` For first-generation immigrants, the papers play a critical role in the acclimation process,'' <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON> says. `` They provide important social, legal and economic information to new Americans.'' But for second - and third-generation Americans, the papers offer something less tangible `` For them, the papers play more of a cultural and social role,'' <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON> says. `` The papers help the readers define themselves as Americans. After all, we are a nation of immigrants.'' The foreign-language papers are sensitive to this cultural role, and it's helped them stay alive, <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON> says. Many papers now run sections in English or write stories using very simple words in the mother tongue. The heyday of foreign-language newspapers was at the turn of the century at the height of the European immigration, when nearly every town with a substantial immigrant population had a foreign-language press. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> had dozens of Italian and Gaelic papers. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Steinway Street was home to a slew of German-language dailies The Jewish Daily Forward built a towering building on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Lower East Side. Papers in Scandinavian languages could be found in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. But as the older generation died off, leaving a new generation committed to a future in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, not a past in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, foreign-language papers folded. A drop in immigration due to the Depression and legislation restricting entry to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> further hurt the industry. It was not until the 1960s that immigration _ and the foreign-language press _ began to rise again, helped in part by a more liberal quota system for immigrants and economic troubles in other parts of the world. But the accents and the colors of the immigrants had changed. At the turn of the century, 80 percent of the immigrants came from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Starting in the 1960s, the majority came from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and developing countries in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Between 1955 and 1965, for example, the number of Chinese in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> increased eight times to 165,000, replacing the European Jews, Italians and Irish. By the early 1970s, at least eight Chinese-language newspapers were being published. At the same time, a Haitian community was taking root in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, long home to Italians and Jews. Vietnamese refugees were moving to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Newspapers followed both. A growth in ethnic pride and awareness, fueled by the 1960's civil rights movement, also helped spur an increase in the number of papers Americans who had lived here for decades began to look for their roots, seeking a sense of community unavailable from American society-at-large. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s two healthy Greek papers are examples of newspapers that are succeeding despite dwindling immigration from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. But the 110-year-old Il Progresso, the nation's only Italian-language newspaper, announced in early July it was shutting down because of a labor dispute. In addition to the roles they play in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, many ethnic newspapers in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> also try to affect life in the old country, raising money for political movements and pushing for social change. During the 1986 presidential campaign in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, published in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> with a circulation of 77,000, raised $ 3.5 million for candidate <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, according to publisher <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Esclamado </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> Observateur -LRB- circulation 65,000 -RRB- fought the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime for years and continues to agitate for democracy in that <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation. `` I look at my paper as a vehicle for political transformation,'' says the editor, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, a former Wall Street Journal reporter. `` When I was younger I believed in guerrilla warfare. Now it's the power of the press.'' In contrast, <PERSON> Novoye </PERSON> <PERSON> Russkoye </PERSON> <PERSON> Slovo </PERSON> -LRB- circulation 50,000 -RRB-, a Russian-language paper published in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, does n't push politics. It's concerned with teaching <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> immigrants about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We want our readers to be involved in American life,'' says <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Wajnberg </PERSON>, executive vice president of the paper. `` Anyone who thinks they're going back is nuts.'' Helping readers adapt to their new home has always been a priority for the foreign-language press. In years past, the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forward </ORGANIZATION> ran an advice column called <PERSON> Bintel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brev </PERSON>, Yiddish for a packet of letters; readers asked about the intricacies of baseball, intermarriages and social mores. In today's newspapers, articles on immigration law, drugs, AIDS and real estate abound. In a <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> dumpling house, <PERSON> Cindi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mei </PERSON> and three friends pore over the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, catching up on the latest gossip about <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s movie stars. While the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> supports the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> government, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> supports mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the communists. `` It's good to know so that when I go back to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in the summer I'll know what my friends are talking about,'' says the 17-year-old third-generation American. `` It also helps me keep up my Chinese.'' Many immigrants complain that their papers just reprint stories from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> press. `` What you get in the Daily News we get in the Korean papers two days, even three days later,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, a second-generation proprietor of a laundry in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` But reading English is a headache, so I've got no choice.'

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ With hotel prices going through the roof in many places, more and more travelers are looking for bed-and-breakfast accommodations in private homes. It's the fastest-growing segment of the hospitality industry and it's no longer confined to the country. Bed and breakfast hosts are springing up all over the Big Apple. One reason is that it helps New Yorkers pay their own exorbitant housing costs.

 If <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimitri </PERSON>'s bed-and-breakfast guests do n't look out the window, they can they can fantasize that they are staying in a cozy country cottage, complete with a fat cat sitting in front of a white brick fireplace. Actually it's a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> penthouse facing East 86th Street, with a noisy rumble of fume-spewing buses, taxis, trucks and people down below. `` Well, if you want us to replicate the inn in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, you better go there,'' says <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuley </PERSON>, proprietor of <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ventures </ORGANIZATION>, one of seven registries that send visitors to bed-and-breakfast hosts in the Big Apple. Ms. <PERSON> McAuley </PERSON> and others in the B & amp; B industry say the market for their brand of big-city hostelries is booming in the 1980s. They appeal to business people tired of staying in $ 100-a-night hotel rooms where brass statues are riveted to tabletops to prevent theft; to tourists tired of paying $ 13 for a bowl of cereal. B & amp; Bs are an affordable way to explore urban life. Prices range from $ 45 to $ 90 a night for two, depending on the location and other amenities. The arrangement is also helping a lot of New Yorkers pay their soaring housing costs. Overseas visitors have long known the charms of B & amp; Bs, which originated in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The idea spread to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> early in the century, but the cottage industry was nearly wiped out after World War II when rural roadways dotted with B & amp; Bs were replaced by highways and motel chains. Country and seashore B & amp; Bs and unusual urban inns like <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Bishop Mansion survived, but city B & amp; Bs disappeared. Things began to change around 1979 thanks to rising housing and hotel costs. Big city B & amp; Bs are now `` the fastest growing segment of the hospitality industry,'' says <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of Bed and <ORGANIZATION> Breakfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a New Orleans-based trade group. Urban Ventures had 15 hosts in 1979. In 1988, it has 700. The number of people using big-city B & amp; Bs has increased 200 percent to 300 percent each year, Ms. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> says. One reason is their variety. `` They come in condos and apartments and mansions and even in yachts in some locations,'' she says. There are ranches and log cabins in the West, antebellum mansions in the South and French Quarter homes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, guests can find rooms in nearly every <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> neighborhood, from an artsy loft in <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> to a tony Central Park penthouse. There also are a few B & amp; Bs in the outer boroughs of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. There are even country-style places like <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimitri </PERSON>'s penthouse Cheery country red walls welcome visitors into an apartment filled with antiques and lace. A black kettle doorstop and scatter rugs strewn over polished hardwood floors add a country cottage atmosphere. In the living room, a small round table near the window is covered with delicate, spidery lace and adorned with yellowed family photographs. Guests can cozy into an overstuffed claw-footed chair with a cup of <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON>'s own blackberry tea. Some hosts enter the business `` because they like to meet people from other parts of the country and other parts of the world,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. Others do it out of necessity. `` In the cities, it's a help in paying exorbitant rents people are being charged now.'' At Urban Ventures, Ms. <PERSON> McAuley </PERSON> estimates her hosts average $ 10,000 a year _ some more, some less, depending on how often they book guests. Ms. <PERSON> Dimitri </PERSON> is one of Urban Ventures' most popular hostesses. `` I like to get a little fancy-schmancy,'' says the diminutive Ms. <PERSON> Dimitri </PERSON>, a speechwriter. `` I put mints under pillows, give honeymooning couples a split of champagne and always use the good crystal.'' She delighted one couple, in town to start a bicycling honeymoon, by decorating their bikes with crepe-paper ribbons and `` Just Married'' signs. Notes and fresh flowers welcome each guest; bus and subway maps and magazines tell them what's going on around town, and Ms. <PERSON> Dimitri </PERSON> offers tips on the best restaurants and Broadway shows. She caters to the whims of her guests, such as the prince who eats vanilla yogurt for breakfast. Guests pay Ms. <PERSON> Dimitri </PERSON> $ 65 a night for one or $ 80 for two. But they often find other ways to repay her kindnesses, like the 80-year-old French perfumer who sends her a bottle of his special scent each year on her birthday. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Bs may not offer all the amenities of their country cousins. By and large, Ms. <PERSON> McAuley </PERSON> says, breakfasts are `` not going to be the great stuff like <PERSON> Mama </PERSON>'s homemade biscuits.'' `` Besides a few retired hosts, most are not going to be hanging around the house. Our hosts are nurses, they're interns ... they have a place to be at 8-9 in the morning and they're not going to sit around and chat.'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrow </PERSON>, an aspiring writer, bought a five-room penthouse in the theater district and finds that he often has enough guests to pay his monthly mortgage and maintenance expenses. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Collingswood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for several job interviews and stayed at Arrow's digs for five days. `` If you can afford a suite at the Plaza or the Palace, that's wonderful But small inexpensive hotels in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are a drag,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> says. `` Someone told me about this and it seemed like a real nice alternative, and it is.'' Not coincidentally, a new play Arrow is working on is set inside a bed-and-breakfast place. In a big city. In a penthouse, to be exact. `` It's got a lot of amusing possibilities,'' he says.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ When the skiing is done with and <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, settles down to a more placid way, it's an enviable setting for thinkers of cosmic thoughts. That's what a large group of notables, who have much to do with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s designs for living, does for one very cerebral week each year.

 For nearly 40 years, when other people's thoughts turn to vacations and light summer reading, a select contingent of conventioneers has descended on this pastoral Alpine playground to contemplate the state of civilization This year again, some 1,500 creative people who influence the way much of the world buys products, wears clothes, reads books, drives cars, eats, sleeps and works came to ponder and discuss. Their theme was `` The Cutting Edge.'' Or, put another way, where are we as a global society, as the human race? That was the question co-chairmen <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiat </PERSON>, a Los Angeles-based advertising man, and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, a New York-based photographer and graphic designer, bit off and left for the 38th International Design Conference to chew. `` ... it seems that many of us have serious doubts that significant progress has taken place in literature, advertising, architecture, and product and graphic design since the'60s,'' <PERSON> Chiat </PERSON> said in the conference program. `` Is this true? If so, why? If not, why do n't we believe it? Is there a cutting edge? Or is it as dull out there as some of us think?'' The <ORGANIZATION> IDCA </ORGANIZATION> was started in 1951 by the late <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Paepke </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Paepke </PERSON> was a millionaire businessman who, along with his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, who still lives in <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>, set out to make this mostly dilapidated Victorian-era Colorado mining town a mecca for intellectuals and artists. The entertainers and jet set followed. The first conference, `` Design as a Function of Management,'' explored the relationship of design to business. In 1951, TV was a fledgling medium that would change the world. The first commercial color telecast was aired and dacron suits, sugarless chewing gum, orlon and a commercial electronic computer made their debut. In the intervening years, the folks who've designed everything from cars to computers to commercials, the graphic artists, painters, writers, social scientists, museum directors, film-makers _ the men and women who decorate and stimulate our physical and mental lives _ have made the pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION> to learn how design is integrated into politics, art, business, science, education, and philosophy. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Goudvis </PERSON>, a retired mining engineer and <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION> resident who's been attending the conference for eight years, found that the speakers last June had a more `` idealistic slant. Some ominous notes intruded. Dr. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiatt </PERSON>, former dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and currently senior physician at the <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, told the audience that the AIDS toll in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is already catastrophic but we have only seen the beginning.'' He urged more government funding to combat acquired immune deficiency syndrome and a national system of health care. `` I hope the cutting edge, the state of things to be, will be a more humane society,'' he said. A group of museum directors, including <PERSON> Kinshasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Conwill </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Koshalek </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, noted that 80 percent of Americans live in cities and said art has to go to the people. `` We defined space in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that is outlined by four freeways and we consider that our turf,'' said <PERSON> Koshalek </PERSON>, who's held art exhibits in parking lots and now has a revolving collection in a hardware store named The Temporary Contemporary. Ms. <PERSON> Conwill </PERSON> said she believed `` the current <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art scene is lacking in originality and vigor, and black artists are absent from that arena,'' but added that her museum was spotlighting Negro artists in `` probably the most important black community in the world, <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>.''

 The conference was held among the manicured meadows of the <ORGANIZATION> Aspen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanistic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, also founded by the Paepkes. Right away, the snack bar menu revealed it was n't an ordinary convention. Forget greasy burgers and fries, this was <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>, home of the too-thin, the too-rich. Here you have toubouleh sandwiches, yogurt and cucumber soup, and brie with grapes. The participants were overwhelmingly Big City Dwellers From the Coasts. Because most were designers, wardrobes ran the gamut from silks to sleaze, black to brazen, polished to punk. The crowd's differentness became a sameness Set amid wildflowers and fresh air, spectacular sunsets and snowcapped mountains, the gathering had its share of famous names. Former television talk show host <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavett </PERSON> acted as a floating moderator. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON>, producer of 29 films, including `` Chariots of Fire'' and `` The Killing Fields,'' talked about his disagreements with the chiefs at <ORGANIZATION> Coca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> which <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> recently headed, and the state of movies today. `` A movie should start out attempting to be everything _ good, exciting, commercial in the best sense _ and leave an aftertaste,'' <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> said. `` Where we are at now is a lack of ambition in what films can do. The dream in cinema is gone. I think money corrupts the creative process. The sheer cost of making a film today takes away -LRB- creative -RRB- risk.'' <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON>, a Briton who lives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and now produces films for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, said unwillingness to take creative chances pervades American corporate life today. `` There is this extraordinary pressure to perform, to out-perform last year, to out-perform this year,'' said <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON>, a fan of smaller-budget movies with unknown actors and directors. `` The reason we are chasing the Japanese is that the Japanese have this extraordinary ability to make a decision and then take a long view.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberger </PERSON>, architecture critic of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> since 1973, said that in the past few years `` there has been a tendency to believe that the most profound effect of architecture has been deciding what kind of molding to put on the $ 3 million beach house of an investment banker.'' `` Architects have become so obsessed with size, corporate power and the lushness of detail that the idea that architecture serves a social purpose has been forgotten,'' <PERSON> Goldberger </PERSON> said. Feminist <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> and author of `` The Feminine Mystique'' and `` The Second Stage'' and now at work on `` The Fountain of Age,'' said a new feminine mystique is telling <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women to give up the social, economic and legal gains of the past two decades and `` put on the girdle again, put on the miniskirt'' and go home again. `` The answer is ` repent of your ways, of your feminist dreams, of your ideas and your aspirations ...,''' <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON> said facetiously, nearly drowned out by laughter and applause. `` This economy would really collapse if the women went home again, to say nothing of the family's economy.'' <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON> thought the nation was coming to the end of an era of devotion to greed and gave it a verbal shove: `` The nation's resources are great enough to accept public responsibility. ... If we let go unchallenged this culture of greed, of privatism, not only are the poor, the homeless, the underclass going to create -LRB- a possible -RRB- depression, the middle class, the professional class and our children, earning more than we did when we were their age, are going to have a mean life.'' So what is The Cutting Edge, and where is it? `` The cutting edge is not always where we assume it to be,'' said <ORGANIZATION> IDCA </ORGANIZATION> co-chairman <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. `` It crops up in unpredictable places and the prognosticators have a very hard time finding it.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Judds </ORGANIZATION>, the mother-daughter team that bounded out of nowhere to country music stardom less than five years ago, will get their rags-to-riches story told in a fall special on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. `` People will have a chance to see us on the road and see what it's like to go through what we're going through, the pressures of being so close professionally and personally,'' says <PERSON> Wynonna </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, 24. `` We filmed all day long yesterday in <LOCATION> Colesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Mama </PERSON>'s brother, who's a Baptist preacher, has a small church.'' As the Judds toured on the country music circuit this summer, TV cameras also followed them to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, who is 18 years older than her daughter but looks more like her sister, says, `` The image we have right now is that we're almost joined at the lips. We share a common bond in music. We're alike in a lot of ways, but we're very different. The director thinks that's interesting enough to investigate in-depth.'' The Judds popped into country music prominence in 1984. While <PERSON> Wynonna </PERSON> was in high school they had shunned honky-tonks and practiced at home, working on <PERSON> Wynonna </PERSON>'s singing and acoustic guitar playing and <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON>'s harmonizing, and the family image they wanted to project. `` We got signed at a live audition,'' <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> says. `` We did n't have biographies or photographs, had never had a band or played in public. A deal was made with Curb Records and RCA. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> has produced all their albums, using arranger <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, top country songwriters and sticking to the presentation the <ORGANIZATION> Judds </ORGANIZATION> already had worked out. `` When our first single -LRB- `` Had a Dream'' -RRB- was on the radio, I was working full time as a nurse and <PERSON> Wynonna </PERSON> was a temporary secretary,'' <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> says. After the second single, `` Mama He's Crazy,'' reached No. 1 on the country charts, the <ORGANIZATION> Judds </ORGANIZATION> still had flea-market furniture and unmatched dishes. When the <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> presented awards in October 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Judds </ORGANIZATION> won the Horizon Award, essentially meaning `` best new act.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CMA </ORGANIZATION> named them vocal group of the year and they also won Grammy Awards for best country performance by a duo or group, the following three years. `` Mom and I have n't always had it this wonderful,'' <PERSON> Wynonna </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> still turns off lights when she leaves a room and clips grocery coupons. `` All my life I felt I was a face in the crowd, not having any money,'' she says. <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> has another daughter, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, who has finished her sophomore year at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION>, studying French, history and art history. She is not a singer, but <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> says, `` In the summer we like to take her out and slam her around on the road a little bit. I do n't want her to think that it's easy. Last year I paid her $ 10 a day to be bus engineer. It meant cleaning the bus.'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> declined the position this year. <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> took back her maiden name, <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, after she was divorced in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and returned with her daughters to her native <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. `` We'd been in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> seven years,'' <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> says. `` They were thinking <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> was home and normal. We went to <PERSON> Morrill </PERSON>, Ky. It had maybe 200 people. `` We lived on a hilltop, did n't have a telephone or TV. I wanted them to develop their imaginations and play together. They worked in the garden, learned about animals.'' <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> entered nursing school; <PERSON> Wynonna </PERSON> began singing. `` Mom had a guitar someone had given her,'' she says. `` I had a friend who would teach me. Someone gave me a book. I guess I'm lucky to have an ear for learning I would listen to the radio and try to get all I could, teaching myself. `` We would buy discount records. We did n't have the money for full-price albums. It caused us to discover all these weird but wonderful types of music. My first influence was Bluegrass.'' Only <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> lives with her mother now. <PERSON> Wynonna </PERSON> bought a small farm in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, `` close enough to call Mom to say I'm coming over. `` A lot of times Mom and I could n't get along but we could still sing together,'' <PERSON> Wynonna </PERSON> says. `` You have someone to share the joys, awards, excitement and incredible opportunities with. Other times, being so close, we know how to bug each other.'' <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> says of her daughter, `` She makes me the maddest of anybody and makes me laugh the loudest.''

 At age 85, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> is still drawing in the dark, capturing in his unique caricatures the essence and spirit of <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. For six decades, the genial, white-bearded artist has sat in the theater and sketched, making graceful line drawings that seem to come alive on the page. ` I've learned to annoy as few people as possible,'' he was saying the other day, reflecting on all the hard work he has done during performances with a small sketch pad and a Venus HB pencil. <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> was sitting in a barber chair in his studio on the top floor of an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> brownstone where he has lived for more than 40 years with his wife, <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON>. It's where he finishes all his drawings. Today, <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> draws more than theater folk. Movie stars, television personalities, politicians, even ordinary citizens are his subjects, but it's the theater drawings, particularly his sketches that appear regularly in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, that most people remember. On a slanted and well-worn drawing table perched in front of the barber chair, <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> opens a large sketch book. It's filled with what look like random doodles _ a cigar, wicker furniture, the detail of window, a bow tie. They're bits and pieces of remembrances from the recent Broadway production of `` Long Day's Journey into Night. `` These are very helpful in putting together a sketch,'' he says. `` You ca n't trust a faulty memory.'' These sketches were interspersed with roughly drawn portraits of the play's two stars, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON>. `` She has a way of putting her hand to her face all the time,'' he says. <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> says he does no research before beginning to sketch a new show. `` The characters are what interests me, but as for the play itself, sometimes I come out and I do n't know what it was all about,'' he says. `` When I'm working, I concentrate on the actual design or the image rather than the thought. Later I go to the opening and can see the play.'' <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> has always been partial to drawing the larger-than-life actors, particularly comedians. `` Most of them have invented themselves,'' he says. `` They know what they look like. People like <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON>, Zero Mostel and, in the earlier days, the <ORGANIZATION> Marx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> or Mae West. They were all real inventions. The modern actor is a little more the fellow next door. The people in the street are more theatrical than most actors today.'' The artist used to go out of town, to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, to see new shows and do his sketches. Today, with the Broadway tryout a rare occurrence, he goes to rehearsals or run-throughs to do his sketching or even draws from photographs or videocassettes supplied by producers. `` It's the little things that help develop the character in a drawing,'' <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> explains. `` Some simple little thing, like the way a fellow holds his hand or his cigarette. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, for instance, the way he holds a cigar is very unique. He holds it differently than <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON> does.'' <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, started out as a sculptor and later turned to painting. `` Then suddenly I developed this insane passion for line, and what you can do with it, and how it can communicate,'' he recalls. `` It's always mysterious to me how it happens.'' His first drawing in The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> appeared in 1925, a sketch of Sir <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, a famous comedian of the day, making one of many `` farewell'' tours in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. From then on, <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> was hooked on the theater and the actors on stage. `` I'm more interested in people than in nature,'' he says. `` It would never occur to me to sit on the lip of the Grand Canyon and paint it. I'm interested in people, the way they dress and eat and walk and dance and talk. Whatever they do.'' <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON>'s drawings have also intrigued people because he puts `` <PERSON> Nina </PERSON>,'' the name of his daughter, in all his sketches. He got the idea the day she was born in 1945. `` I just wanted to record it historically that she was here,'' he says. `` I kept it up for two or three weeks and then tried to stop it. I would leave <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> out but the mail was unbelievable.'' Today, `` Nina'' is always the last thing to go into one of his drawings and he puts a little number next to his name if there are two or more Ninas in a picture. <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> will even make an appearance on a postage stamp. <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> has designed three 25-cent stamps _ portraits of <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickford </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Rosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ponselle </ORGANIZATION> _ that the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will release over the next year. It took a special decision by Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to allow the stamps to have <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> imprinted on them. <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> calls his job `` a lemming profession,'' one which apparently has no future, and says there are very few outlets for his kind of work. `` I'm always surprised that I get paid for all of this,'' <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> says. `` I would do it anyway. Maybe not in the theater but I certainly would be sitting around a cafe and be doodling away. `` My demands on life are very small. I like what I'm doing. I do n't have any hobbies. I'm here all day long seven days a week and in the evening we go to the theater or have people in and sit around and talk. I find that very engaging. I could never retire. I would n't know what to do with my time.''

 On an April day in 1908, the steamship <PERSON> Kasato </PERSON> <PERSON> Maru </PERSON> set sail from <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with 781 Japanese peasants contracted to work on the coffee plantations of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Their plan was to come home in two to five years and start new lives with their earnings. But most stayed in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> to become the founders of what today is the world's largest Japanese community outside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ 1,168,000 strong. They are Brazilians first, they tell you, but as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has risen in economic power and influence across the world, they are feeling the pull of the land of their ancestors: _ <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Hori </PERSON>, 20, wearing faded blue jeans and a white sweat shirt, kneels silently on a straw mat, his eyes riveted on the kimono-clad instructor who patiently goes through the precise movements of the `` chado,'' centuries-old Japanese tea ceremony _ A few blocks away in downtown <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hifumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Konno </PERSON>, 55, in a blue and white cotton kimono, rehearses the delicate and intricate steps of the `` <PERSON> Kyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujima </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryo </PERSON>,'' one of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s traditional classical dance forms The renewed interest in homeland traditions is a relatively recent phenomenon among <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s Japanese, according to <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Masahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanada </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Brazil-Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. `` For many years, especially after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defeat in World War II, the main concern in the community was to integrate, to be as Brazilian as possible. This led to an almost total rejection of anything identified with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he said in an interview. `` But in the 1970s, as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> prospered, many in the community started feeling a strong sense of curiosity and a need to understand and recover a cultural past which for years had been ignored.'' He added that over the past 10 years the number of people learning Japanese at the Cultural Alliance `` has been increasing by 15 percent annually.'' The alliance houses <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s largest Japanese-language school, with more than 2,000 students. Similar increases have been registered in courses of traditional Japanese art forms such as flower arrangements, origami -LRB- paper folding -RRB- and caligraphy, he said. <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Hori </PERSON> explained why he decided to learn the tea ceremony and take Japanese language classes. `` I always felt that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s recovery after the war and its current economic strength could best be understood by studying its culture, something I knew nothing about,'' he said. <PERSON> Kaesundri </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakisaka </PERSON>, one the directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese-Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said another important reason for the community's renewed interest in its cultural background is `` a kind of instinctive concern that one day these traditions may disappear. During a break in her dance rehearsals, Mrs. <PERSON> Konno </PERSON> said, `` If we do n't learn and transmit our cultural heritage to the younger generations, it will all fade away.'' She said that despite her efforts, her two daughters have shown little interest `` in following my example. They have become too Brazilian.'' <PERSON> Wakisaka </PERSON> said the Japanese community's assimilation into Brazilian culture and society was `` progressing so smoothly and steadily that in 50 years it will be almost impossible to distinguish it as an ethnically different group.'' He said the main reason was growing number of interracial marriages. <PERSON> Wakisaka </PERSON> estimated there were about 115,00 marriages in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> between the descendants of Japanese and non-Japanese. Most Japanese-Brazilians interviewed insisted that their life styles and way of thinking are Brazilian, but they make clear their heritage is not far behind. <PERSON> Kenichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamai </PERSON>, a 58-year-old attorney said, `` I am so Brazilian that I only remember my Japanese background when I look at myself in the mirror.'' But, sitting on a beige sofa in his three bedroom apartment, he said he never misses a chapter of `` Takeda Shigen'' -LRB- The Great Samurai -RRB-, a soap opera produced in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and aired every Sunday in Japanese by a local TV station. He also starts his day reading <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, one of three Japanese-language newspapers published in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>. With his wife <PERSON> Emi </PERSON> sitting at his side, <PERSON> Yamai </PERSON> also said he insisted that his daughter <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>, a 28-year-old dentist, `` marry a Japanese because mixed marriages never work out. And when my two sons are ready to marry, I will make the same demand.'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayashi </PERSON>, a 43-year-old economist, said, `` No matter how Brazilian we feel or act or are seen by others, there is no denying our heritage. It's in our blood and will never go away.'' For <PERSON> Harumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawasaki </PERSON>, a 50-year-old teacher in a Japanese language school, `` being Japanese in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is like having a split personality, for we are constantly straddling two entirely different cultures.''

 Silicone, plaster and glue can go a long way toward helping to heal wounded self-images. `` I think it's amazing,'' says <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s Medical Sculpture Unit. `` A lot of people, when they first come, are hesitant about wearing anything artificial or rubber. They think it will fall off, or people will laugh. `` After they see the results, it's incredible.'' Hundreds of people each year who have lost an eye, ear, nose, finger, toe, breast or other feature to birth defects, cancer, accidents and fire _ and who ca n't be helped by plastic surgery _ seek assistance from prosthetic artists. `` I really do n't know what to say for making me feel like a whole person again,'' a 69-year-old <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> woman, whose face was disfigured and right eye lost to cancer, wrote to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. `` People just ca n't believe how anyone can do such a wonderful job. I can go anyplace and people do n't stare. `` It's a wonderful feeling to have in my life again.'' <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stasilowicz </PERSON>, 63, of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, lost his right ear to cancer two decades ago. `` I said to some of my cronies that I got a new ear, and they said which one? It was very exhilarating.'' Prosthetics can be especially important for children, says <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who is seeking a corporate sponsor for a center for disfigured children here. `` If not treated properly and quickly, they can have psychological problems. Children can be pretty cruel and -LRB- disfigured -RRB- children get teased.'' Popular shows and movies have helped alleviate that problem. In the `` Six Million Dollar Man,'' and `` Bionic Woman'' series, people with mechanical parts have superhuman strength, and the recent movie `` Robo Cop'' dealt with replacing lost features and organs with mechanical ones. `` If they're the bionic kid,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> says, `` they're the hit of the class.'' Of about 200 patients treated here annually <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> estimates the breakdown is 50 ears, 30 breasts, 20 noses, 20 eyes and 50 `` miscellaneous.'' Most health insurance covers the cost, which runs about $ 1,400 for an ear or nose and $ 2,000 for an eye. There are about 200 prosthetic sculptors working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, most of them affiliated with <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> clinic in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and a medical center associated with <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who also directs a 22-year-old graduate program to train the artists. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> also offer such courses. `` It's harder to get into than medical school. It's a very strange combination to have people interested in science and art _ that's why the program is so small,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> says. The course of study includes anatomy, pathology, anatomical sketching, medical and scientific drawing, and medical graphics. Graduates generally can set up their own business, freelance, or work for a hospital or medical center. One works for `` Star Wars'' creator <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' Industrial Light and Magic making creatures for science fiction films. Sculptors take a plaster mold of the patient's undamaged feature, then make a silicone rubber copy and carefully match skin tone. The replacement is applied daily with a medical adhesive. Though the appearance of prostheses are strikingly realistic, many of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s patients are apprehensive about how well they will work. `` People ask if it will fall off in their soup.'' One of the center's success stories is a 3-year-old <LOCATION> Lakeworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, girl who lost half her right foot in a lawnmower accident. Within six months of getting her prosthesis, she was taking ballet lessons. `` Her mother says she wo n't take her silicone rubber toes off,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> says.

<HEAD>In Complex Medical Cases, Ethics Comes To Forefront</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARK RIDGE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Questions surrounding withholding and cost of treatment, and even confidentiality, have hospitals turning more frequently to special consultants and committees to help search for the answers. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimates that at least 60 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals with 200 or more beds have such committees, made up of doctors, philosophers, theologians and social workers. A report in last week's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said 30 percent of 280 patients in a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> study presented ethical problems. Some hospitals, like <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, have doctors like <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Puma </PERSON> as consultants. La <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> does at least two consultations a week. An ethics consultant helps clarify issues and `` provides a lot of comfort for myself as a primary care physician,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, director of research and family practice at Lutheran General. In addition to medicine's capacity to prolong life, `` in a society where lawsuits are common, lawsuits are less likely when an ethics committee has been consulted,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bioethics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` It's harder to demonstrate that a doctor has acted unprofessionally.'' The fact that not all ethics consultants are doctors raises other issues. Among them, said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, are `` Who should be entitled to do this and what qualifications and training should they have? What are the proper duties to give to someone who is an ethics consultant _ teaching, troubleshooting, or policy-making? What is the job?'' Another unresolved issue is consultants' legal responsibility, said <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>. `` I think, down the road, the courts are going to have to clarify their role.'' Medical guidelines will ease debate over withholding treatment, said <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION>. `` The big ethical issue of the 1990s is going to be medical indigents, and what kind of care we provide for patients who can not provide for themselves.''

 Some professional birdwatchers look down on amateurs, but the legacy of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first ornithology professor unites their work. <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ornithology </ORGANIZATION>, which owes its creation to <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, contains millions of pages of behavior studies and photographs and the world's largest collection of birdsongs _ more than 5,000 species. Equally important, it links ornithologists and amateur birdwatchers. `` The game is to position the laboratory between the professional community and the birding community, the amateur and the professional,'' said executive director <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Walcott </PERSON>. `` We are an information broker between the two.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, an expert on red-winged blackbirds and pioneer in recording and filming wild birds, headed <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s only doctoral program in ornithology from the 1920s to the'40s. <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, a business graduate and student of <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s, financed much of the lab and 180-acre sanctuary near <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>. The laboratory generates money through dues and project fees, sale of publications and bird recordings, and home-study courses in ornithology and bird photography. Its 1-year-old Project FeederWatch last year paid 4,000 birdwatchers to fill out a computerized form twice weekly recording the species that appear at their backyard feeders. The goal this year is 10,000. `` We can only begin to guess at what we might have been able to accomplish if we had had this kind of information years ago,'' <PERSON> Walcott </PERSON> said, `` how many extinct species we could have saved.''

<HEAD>New Solar Cell Stack Yields Greater Conversion Efficiency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new combination of solar cells cracked a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s efficiency goal, and could find use in the space program or eventual Earth-bound solar power plants, officials say. Researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> stacked a gallium arsenide solar cell made by <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on a silicon cell from <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to achieve a 31 percent efficiency rating. It can generate 31 watts of electricity for every 100 watts of sunlight it collects. <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> had set a 30 percent efficiency goal, and previous attempts at stacking yielded 20 percent, said <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Arvizu </PERSON>. The gallium arsenide cell is best at converting light on the blue segment of the spectrum, while the silicon chip is better on red. Each cell is about 27 percent efficient. Researchers may almost have reached the limit of efficiency for single solar cells, so stacking is the most promising way to achieve high efficiency, said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Werthen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Varian </PERSON>'s manager of solar research. `` The bottom line is how much is the electricity on a cents-per-kilowatt-hour basis,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Annan </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s photovoltaic energy technology division Some coal - and oil-fired power systems cost 30 cents per kwh, and <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION>'s new chip might generate at 12 cents within a decade, <PERSON> Annan </PERSON> said Similar costs might also be possible with a cell developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Solar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solar </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Annan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> SERI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> reduced the cost of production, while <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> increased efficiency, he said.

<HEAD>Softer Food May Be Shrinking, Weakening Teeth</HEAD>

 Teeth are getting smaller, but do n't go measuring your children _ or even your great-grandchildren.

Teeth have shrunk about 50 percent in 100,000 years, and twice as fast in the last 10,000 years, says <PERSON> Brace </PERSON>, who has studied teeth for 25 years. `` The advent of earth ovens, pottery and other utensils has played a direct role,'' he says. Ancient cemeteries contain many bodies with no teeth where earthen ovens were common; in areas with ovens, there are more teeth. `` As softer cooked foods became available, our ancestors had less need of big strong teeth to survive,'' he says.

<HEAD>Researchers Hope to Use Lightning to Predict Storms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The National Hurricane Center is counting lightning strokes to see if they could lead to better thunderstorm warnings, but one meteorologist says such warnings could be too late to do any good. A correlation between the the severity of a storm and the number, frequency and intensity of lightning before it would let forecasters issue more timely and accurate warnings, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Pifer </PERSON>, a meteorologist at the center. The equipment for comparison has been available for years, but <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has been slow to use the information for weather prediction, he said. `` Specialized users like electric companies, forestry services or power generation plants are more concerned with lightning than the general public.'' `` In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, we have fairly short-lived storms.

 A 2-year-old girl lies in a hospital room suffering from a rare, incurable blood disorder that involves painful treatment. In another room, relatives of a 56-year-old comatose woman recall her wish not to be kept alive with no hope of recovery. Two patients. Two medical histories. But each poses ethics questions, which have <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals turning more frequently to special consultants and committees to help search for the answers. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimates that at least 60 percent of the nation's hospitals with 200 or more beds have such committees. A few, such as Lutheran General Hospital in this north <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, have doctors like <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Puma </PERSON>, who serve as ethics consultants. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Puma </PERSON>, the first graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pritzker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> with a fellowship in ethics, is both a doctor and a teacher, trying to balance the complexity of medical technology with patient care `` Clinical medicine has within it a great deal of humanity that has been de-emphasized with the development of technology. It's simply time for us to look back at our values of caring and balance them with those of curing,'' he said In last week's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an issue that focused on medical ethics, Dr. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> reported on a study of 212 women and 68 men who visited a doctor's office run by the school in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION> from November 1983 to July 1984. Eighty-four patients, or 30 percent, presented ethical problems ranging from refusing treatment to confidentiality and the cost of care. La Puma, a hospital staff member, does at least two consultations a week, mostly triggered by doctors, nurses, lawyers or hospital administrators. One involved <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jendrzejyk </PERSON>, a 2-year-old suffering from a rare, fatal blood disorder who had been hospitalized 18 times since birth. Doctors wanted to use painful kidney dialysis and a machine to help <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> breathe, but her parents questioned the benefits. `` I felt that each treatment should be evaluated for how much burden it caused the baby and the parents. These parents take their job as parents very seriously,'' said <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Puma </PERSON>, who recommended against the machines. He suggested a long-term care plan that would include simpler treatment involving the use of fluids, with the goal of relieving <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON>'s pain. So far, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> has n't needed the dialysis or mechanical ventilator. She has gone home and is doing fine, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> said. `` He definitely opened our eyes to all the options,'' said her mother, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jendrzejyk </PERSON>. `` He was very thorough with us, real understanding and supportive.'' In another case, a comatose 56-year-old woman's cirrhosis of the liver was complicated by stomach bleeding that required her to receive three pints of blood a day. La <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> declined to identify the woman. Relatives and doctors discussed discontinuing treatment. She once said she did n't want to live without hope of recovery and because it was thought she might die her her daily transfusions, in effect, were a waste of blood. Although there was little medical research available on her prognosis, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Puma </PERSON> said, `` I thought we should give her the benefit of the doubt.'' Treatment continued and the woman revived enough to leave her bed. When the bleeding resumed, she was able to tell doctors in writing that she wanted to continue treatment to spend time with her family. She died a few days later. `` You have to let patients tell you what the issues are,'' La <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Out of the details of their own medical situation and their own values come the ethical issues that are important to them. Putting that all together, medically and ethically, makes a whole.'' An ethics consultant helps clarify issues and also `` provides a lot of comfort for myself as a primary care physician,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, director of research and family practice at Lutheran General. In addition to medicine's capacity to prolong life, `` in a society where lawsuits are common, lawsuits are less likely when an ethics committee has been consulted,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bioethics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` It's harder to demonstrate that a doctor has acted unprofessionally. It's the basic idea that two heads are better than one in a terminal situation.'' Consultants' recommendations are n't binding, said Dr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, an assistant professor of medicine and ethics consultant at two teaching hospitals associated with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. However, in almost all the cases he consulted on during 1 -LCB- years in 1984 and 1985, doctors said it `` increased their confidence in caring for the patient.'' La <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> evaluated a formal ethics consultation service established in 1986 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> and Clinics. He reported in <ORGANIZATION> JAMA </ORGANIZATION>'s issue on ethics that 45 doctors requested consultations for 51 patients and that in 36 cases, they found the consultation `` very important'' in patient care. In 96 percent of the cases, doctors indicated they planned to request an ethics consultation in the future. Years ago, <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said, the family doctor often discussed ethical issues in patient care. But technology has changed all that, and he believes the need for ethics consultants, especially those trained in medicine, will grow. Not all ethics consultants are doctors. Many ethics committee members are philosophers, theologians and social workers. That raises other issues. Among them, according to <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>: `` Who should be entitled to do this and what qualifications and training should they have? What are the proper duties to give to someone who is an ethics consultant _ teaching, troubleshooting, or policy-making? What is the job?'' Most of La <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION>'s training is clinical, but he studied social science, health policy, and medical arts history and took informal courses in law and ethics. He also asks lawyers, philosophers and others for advice. `` The field is so new. We actually should be talking about what makes up a good ethics consultation. The battle over who should do it is a turf battle.'' Another unresolved issue is consultants' legal responsibility, said <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>. `` I think, down the road, the courts are going to have to clarify their role.'' Many ethical debates now center around ending or withholding treatment, but <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> believes as doctors develop guidelines that may be easier to resolve. `` I think the big ethical issue of the 1990s is going to be medical indigents,'' he said, `` and what kind of care we provide for patients who can not provide for themselves.''

 Some professional birdwatchers look down on amateurs, but the legacy of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first ornithology professor unites their work. <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ornithology </ORGANIZATION>, which owes its creation to <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, contains millions of pages of behavior studies and photographs and the world's largest collection of birdsongs _ more than 5,000 species. Equally important, it links ornithologists and amateur birdwatchers. `` The game is to position the laboratory between the professional community and the birding community, the amateur and the professional,'' said executive director <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Walcott </PERSON>. `` We are an information broker between the two.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> is synonomous with ornithology in the minds of birdwatchers,'' said <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, co-publisher of Birdwatchers Digest. `` They are greatly respected as a technical and research facility. `` But <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> has also managed to serve as a popular outreach, helping bridge the gap between professional and amateur.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, an expert on red-winged blackbirds and pioneer in recording and filming wild birds, headed <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s only doctoral program in ornithology from the 1920s to the'40s. He fashioned a first-rate program at <LOCATION> Cornell </LOCATION>. But it was <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, a business graduate, who helped make the lab in <LOCATION> Sapsucker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Woods </LOCATION>, a 180-acre sanctuary outside <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, a reality. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, who won a `` Life'' magazine contest with the bird photography <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> taught him, financed much of the construction. The main building holds the largest collection of works by bird artist <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Agassiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuertes </PERSON>. A floor-to-ceiling window overlooks a 10-acre pond, so visitors can watch feeder birds and waterfowl and listen to sounds piped in by microphones installed outside. During <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s lifetime _ he died in 1964 _ the laboratory gained international recognition, but his continued connections with amateurs and volunteer conservationists were frowned upon by the new breed of professional ornithologists. In response, the university made the lab a separate department, but without professors or course offerings and with no students of its own. It was expected to support itself financially, and generates money through dues and project fees, sale of publications and bird recordings, and home-study courses in ornithology and bird photography. Membership dropped so low by 1980 that <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> seriously considered shutting down the lab. <PERSON> Walcott </PERSON>, who earned a reputation as an educational promoter developing public television science shows like `` Nova'' and `` 3-2-1 Contact,'' has boosted its membership from 2,000 to 13,000 in eight years and rejuventated its home-study enrollment to about 9,000. `` Now that we have become stable again we are turning our attention to our research efforts and producing a tremendous scientific archive,'' he said. `` Of course, all we do here has really one focus _ conservation. The information we collect is highly useful as an environmental monitoring tool and we hope will serve as a biological early warning system.'' Its foremost study is in bioacoustics, or bird communication. `` With the help of computers we are making progress in finding out what birds say to each other, and they do communicate,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, head of the program. The research has led to similar efforts involving whales and elephants. The lab's 1-year-old Project FeederWatch last year paid 4,000 backyard birdwatchers to fill out a computerized form twice weekly recording the species that appear at their feeders. The goal this year is 10,000, and <PERSON> Walcott </PERSON> notes there are more than 82 million Americans who put out food for wild birds. `` We can only begin to guess at what we might have been able to accomplish if we had had this kind of information years ago,'' he said, `` how many extinct species we could have saved.''

<HEAD>For American Business Overseas, Rule No. 1 is Mind Your Manners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has long advised prospective exporters to do their homework, mind their manners and refrain from breaking cultural taboos if they want to sell American products overseas. A private trade expert has given <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> a hand in advising would-be exporters on how to behave _ such as not putting your drink on the desk of a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> executive while chatting about business. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said the British manager `` probably will refrain from calling the bobbies'' if you put a coffee or tea mug on his desk. But, after all, it just is n't done. <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> talks about doing business overseas in a forthcoming issue of <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, which is published by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Leading off, he recalls an old story about the cultural differences among Americans, Germans, French and Russians. `` In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, everything is permitted that is not forbidden,'' <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> said. `` In <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, everything is forbidden that is not permitted. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, everything is permitted, even if it is forbidden. And in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, everything is forbidden, even if it is permitted.'' <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> noted, however, that in these days of `` glasnost,'' or openness, the Soviet description probably should be updated to `` almost everything is forbidden, even if it is permitted.'' The serious side is that when people do business internationally they should learn not only about the legal, financial and technical dimensions of dealing in the marketplace, but also about the people with whom they are dealing. `` You do n't have to go native, or lose your character, to be a successful entrepreneur overseas,'' <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> said. `` In fact, you should n't. But you do need to have the capacity to understand your customers' needs, your international partners' concerns and your competitors' strengths.'' An important first step is `` to be accepted'' by foreign buyers, he said. In most countries, doing business `` involves a higher level of trust'' than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> added. That is probably because Americans put their trust in the legal contract and in the courts. `` Perhaps that's why there are more lawyers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> than there are in all of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` That's also why developing personal relationships with potential customers is so important.'' Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food and agricultural products sell well in different foreign cultures without being changed. However, there are some that require modification. `` Coca-Cola has been successful in almost every country of the world, and so have <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>'s Corn Flakes,'' <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> said. `` But General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> had a hard time introducing cake mixes to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>'s also was unable to launch their canned soups in European markets until they were reformulated to meet European tastes.'' Some advertising agencies may say a product's message can be taken worldwide without changing it. `` Well, almost,'' <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> said. `` You might have to change the language _ and perhaps the medium from TV to billboards or to newspapers.'' In many cases, a nation's culture determines what are perceived as desirable qualities of a product. `` For example, a study was made of what people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> saw as desirable attributes of toothpaste,'' he said. `` The results showed that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers preferred a refreshing taste, the French wanted one that would kill germs, the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> wanted it to appeal to children, and the Brazilians cared about its color and whether or not the tube squeezed easily.'' In another instance, the successful introduction of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Dutch-type of cookie into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> followed market research showing that Japanese consumers preferred a more glazed finish, a smaller cookie with different spices, and more elegant packaging. `` The business person who launched this product in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> did his homework, and his cookie is selling,'' <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> said. Different economic climates also can have an impact on a product's pricing strategy. `` For example, if you are selling a product in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> or another country with a rapid rate of inflation, be prepared to change your prices monthly, sometimes weekly,'' <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>65 Percent of American Households Now Have VCRs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Video cassette recorders, compact disc players, camcorders and other consumer electronics products are becoming standard fare in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> home, according to a Gallup survey. These products are no longer just symbols of an affluent singles lifestyle but are finding their way into the homes of families with children, says the <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which commissioned the study. `` People always think of these as yuppie products, and they're not,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Saraniti </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the electronics group The VCR is the fastest growing product in the $ 41-billion-a-year consumer electronics industry, she said. The number of households with a VCR has been climbing at 10 percent to 12 percent a year and sales are expected to top 13 million this year, she said. The survey of 1,008 adults found that 65 percent of the households polled had a VCR. By household composition, VCR ownership was 40 percent among single adults, 63 percent among households of two or more adults, and 78 percent among couples with children. The survey was conducted by telephone last spring by the Gallup Organization. The results have a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The next most popular product was a pair of speakers for audio playback, an item claimed by 40 percent of the households overall. Some 26 percent said they had an electronic typewriter, 24 percent said they had a telephone answering machine, 18 percent had a personal computer, 14 percent had a compact disc player and 8 percent had a camcorder, according to the survey. In all of the product categories, the ownership percentages for couples with children were higher than for single adults: 47 percent compared with 25 percent for audio speakers; 32 percent compared with 14 percent for electronic typewriters, 24 percent compared with 18 percent for telephone answering machines, 24 percent compared with 8 percent for personal computers, 15 percent compared with 10 percent for compact disc players, and 13 percent compared with 3 percent for camcorders. Though the prices of most consumer electronics products have dropped since they were first introduced, income is still a determining factor in purchases _ the higher a household's income, the more likely it is to have one of these products. In households with income over $ 60,000 a year, 88 percent said they had a VCR, compared with 49 percent of households earning under $ 20,000, the survey found. The disparity was more apparent with personal computers, which were in 46 percent of the higher-income households compared with 10 percent of the lower-income homes, and camcorders, 25 percent compared with 3 percent. Portable stereo units known as `` boom boxes'' were the most popular audio equipment, owned by 48 percent of those surveyed. Smaller radio-tape players with headphones were owned by 40 percent. Nearly every household _ 99 percent _ had a television set, according to the survey, and predictably the more people in the household, the more TV sets there are likely to be. About half of the single adults said they had one set, about a third had two sets and 14 percent reported three or more. In households with children, 43 percent had three or more TV sets, 31 percent had two and 26 percent had just one.

<HEAD>Report Cites Labor Shortage in Washington Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area has a labor shortage but it can be reduced by creation of support systems giving people more incentive and opportunity to work, according to a study released Monday. The report from the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> cites strong growth in the area's private sector, in part fueled by federal contracting, as the reason for the region's booming economy and consequently low unemployment. Recent figures have put area unemployment at 2.7 percent, described by economists as a `` frictional'' rate because most unemployed workers are in the processs of switching jobs rather than looking for them. In addition to private sector growth, the area's growing importance in high-tech, international and regional development is a strong impetus to local economic development, according to author <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Grier </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is becoming the hub of an emerging mega-metropolis that has become identified as the ` <ORGANIZATION> Chesapeake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION>,''' which combines the economic power of the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> and Norfolk-Newport News areas, <PERSON> Grier </PERSON> said. But it also faces problems recruiting workers, <PERSON> Grier </PERSON> says, as housing costs increase and commuting distances lengthen, <PERSON> Grier </PERSON> says. `` Many people who might otherwise consider locating in the greater <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area find themselves priced out of the market,'' he says. Making better use of resident resources could add up to 300,000 people to the current labor force, <PERSON> Grier </PERSON> says. Support systems to compensate for special needs, such as flexible and part-time schedules, could attract retired people who otherwise might not want to work, according to the report. In addition, providing child care facilities would allow mothers on welfare and other non-working mothers more freedom to work, the study says.

 <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, the Anglo-Dutch household products group, said Monday its second-quarter net profit jumped 11 percent, with most lines of business contributing to the improvement. <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, whose brands include Lever, <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Chesebrough-Pond </PERSON>'s, said net profit in the three months ended June 30 rose to $ 371 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $ 367 million, or 19.8 cents a share in the same period a year earlier.

 <PERSON> Enzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrari </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s greatest sports car builder and racing pioneer, died at his home in <LOCATION> Modena </LOCATION>, his auto company announced today. He was 90. In a statement, the company said, `` <PERSON> Enzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrari </PERSON> serenely ended his earthly life Sunday, Aug. 14.'' No cause of death was given, but <PERSON> Ferrari </PERSON> was known to suffer from a kidney disease. At <ORGANIZATION> Ferrari </ORGANIZATION>'s side when he died were his son <PERSON> Piero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Piero </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Floriana </PERSON>, the statement said <PERSON> Piero </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Lina </PERSON>, who was not <ORGANIZATION> Ferrari </ORGANIZATION>'s wife, was also at the deathbed. His wife had died in 1978. At <ORGANIZATION> Ferrari </ORGANIZATION>'s request, the announcement of his death was made after the private funeral rites and burial today in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cataldo </LOCATION>, near this northern city, according to the <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The founder and chairman of the company that bears his name and makes luxury sports cars and Formula One racers once dreamed of becoming an opera star or a sportswriter. But his first love was automobiles, and his drivers whipped the prancing black horse that decorates his bright red racing cars to victory on every major track in the world. `` It's true that I have never met any man whom I thought altogether resembled me _ but only because my faults are so enormous,'' he wrote in his autobiography. `` I have yet to meet anyone quite so stubborn as myself and animated by this overpowering passion that leaves me no time for thought or anything else. I have in fact no interest in life outside racing cars,'' he wrote. `` I have never gone on a real trip, never taken a holiday. The best holiday for me is spent in my workshops when nearly everybody else is on vacation.'' His factory, in the town of <LOCATION> Maranello </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Modena </LOCATION>, turns out about 1,300 cars a year. Hundreds of customers, book the Ferrari models years in advance and pay as much as $ 150,000, and more, for the cars. Born in February 1898, <ORGANIZATION> Ferrari </ORGANIZATION> entered motor racing in 1919 and drove with the <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romeo </ORGANIZATION> team for 11 years. But he never became a great driver because of a fatal flaw _ he could not bear to ruin an engine to win a race. <PERSON> Ferrari </PERSON> founded his Maranello auto works in 1946, letting other men win races in cars he produced. At the time, about 400 workers toiled painstakingly on the silvery engines. Some crankshafts were sculpted by hand out of steel, each requiring more than 80 hours of work. His drivers drove the racers to more than 4,000 victories and the <ORGANIZATION> Ferrari </ORGANIZATION> team picked up 13 world titles, including nine in the Formula One category since 1952. <PERSON> Ferrari </PERSON> was forced to reduce his business activities in February when he developed influenza. Last month, a company spokesman confirmed that <PERSON> Ferrari </PERSON> was being treated at home for kidney troubles and `` for ailments typical of his age.'' <PERSON> Ferrari </PERSON> was an avowed agnostic who made no secret of his aversion for the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION>, which had criticized him for his stoic attitude toward the deaths of his drivers in fiery accidents on the track. However, in June, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> toured the company's plant, took a spin in one of the sports cars and spoke by phone for five minutes with the bed-ridden Ferrari.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Monday abolished the state tourism directorate and said major hotels, restaurants and other facilities will be sold off or leased to the private sector. A decree by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the state-run assets to be privatized included seven major hotels in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the war-battered southern port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and the northern city of <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION>, including two Sheratons. The <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> Sheraton was damaged by shell and rocket fire during a major Iranian offensive against <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in early 1987, in which some of the heaviest fighting in the nearly 8-year-old Gulf war took place. Monday's announcement came as Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leaders prepared to meet in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Aug. 25 for peace talks under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> auspices. The Iraqi move to sell off its tourist facilities is part of President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s drive to develop his socialist-run country's private sector by selling off state-owned assets to stimulate the economy, badly battered by the war with neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. No statistics were immediately available, but tourism to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, rich in archaeological sites dating back at least 6,000 years, has been badly affected by the conflict. The hotels will still be run by their parent chains in accordance with an agreement signed with the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government, officials said. But managers at the hotels said they did not yet know if the facilities will be sold to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s private sector or be handed over to their parent companies. According to the <ORGANIZATION> RCC </ORGANIZATION> decision, taken Aug. 2 but only announced Monday, those hotels which will not be sold will be leased for 25 years to private companies. The decree said a special commission will supervise the sale or lease of the state-owned utilities, which also include a tourist complex in <LOCATION> Habaniya </LOCATION> west of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and several modern resort complexes in the northern mountains, scene of heavy fighting in the war.

 Months after white collar workers at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> voted to unionize, a tense labor battle continues, with the <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> school being accused of union-busting as its seeks to throw out the vote. A National Labor Relations Board administrative law judge was scheduled to open hearings today on <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s challenge of the May 17 vote that created a 3,300-member union. The hearings are expected to take two weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> alleges that organizers used illegal tactics, including intimidation of opponents and electioneering at the polls, to win the election by 44 votes, 1,530 to 1,486. The university wants the agency to invalidate the election. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clerical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> deny the charges. `` What's really going on here is we beat them, and they know it, and everybody knows it,'' said <PERSON> Kristine </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rondeau </PERSON>, an organizer. `` Our union is now a permanent part of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and the only remaining question is, what's the future relationship going to be _ peace or war? <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s got to decide,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who coordinated the university's response to the union, conceded that the school `` is in a difficult position'' because `` it's a liberal institution'' and `` the administration of the university is not reflexively anti-union and would not like to be thought of as reflexively anti-union.'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmetz </PERSON>, an administrative law judge from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, who is conducting the hearings, is not likely to reach a decision until mid-autumn, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, supervisory examiner in the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office. The union drive, which began in 1975, was closely watched by national labor leaders as a bellwether for organizing white-collar workers. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said administrators believe there is `` strong evidence'' that union organizers acted improperly during the election. She said the violations include `` the union's maintenance of lists on which they checked off voters, their interrogation of voters as to how they voted, the escorting of voters to the polls, electioneering on the way to the polls and at the polls, and the providing of things of value _ such as medical care and plane fares _ to get union supporters to vote.'' <PERSON> Rondeau </PERSON> said the union conducted a legitimate get-out-the-vote operation, and nothing more. `` They're saying we were at the polls keeping lists, and we were not,'' she said. `` They're saying we were intimidating people. That's incredible, no matter how much you stretch it.''

 An antiques dealer says he intends to keep the 24-inch doll he purchased for $ 48,000, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> record. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Birch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Runville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, bought the ceramic German doll, with blue-gray eyes, during an auction here Saturday. The previous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> record for a doll was $ 45,000 paid for a 19th century French doll sold at a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> auction two years ago. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s boy doll, which sports a top hat, is known as a <PERSON> Kammer </PERSON> and Reinhardt Model 106. It was made about 1910 from bisque ceramic. `` I bought him because I've been collecting the <PERSON> Kammer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON> series for 25 years,'' said the 41-year-old <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Theriault </PERSON>, who conducted the auction, said the doll had been expected to sell for about $ 25,000. `` That was exciting,'' <PERSON> Theriault </PERSON> said. `` It was nothing we anticipated.''

<HEAD>Peasants Raid Forest, Cut Down Trees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Peasants in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have cut down and stolen more than 10,000 trees from a state-run forest since the beginning of the year, an official newspaper said. The Legal Daily said Monday that illegal logging has been increasing at the <LOCATION> Wugong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> forest in <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> province because forestry officials refuse to punish the peasants. The report said in the past peasants used to sneak up the mountain and cut one or two trees down. Now, it said, `` they steal dozens of trees and even hundreds of trees at a time.'' The peasants use the wood to build houses and for fuel. On April 19, the paper said, 2,000 peasants from a nearby village looted more than 200 cubic yards of trees. Five days later, peasants again entered the forest and cut down trees. This time forestry guards were injured, the paper said. The report said the <LOCATION> Wugong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> forest has 49,444 acres of trees and is one of the country's main producers of wood products. The Chinese press has said that illegal logging poses serious problems for the environment and the development of agriculture. Illegal logging quickens soil erosion and creates conditions where small amounts of rain can cause major floods. Last year, 247,100 acres of forests in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were destroyed by illegal logging and 91 million yuan, or about $ 24.5 million, in trees were stolen, the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily reported in March. Monday's report said the problem could not be solved in <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> province because officials there are too lenient.

<HEAD>Government Announces Second Phase of Anti-Inflation Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has announced it is extending an emergency inflation-busting program until Nov. 30, President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s last day in office. A statement released by the president's office Sunday night said the government would maintain its 6-month-old freeze on the peso currency exchange rate and prices for government-regulated goods and services through the end of the administration. The government said it would not increase the federal minimum wage, also frozen since Feb. 29. But it said the national sales tax for processed foods and medicines, as well as taxes on rents, would be lowered in some cases to bolster workers' real income. Implemented in December, the first phase of the so-called Economic Solidarity Pact between the government, labor and business sectors expires Aug. 31. The new measures announced Sunday go into effect Sept. 1. `` What we have achieved with the Economic Solidarity Pact is not artificial, nor is it casual, nor has it responded to immediate political objectives,'' de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said at a ceremony attended by members of his cabinet and the heads of leading business and labor organizations at the presidential residence. The program was unveiled as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s inflation rate was soaring to a record 159.2 percent in 1987. On Aug. 10, the central <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> announced the Pact had succeeded in bringing consumer prices down to a 1.7 percent increase in July, the lowest monthly rise in seven years. Inflation for the first seven months of the year reached 43.3 percent, while the annual rate between July 1987 and July was 122.3 percent, the central bank said. The measures announced on Sunday include: _ Prices for gasoline, telephone service, natural gas, electricity and other goods and services sold by the government will remain stable; _ The peso exchange rate with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar will remain frozen; _ The government will reduce its Value Added Tax from six to zero percent on processed foods and medicines, with retailers required to pass the savings on to consumers; _ The daily minimum wage, currently about $ 3.50 in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, will remain frozen; _ Taxes on rents will be reduced for those workers earning less than four times the daily minimum wage; _ By Sept. 1, retailers will be obliged to lower prices for their goods an average of 3 percent compared to prices in effect between <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> said the government would continue its attempts to alleviate shortages in certain goods, such as meats, that have appeared since the officially voluntary pact went into effect. But he warned the government `` will not abandon the use of instruments and responsibilities of authority in necessary cases'' to enforce compliance with price guidelines, the statement said. `` The final objective of the fight against inflation is to reach rates of price increases similar to those of our principal trade partners,'' de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said. The timing of the announcement was important for the president, economists here agreed. The government wanted to stop costly speculation that it planned to devalue the peso against the dollar. On the controlled market last week, the peso traded at 2,241 to buy and 2,273 to sell. The announcement also provides two weeks' lead time for reaction to subside before de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> gives his final state of the nation speech on Sept. 1. The president is virtually certain to be replaced by <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, his former planning and budget minister, on Dec. 1. The 3-month extension of the minimum wage freeze and lowering of retail prices represented a compromise by both government and labor. Only Saturday, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, president of the umbrella <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said his organization would not abide by a renewal of the pact unless the government either raised salaries to compensate for inflation since February or forced the private sector to reduce its retail prices. Sunday's presidential statement quoted <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> as saying the pact's second phase provided `` a greater protection for the real salary of the workers.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has laid off 128 more employees from one of its operations in this <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community, reducing the company's work force to only 32. Of the 128 workers laid off Friday, 50 were laid off indefinitely, while the 78 others were offered new jobs or transfers to other Peabody operations. The layoffs bring to 540 the number of local workers eliminated in the past three years. <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, operates 40 surface and underground mines in nine states. Another 85 administrative and clerical workers throughout the company were also laid off. The latest layoffs occurred because of a reduced demand for high-sulfur <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> coal, said company spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON>. Large users of coal have continued to switch to other forms of energy such as nuclear energy or use lower-sulfur coal from western or eastern states, he said. `` We have reduced the number of employees at the mine level over the past several years in response to the highly competitive market for coal,'' company president <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Friday in a statement. `` The layoffs bring our support staff more in line with the current active mining employee levels within these operations,'' he said. Further layoffs will depend on government regulation, <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> said. High-sulfur coal contributes pollutants to the air that need to be reduced in order to comply with federal clean air legislation, he said. `` Further tightening of clean-air legislation will not help,'' <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> said. In October 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> laid off 100 management employees at what was then its <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> headquarters and 70 people in its <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Division, which includes the <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> office. The company's headquarters was moved in April 1986 to <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. A total of 151 miners were laid off at two Belleville-area mines in 1987 The company's Illinois Division office is responsible for seven mines _ six in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, with four in the <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION> area, and one in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. At the end of 1987, those mines employed 2,844 and produced 10.8 million tons of coal, <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> said. That was down from 4,890 employees and coal production of 16 million tons of coal from 15 mines three years ago.

<HEAD>City Preparing $500 Million Gamble to Incinerate Garbage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Critics of a new $ 500 million <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> garbage incineration and electrical generation plan are pointing out that other cities have canceled similar plans worth an estimated $ 4 billion in the last 18 months. `` The technology itself is a dog,'' complained one critic, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipsett </PERSON> of the Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste. Despite uneven success with such garbage power plants, including two already built in the city, proponents say as many as 10 incinerators would be built under the plan, which also calls for the city to sell the steam and electricity produced to defray costs. <PERSON> Lipsett </PERSON> and other critics contend that garbage plants emit cancer-causing chemicals and produce tons of ash laden with poisons such as lead and arsenic, and that taxpayers routinely get burned because such incinerators run over budget, break down repeatedly and fail to meet optimistic projections on how much revenue they will generate. Industry officials, however, counter by pointing to the success of a $ 288 million, state-of-the-art incinerator now operating in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, that has helped that city avert a garbage crisis. `` You'll find success stories where projects have come in under budget and ahead of schedule and have operated as designed,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says 140 municipal garbage incinerators are operating and that another 200 are planned. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> now buries about 85 percent of its garbage _ about three million tons annually _ in landfills. About 13 percent is incinerated at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s one working plant on the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> and the remainder is recycled. But with the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimating landfills will be full by 1991, the city has turned its attention to waste-to-energy plants. The city plan calls for as much as 55 percent of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s waste to be burned by the year 2000 at between two and 10 plants, depending on the size of each. An 18-month study already is underway to determine how to pay for those plants and where they should be located. The city, meanwhile, has had mixed results with incinerators. The Northwest Side facility has burned garbage 24 hours a day for 17 years, consuming about 1,000 tons a day, and producing industrial steam that's sold to a candy company nearby for $ 1 million a year. But a second plant on the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, built at a cost of $ 27 million, was mothballed in 1979 after only 1 -LCB- years of irregular service. Mayoral aide <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says the city has learned something from both and will put that knowledge to use when it moves forward with the new plan. `` We're not going to be reckless and support unproven technology,'' he said.

 Stock prices slipped this morning in slow trading, weakened by growing pressure for higher interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 7.29 points to 2,030.23 as of 11 a.m. EDT on Wall Street. Among broader market indicators, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index of all listed issues fell 0.53 to 148.00.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported that its profit after taxes rose 12 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, helped by modestly higher sales and an advertising campaign. The nation's second-largest retailer said Monday that its second-quarter profit increased to $ 162.8 million, or 81 cents a share, from $ 145.4 million, or 71 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Sales for the second quarter ended July 27 were up 6 percent, to $ 6.68 billion from $ 6.30 billion a year earlier. `` While the sales increase in our K mart discount stores was fairly modest, we are encouraged by the results from two of our strategic programs,'' Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> said. He said the company has been placing great emphasis on lowering shelf prices. `` In addition, our once-a-week advertising program is gaining momentum and giving new dimension to our various merchandising programs,'' <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> said. In the first six months of its fiscal year, K mart's profit rose 8.7 percent _ to $ 283.6 million, or $ 1.41 a share, from $ 260.9 million, or $ 1.28 a share. First-half sales increased 5.3 percent, to $ 12.53 billion from $ 11.90 billion a year earlier. K mart is the second-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailer after <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, with sales of $ 25.6 billion in 1987. As of July 27, 1988, it operated 2,233 K mart discount stores, 1,163 Waldenbooks stores, 122 Builders Square home-improvement outlets and 257 Pay Less Drug stores.

 Grain and soybean futures opened sharply higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, but analysts said the market remained shaky following Friday's volatile session. Soybeans for delivery in May opened up the 30-cents-a-bushel daily limit, then retreated slightly. `` I would n't read anything into what's happened so far,'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a New York-based grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said shortly after the opening. `` The market really needs some time to sort itself out.'' Crop futures finished lower on Friday despite an overwhelmingly bullish crop report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Weather forecasts called for mostly hot and dry weather in the Corn Belt this week, but <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said traders also were looking for evidence of new export business and further drought damage to the crops before bidding prices up decisively. In early trading, wheat was 4 cents to 5 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.84 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 2 -RCB- cents to 6 \ cents higher with September at $ 2.90 a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.81 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 -RCB- cents to 26 cents higher with August at $ 8.68 a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ahead of this afternoon's <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> monthly 7-state cattle-on-feed report.

 The co-publishers of the <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> have been ordered to pay the court costs incurred by their rival legal newspaper in a dispute over circulation. Attorneys <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stayton </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Inez </PERSON>, have been ordered to pay legal expenses exceeding $ 11,000 for <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcum </PERSON>, publisher of the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Countian </PERSON>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Paintsville </LOCATION> also ruled that they must pay <PERSON> Marcum </PERSON>'s costs if they appeal the order. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said they must pay the legal bills because they continued to press the circulation case after it was settled in March, 1987. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stayton </PERSON> are the Mercury's co-publishers. `` The continued litigation as set forth can only lead this court to believe that counsel for the Mercury caused the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Countian </PERSON> to incur additional legal expenses for no valid reason other than to harass the plaintiff,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said Friday in his 39-page decision. The decision was the result of a hearing held last December. The case began in February, 1987, when <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiscal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> voted to designate the Mercury as the county's legal newspaper based on figures presented by that newspaper. The move took the county's legal business away from <PERSON> Marcum </PERSON>'s feisty <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Countian </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcum </PERSON> called <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s circulation figures `` bogus'' and sued the next day. In his ruling, <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said that the Mercury's press run of 2,800 included hundreds of papers given away free in <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s law offices in <LOCATION> Prestonsburg </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hindman </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Countian </PERSON>'s circulation is about 4,350, <PERSON> Marcum </PERSON> said. On March 13, 1987, fiscal court voted 5-0 to reinstate the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Countian </PERSON> as the legal newspaper. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> ruled that even though the circulation dispute was settled when the magistrates reversed their decision, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stayton </PERSON> continued to press the case, forcing <PERSON> Marcum </PERSON> to incur additional legal costs for depositions and responding to motions. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> invoked a civil judicial procedure rule requiring attorneys who file so-called frivolous lawsuits or motions to pay for defendants' legal expenses.

 The number of working domestic oil and gas rigs fell by five this week to total 940, <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. In last week's tally, the rig count jumped by 51 to total 945. A year ago this week, the count was 998, the company said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' rig count, the widely watched industry index of drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.

<TEXT>
 A Washington-based investor group today launched a tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> even though the apparel and furniture maker rejected the $ 2.69 billion bid a week ago. The group, which is led by the Rales brothers, is offering $ 70 a share in cash, which values the company at $ 2.69 billion. <PERSON> Rales </PERSON> and their associates, however, already own about 8.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s 38.4 million common shares outstanding. Last week <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> rejected the offer and took measures to strengthen its defenses against unwanted suitors, including amending the company's anti-takeover `` poison pill'' so that it takes effect if a suitor acquires 15 percent or more of the company's stock and makes a bid prohibitively expensive. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> said it was continuing to persue a restructuring plan that would include selling the company's faltering apparel operations and paying shareholders a special dividend The Rales brothers, operating through <ORGANIZATION> Cardinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to provide $ 500 million in financing. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> also said it is `` highly confident'' it will be able to raise another $ 2.15 billion from a syndicate of other banks. The group headed by <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rales </PERSON>, 37, and his brother, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 31, approached the <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> board with a $ 64-a-share takeover bid last month. The group sweetened the offer to $ 70 a share but again was rebuffed. Some analysts have estimated that <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> might be worth as much as $ 78 a share. On Wall Street, <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> jumped $ 2.25 to $ 72.25 in active, early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Just a few months ago, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s economic `` disease'' of rampant inflation, sky-high interest rates and persistent unemployment was pronounced cured y just about everyone except the Conservative government's staunchest critics. Today, the economy is suffering something of a relapse, exhibiting that old familiar symptom, higher inflation, and the government admits it is troubling. In addition, a hike in interest rates and a sharp widening of the trade deficit are worrying economists. Ironically, the symptoms' cause is the economy's vigorous growth, which is stretching resources and driving up prices. Like its trading ally, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> faces the threat that its economy could overheat into recession. The peak came in March when the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s top official, Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, announced the first surplus budget in nearly 20 years and slashed the top income tax rate to 40 percent from 60 percent. Since then, the attention has turned instead to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s annual inflation rate, which, fed by strong consumer spending, has jumped from 3.5 percent to 4.6 percent in June. In his budget speech, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> had forecast an inflation rate of 4 percent by the end of the year. To combat higher inflation _ Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s No 1 economic priority _ the government has pushed interest rates up more than 3 percentage points since early June. `` Whatever action is necessary to keep inflation under control, this government will take,'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> told members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in late July, characterizing the pickup as `` modest but unacceptable.'' Strength in the dollar gave the government room to raise interest rates without pushing the British pound dangerously high. But the pound, which has been trading at about 3.20 West German marks, remains well above a rate of 3 marks which the government long had protected. The pound broke through that ceiling in March, raising concerns that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s export competitiveness might be hurt. Indeed, the trade deficit is much worse than <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> had forecast. For the first six months of 1988, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had a current account deficit of 5.6 billion pounds -LRB- $ 9.6 billion -RRB-, compared with a 1.6 billion pound -LRB- $ 2.6 billion -RRB- deficit in all of 1987. The current account includes `` invisible'' trade such as services and overseas investment earnings. In his budget speech, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> had forecast a trade deficit of 4 billion pounds -LRB- $ 7 billion -RRB- for all of 1988. `` Things have deteriorated,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>, an economist at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` The major part of the reason for the deterioration has been the way the economy has been growing so much faster than expected.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, an economist with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grieveson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said `` domestic demand is just growing too quickly for its own good.'' The latest survey conducted by the polling organization Market and <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, showed that in July, for the first time since February 1987, more people thought the state of the economy would get worse rather than better over the next year. Economists expect <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s gross domestic product _ its total output of goods and services _ to grow between 3.5 percent and 4 percent this year, faster than the 3 percent forecast by <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> in March, and following growth of 4.4 percent in 1987. On top of the troubling symptoms, there have been recurrent reports of a rift between Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> over currency exchange policy. These have been fueled by the pound's rise and the government's negotiations with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s former economic adviser, Sir <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, for him to return to her Downing Street office next year Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> advocates free-market policies while <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> favors managing exchange rates through direct intervention in the markets and the adjustment of interest rates. However, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> survived a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> reshuffle by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in late July and now appears likely to remain until at least after next spring's budget. But the economic outlook remains worrying, <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON> said. Inflation will peak at 6 percent early next year, interest rates might move higher into the double digits, and the trade deficit probably will balloon to 10 billion pounds -LRB- $ 17.2 billion -RRB- in 1988, <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON> predicted. The government remains upbeat. `` The difficulties that beset us are difficulties we have successfully dealt with in the past, and will do so again, without drama, and without interrupting the steady progress we have already achieved,'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Rate Has Fallen For Two Years, But Critics Claim It Is Massaged</HEAD>

 Thanks to a strong economy, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s persistently high unemployment rate has fallen sharply, but critics claim the government is massaging the figures to make them ook even better than they are. Opponents of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government agree that unemployment is down, but say exaggeration in the degree of improvement is encouraging apathy toward the unemployed. The jobless rate has been falling for two years, reaching 8.4 percent in June, its lowest point in nearly seven years, the Department of Employment says. Unemployment has fallen to 2.38 million people from a peak of 11.5 percent, or about 3.31 million in June 1986. The decline is the fastest among major Western industrialized nations, the government says. But the Unemployment Unit, a private research and lobby organization, says the rate would be 10.6 percent, representing 3.03 million people, if the calculation method were the same as when the Conservatives first came into power in 1979. The British figures compare with a West German rate of 8.9 percent in June, which is unchanged from two years earlier, and a French rate of 10.9 percent in May, which is up from 10.7 percent two years before. An <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who requested anonymity, said: `` We're still reasonably confident that it -LRB- ours -RRB- is an accurate measure of unemployment.'' Lawmaker <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Meacher </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman on unemployment, said: `` Unemployment has indeed been going down over the last two years, but only about half as fast as the government has been claiming.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, a columnist for the Independent newspaper, wrote: `` If ... the calculations were done differently, it is doubtful whether the government could claim, or would receive, anything like the credit that the media and the public now bestow upon it.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Convery </PERSON>, a director of the Unemployment Unit, said Britons have become `` a little bit anesthetized,'' partly because they generally are feeling better off economically, and partly because the government has scored `` several sizable propaganda victories.'' National unemployment registers have been the source for unemployment statistics in all Common Market countries except <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, the Unemployment Unit said. In 1982, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> alone began basing its unemployment rate on the number claiming unemployment benefits, rather than the number registered as unemployed, it said. Since 1979, the government has made 22 changes in the way it measures joblessness, all except one of which have reduced the official unemployment rate, the Unemployment Unit said. The government denies that it has made that many changes or that its alterations are designed to make the numbers look better. In a recent monthly unemployment report, the government said it began counting as employed those people who are in government training programs. That reduced the unemployment rate by 0.1 percent. The unit said the government has removed from the unemployment benefit lists jobless men over age 60 who receive other kinds of benefits. Part-time workers, whose numbers are increasing, have always been counted as employed, and many jobless married women are n't eligible for unemployment benefits, it said Another way of measuring unemployment is to conduct surveys which ask adults questions about their employment status. This method is used monthly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the government uses the method once a year, and reveals the results a year later. By the survey method, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had an unemployment rate of 10.7 percent in the spring of 1987. By the government's regular method, the rate was 10.8 percent. `` They are so close that it shows that our own measure is accurate,'' the department spokesman said.

 Stock prices finished sharply lower Monday amid growing fears that the British economy was overheating. The release of two British economic reports, which showed the British economy growing at a greater-than-expected pace, caused many investors to dump stock and flee to the sidelines. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed off 26.6 points, or 1.4 percent, at 1,816.8, slightly above its worst level for the day of 1,816.6. Volume was a relatively light 346 million shares, compared with Friday's 495 million shares. Also depressing British stock, dealers said, were sliding prices on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where the Dow Jones industrial average was off around 19 points at the 2,019 level as <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading drew to a close. The British government reported Monday that retail sales rose 2 percent in July and that industrial production fell 0.9 percent in June. The figures sparked concern that a continuing boom in consumer demand coupled with capacity constraints in industry could further fuel inflationary pressures in the British economy, dealers said. That raised fears that British commercial banks' base lending rate, which has been increased seven times, to 11 percent from 7.5 percent in early June, would be pushed up even higher.

<HEAD>Hormone Scandal Involving Calf Breeders Grips West Germany, Could

<TEXT>
 A West German scandal involving the use of illegal hormones to spur the growth of calves may spread to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, officials and news reports said Monday. Discovery of the illegal hormone use has led to charges of an international `` hormone mafia'' and the arrest of a major veal producer in northwestern <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` There is an illegal market for animal drugs that is causing mischief both within the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and outside of it,'' said <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthiesen </PERSON>, agriculture minister for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION>. The main substance at issue is testosterone, the male hormone that is suspected of being a cancer-causing agent in large doses. Authorities last week arrested veal producer <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Hying </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Borken </LOCATION> in the northwestern part of the country after discovering illegal hormone use. <PERSON> Hying </PERSON> was arrested on criminal charges of violating the country's food and health laws that ban the use of hormones. Prosecutors say <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigger </PERSON>, another veal producer from the same area, is suspected of using similar banned substances. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rentmeister </PERSON>, a spokesman for the city of <LOCATION> Borken </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Wigger </PERSON> kept `` a thousand or more calves'' in the nearby <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martsch </PERSON>, a spokesman for the environmentalist Greens party in the affected state of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION>, said: `` There is a possibility Wigger had business dealings with <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.'' He did not reveal further details during a press conference in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION>. The Hamburg-based <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> magazine and the <ORGANIZATION> Westdeutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio station of <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> said the hormones themselves came from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Officials say they fear the scandal will grow. <PERSON> Matthiesen </PERSON> told reporters on Sunday he is convinced there is an `` international hormone mafia'' behind the illegal use. `` We have had many, many indications, not only in the last few days but also for several months, that confirm this view,'' the state minister said. `` There are ties going beyond national boundaries.'' West German offficials say it's the largest hormone scandal in the country's nearly 40-year history. The issue is particularly sensitive for West Germans, who are wary of food additives and similar substances. Health food firms also have been experiencing sharp growth in recent years, while news accounts still chronicle the lingering effects of the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident on the nation's food supply. <PERSON> Matthiesen </PERSON> on Friday ordered the confiscation of about 14,000 calves belonging to Wigger because of the suspected use of testosterone. Testosterone is the principal male sex hormone, and it is responsible for various male sex characteristics. Its use is banned throughout the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wigger </PERSON> says that needle marks found on a sampling of his calves were only for routine immunizations. Also last week, in a separate action, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION> officials accused calf breeder Hying of using testosterone on thousands of his calves. Officials ordered the slaughter of 4,200 of <PERSON> Hying </PERSON>'s calves that tested postive for the hormone. More than 10,000 others were also being tested. Hying remained in jail Monday afternoon pending further investigation. Local prosecutor <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Deupmann </PERSON> told reporters Sunday that 500 of the calves remained unaccounted for after several days of investigations. `` We ca n't exclude the possibility that these calves have already been slaughtered, prepared and have reached the markets,'' <PERSON> Deupmann </PERSON> added. Both Wigger and Hying have their businesses in towns located less than 10 kilometers -LRB- six miles -RRB- from the Dutch border. While experts say that testosterone is a suspected cancer-causing agent, West German scientists say that quantities of the substance found in the calves pose no danger to humans.

<HEAD>CIA Report Says Inflation Up Last Spring in US, Industrial

<TEXT>
 Inflation, as measured by consumer prices, rose last spring in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its main trading partners, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> report made available Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> found that while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation fell from 3.7 percent in 1987 to an annualized rate of 3.4 percent in the first quarter, it rose in the March-June period to 4.8 percent. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s inflation rate fell from a 4.4 percent rate last year to 3.2 percent in the first quarter, but also picked up in the second quarter, to 5 percent, the report said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had a 4.1 percent inflation rate in 1987. The level dropped to 2.4 percent in the first quarter and rose to 6.1 percent in the second quarter, the report said. Among other major industrialized nations tracked in the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> report, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s first-quarter inflation rate fell by 2.1 percent from a 0.1 percent rate in 1987 but rose to 2.8 percent in the second quarter. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 1987 inflation of 0.3 percent doubled to 0.6 percent in the first quarter and rose to 1.9 percent in the spring. The rise was less marked in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, countries more usually inclined to inflation. The French rate of 2.8 percent in the second quarter of 1988 was an increase over the winter rate of 2.3 percent, but still below the 3.3 percent of 1987. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the rate was 4.6 percent in 1987, after falling steadily since the 14.9 percent level of 1983. It was down to 3.1 percent in the first quarter of this year but then rose again to 4.5 percent in the second three months. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s twice-monthly `` Economic and Energy Indicators'' for July 29 did not provide figures for smaller countries. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, which does, says inflation on the consumer level among 21 industrial countries rose to an annualized rate of 3 percent in May from 2.9 percent of 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> said the average inflation level for 116 other countries, mostly in the Third World, was 39.8 percent in 1987. It increased to a rate of 55.7 percent in January, however few figures for later months were available. Financial authorities have been especially worried about <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, with the biggest economy in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the biggest debt in the Third World. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> reported Brazilian inflation at more than 229 percent last year and rising at an annual rate of just under 500 percent in April. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s rate was 131 percent in 1987, having risen steadily throughout the year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. It has been reported rising since, but the fund had no 1988 figures for <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in its statistics for August. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, on the other hand, has been keeping its rate below 3 percent in recent years, although it reached that level in 1987 and reported an annual rate of 7.4 percent this June, the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, where the inflation rate hit a high of 11,750 percent in 1985, was down to 15 percent last year and has been reporting between 8 percent and 9 percent in 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> said. The current inflation front-runner among the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>'s members is <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, with an annual rate of more than 3,766 percent in June.

 Fear of rising interest rates bedeviled the stock market again today and depressed the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to the lowest closing level in nearly three months. Trading was extremely light, which brokers called a reflection of slack summer business, the extrordinarily hot weather and skepticism about the market's prospects in the aftermath of the sharp losses last week. `` The sellers are just getting plain tired. They're just getting worn out,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, manager of over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There's no bids.'' Stronger-than-expected industrial production figures released by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> set the mood for the market's weakness by raising anxiety that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will raise interest rates further to slow economic growth. Last week the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s hike in the discount rate from 6 percent to 6.5 percent rattled the stock and bond markets and contributed to a 81.61-point weekly drop in the Dow average, the biggest weekly decline since early spring.

<HEAD>OPEC Head Sees 1 Million Barrel Per Day Cut After Cease-Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> General Secretary <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said Monday the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> cease-fire should lower <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production by around 1 million barrels a day, enabling the organization to solve its overproduction problem without drastic output cuts. Oil traders reacted skeptically to the statement and oil prices were little changed. The September contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, rose 9 cents to $ 15.61 a barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, who is touring Latin American oil producers, said he will go to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> following the scheduled Aug. 20 cease-fire to try to convince the former enemies to accept equal production quotas as they end their eight-year war. He said said the organization could opt for a new lower benchmark price `` of, say, $ 17'' in its November regular meeting as an alternative to cutting production. He added that the organization's price committee would meet sometime after the last week in August but before the Nov. 21 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministerial conference. `` The outcome of the cease-fire is anyone's guess, but my opinion is that -LRB- <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> -RRB- will be rational and what they will rationally want is higher prices to build their economies,'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> told a press conference. `` By bringing <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s production to equal that of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, this will reduce <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production without reducing the temporary quota of anyone -LRB- else -RRB-. ... With that policy, we will be able to strengthen prices without a lower production level,'' he said. `` I will try my best to convince <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to accept parity,'' said <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, who is the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> oil minister. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s quota is 2,369,000 barrels per day. He said a parity agreement would `` at least'' reduce <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s production by 600,000 to 700,000 barrels per day, while an end to oil loans to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> by its allies <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> could result in a total cutback of 1 million barrels He said he would visit both nations in the last week of August and would report the results of his talks to the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> price committee, which would then meet prior to the organization's November regular conference He said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> might decide in November for `` a higher production level but at a lower price of, say, $ 17'' per barrel. `` What strategy we take depends on the -LRB- regular -RRB- conference,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s current target price is $ 18 per barrel, although actual market prices are $ 14 to $ 15 a barrel.

<HEAD>Drexel Employees Owned Stake in Boesky Arbitrage Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of 27 employees of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, including top dealmaker <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, owned a stake in the arbitrage firm of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> beginning in 1984, according to a published report Monday. The previously unknown financial tie raises questions of potential conflicts of interest for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, according to lawyers and Wall Street executives interviewed by the Wall Street Journal. From 1984 to 1986, when the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employee group held a stake in <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s operation, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was Wall Street's most powerful takeover speculator and traded in many stocks about which <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> had valuable inside information. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees were only passive investors with no role in the operations <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s firm. The Journal said the tie was revealed in public documents filed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; private offering documents; and people familiar with the relationship. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was sentenced to three years in prison last December on a criminal charge stemming from the government's investigation into wrongdoing on Wall Street. He previously agreed to pay a $ 100 million penalty to settle a civil complaint of insider trading and was banished from the securities business. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approved civil charges of securities-law violations against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and three other <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees, but so far the charges have not been filed. The charges are based largely on allegations of illegal dealings between <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the investigation. The Journal said people close to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> say the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees, through a general partnership known as <ORGANIZATION> Camro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, invested $ 1 million in the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> firm, <ORGANIZATION> Seemala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in 1984, and received $ 3 million for their stake in 1986. <PERSON> Camro </PERSON> was made up largely of employees of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s junk bond operations in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the Journal said. A <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON>, told the Journal, `` The investment was made over four years ago with the full knowledge and consent of'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was fully disclosed and the amount involved was only 1 percent of the equity -LRB- of <LOCATION> Seemala </LOCATION> -RRB- based on book value.'' <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> described the investment as `` strictly passive,'' meaning the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> investors were not involved in the business of <LOCATION> Seemala </LOCATION>. He said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shriver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, a law firm working for <LOCATION> Seemala </LOCATION>, proposed the investment for tax reasons. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, declined comment Monday. After the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employee group sold its stake in <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s arbitrage firm in 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> took its own stake in <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s successor <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 660 million in notes as part of <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s effort to raise $ 1 billion in debt and equity for his new firm, received $ 24 million in investment banking fees, and invested $ 5 million in the new firm.

 <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, the Anglo-Dutch household products group, said Monday its second-quarter net profit jumped 12 percent, with most lines of business contributing to the improvement. <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, whose brands include Lever, <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Chesebrough-Pond </PERSON>'s, said net profit in the three months ended June 30 rose to $ 410 million from $ 367 million in the same period a year earlier. Sales gained 5 percent to $ 8.25 billion from $ 7.84 billion in the year-earlier period. Those results are based on translating results into dollars for both periods at the rates of exchange that applied at the end of 1987: one British pound equal to 3.33 Dutch guilders equal to $ 1.87. `` The second quarter showed a stronger improvement over 1987 than that achieved in the first quarter,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Angus </PERSON>, chairman of the company's British arm, <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most parts of the business contributed to this result.'' `` The outlook for the year as a whole is encouraging,'' the chairman added.

Sales increased 4 percent to $ 15.9 billion from $ 15.4 billion a year earlier.

 Fear of rising interest rates bedeviled the stock market Monday and depressed the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to its lowest closing level in nearly three months. The barometer of 30 blue-chip stocks, still wobbly from its 81.61-point decline last week, dropped 33.25 to close at 2,004.27. The last time the Dow average closed lower was May 27, when it finished at 1,956.44. Broader market indicators also finished sharply lower. `` You still have this global interest rate pressure,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, head trader at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` That's why the market got whacked.'' The mood was set for the decline by a government report that July industrial production rose 0.8 percent, double the June figure and much higher than market expectations. The report raised fear that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s credit-tightening last week, which jacked up interest rates to the highest level of the year, was n't sufficient to quell inflation pressures in the economy Brokers said trading remained extremely sluggish, reflecting a broad lack of interest in stocks by institutional investors that are the biggest influences in the market. `` There are real heavy cash positions out there,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ianiro </PERSON>, a partner on the trading desk at <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` People are just waiting for all these news events.'' A key event anticipated by many market participants was the June merchandise trade deficit figure, scheduled for release by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> before the market opened Tuesday. But there was a widespread view that whatever the deficit, it was more likely to hurt stocks than help them. A number vastly higher than the $ 10.9 billion shortfall in May could weaken the dollar and encourage a selloff in stocks, some brokers argued. Conversely, a sharply lower figure could also hurt stocks by reinforcing fears that the domestic economy is growing too fast. Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4-to-1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,194 down, 345 up and 432 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> floor totaled 128.56 million shares, down from 176.96 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 150.33 million shares. Technology and computer stocks were among the biggest losers, led by <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>, which dropped 3 to 97, its lowest point in nearly two years.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Soar On Hot, Dry Weather Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures posted their strongest gains in a week Monday in response to predictions that crops in the drought-weary Corn Belt would bake in triple-digit heat for most of this week. On other markets, most livestock and meat futures rose; precious metals advanced; energy futures were higher; and stock-index futures retreated. Monday's midday weather forecasts, coming on the heels of a hot, mostly dry weekend in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, stoked fears of further damage to the crops and helped push most corn, oat and soybean contracts up their permitted daily limits on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Meteorologists said the same weather pattern that had made the spring and early summer unseasonally warm and dry was reestablishing itself and intensifying, promising at least several more days of searing heat in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` We're going to have extreme heat right into Thursday, 100 to 110 degrees in the Corn Belt,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Notis </PERSON>, a private forecaster based in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a six-to-10-day outlook predicting above-normal temperatures but normal to above-normal rainfall for the Farm Belt during the first five days of next week. Analysts said the soybean crop was nearing the end of its vulnerable flowering and pod-setting stage, a four-to-six-week period during which weather plays a crucial role in determining yields. The hot weekend weather probably caused some deterioration of the soybean crop, analysts said. And the forecasts for similar weather this week likely means yields will fall further, making contracts for future deliveries of soybeans more precious, <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON> said. Corn and oat futures soared their 10-cents-a-bushel daily limit. Soybeans were limited to moves of 30 cents a bushel, expect for the limitless August contract, which finished with a gain of more than 38 cents. Wheat settled 9 cents to 14 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.92 a bushel; corn was 7 -RCB- cents to 10 cents higher with September at $ 2.97 \ a bushel; oats were 7 -LCB- cents to 10 cents higher with September at $ 2.87 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 27 -LCB- cents to 38 -LCB- cents higher with August at $ 8.87 a bushel Livestock and meat futures finished mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly seven-state cattle-on-feed report. The government reported cattle marketings during July were 4 percent higher than the same month a year ago, which surprised most analysts and prompted predictions of a sharply higher opening Tuesday. The number of cattle on feed Aug. 1 in the seven largest cattle-producing states was 2 percent larger than a year ago, while 2 percent fewer cattle were placed on feedlots in those states during July. The high marketing number startled analysts, most of whom had expected a decline. The number meant there had been fewer drought-related sales of cattle to packing houses than analysts had believed, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Live cattle closed .07 cent to .45 cent higher with August at 69.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to 1.15 cents higher with August at 81.75 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .57 cent higher with August at 47.37 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .52 cent lower to .70 cent higher with August at 33.65 cents a pound. Precious metals futures posted modest gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in response to the inflationary implications of higher prices for most other commodities, said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled $ 1.70 to $ 2 higher with August at $ 433 a troy ounce; silver was 4.5 cents to 4.6 cents higher with September at $ 6.785 a troy ounce Energy futures prices rose on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in thin dealings in the absence of major fresh news to drive the market. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 14 cents higher with September at $ 15.61 a barrel; heating oil was .23 cent to .41 cent higher with September at 44.27 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .39 cent to .75 cent higher with September at 46.37 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures slumped on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid fears of rising interest rates, analysts said. The contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 3.45 points lower at 259.10.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed Ahead of Trade Figures; Gold Rises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar finished mixed Monday in mostly light trading, as some dealers sold the currency in anticipation of Tuesday's report on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for June. Gold prices rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid price for gold of $ 432.35 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 431 late Friday. The dollar started the trading day by falling in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, then recovering from its early lows to finish little changed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The dollar retreated anew against several key currencies in later <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading. Analysts attributed that decline mainly to dollar sales by traders balancing their dollar-heavy positions ahead of the latest of the monthly trade reports, which tend to strongly influence the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's movements. A negative trade performance usually sends the dollar lower, and vice versa. `` We had some slight lightening of long dollar positions,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, a vice president of corporate trading at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Traders are reluctant to hold big dollar positions because of the possibility of a surprise in the June figures. Many traders and economists are expecting a shortfall of between $ 10 billion and $ 12 billion. The trade deficit was $ 10.9 billion in May. Dealers said the dollar was supported, on the other hand, by the continuing impact of last week's unexpected hike to 6.5 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s discount rate, the interest it charges on loans to member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial institutions. Rising <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates make dollars more valuable. The dollar was scarcely affected by the news Monday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial production shot up 0.8 percent in July, the biggest increase in nine months, market watchers said. `` All the traders are waiting for the next direction in the dollar'' from the trade figures, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, a dealer for <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar traded at 132.95 Japanese yen, down 0.10 yen from Friday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 133.15 yen. By the end of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, the dollar was at 133.32 yen, up slightly from 133.28 yen late Friday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.7145 to buy one British pound, cheaper than $ 1.7155 late Friday. Later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound remained steady at $ 1.7145, more expensive than $ 1.7130 late Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.8805 West German marks, down from 1.8833; 1.5790 Swiss francs, up from 1.5777; 6.3760 French francs, down from 6.3965; 1,394.75 Italian lire, down from 1,397.50; and 1.2270 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2111 Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday: 1.8810 West German marks, up from 1.8805; 1.5780 Swiss francs, up from 1.5750; 6.3780 French francs, down from 6.3810; 2.1257 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1146; 1,398.00 Italian lire, up from 1,395.50; and 1.2196 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2195. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 430.40 a troy ounce, compared with late Friday's bid of $ 431.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, gold fell to a bid $ 431.00 an ounce, compared with Friday's $ 432.50.

<TEXT>
 The Farm Credit System on Monday reported a profit for the second quarter, continuing an improvement trend based on a reduction in its provision for loan losses. The system said it had combined net income of $ 170 million for the quarter, compared with a net loss of $ 46 million a year ago. Also contributing to the positive results were increased net interest income and a gain on the sales of certain properties. The system's net interest income totaled $ 214 million, compared with $ 110 million in the year-ago period. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fass </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the financing arm of the farm credit system, said improvements in net interest income resulted from increased reinstatements of nonaccrual loans to accrual status and from a modest decrease in the system's overall cost of debt. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status they are accounted for only as they come in rather than when they are due. During the second quarter, the system reported negative provisions for loan losses of $ 181 million, compared with a negative provision of $ 10 million a year earlier. `` In spite of the current drought, the recent improvements in the agricultural economy continued throughout the second quarter, resulting in stabilized loan collateral values and other improvements in the overall credit quality of the system's loan portfolio,'' <PERSON> Fass </PERSON> said. He noted that while it is too early to assess the impact of the current drought on system institutions, the system `` has been monitoring the drought very closely because of its potential impact on borrowers in certain parts of the country.'' For the first six months, the system reported net income of $ 336 million compared with a loss of $ 201 million a year ago. Net interest income during the period totaled $ 360 million, up from $ 258 million a year ago. During the second half, the system reported negative provisions for loan losses of $ 341 million, compared with a provision of $ 105 million a year earlier. The Farm Credit System consists of 37 borrower-owned banks and associations serving the rural economy. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> put it on a more secure footing last year by authorizing the issuance of up to $ 4 billion in government-backed, low-interest loans. The 1987 legislation, by increasing confidence in the Farm Credit System, made it possible to narrow the interest-rate spreads on Farm Credit debt obligations over <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Some Allegations in Suits Against Media General</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Monday dismissed lawsuit allegations that top <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials had an obligation to consider an unsolicited merger offer from investor <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> refused to throw out suit allegations that Media General made misleading statements in a recent proxy fight and that its board of directors may have acted improperly in creating a two-tiered stock structure that makes takeovers impossible without the consent of top management. The allegations were contained in two lawsuits filed by stockholders against the Richmond-based media company after <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> made a $ 1.8 billion buyout offer for the company's Class A stock in late February. Media General repeatedly rebuffed the overtures by <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, who staged an unsuccessful proxy fight for three seats on the board of directors in May. Media General Chairman <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and his family own 71 percent of the company's Class B shares, which control the election of the other six board members. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> has said the family's interest is not for sale <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> failed in a lawsuit to get a ruling allowing a combined Class A and B shareholders' majority vote on the takeover offer, and was critical of the company's two-tier stock structure. On Monday, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the plaintiffs in the shareholder suits that they should be prepared to show him at a Sept. 8 pre-trial meeting that their cases should go to a jury. `` For some time now the court has suspected that both were filed with the thought in mind that if <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> was successful on his claims, the other shareholders might reap a corresponding windfall,'' the judge said. Stockholders <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> filed one of the suits, contending they paid too much for their <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> stock because the price was inflated by incomplete or misleading statements by some of the company's top officers. Ms. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> also claimed the <ORGANIZATION> Bryans </ORGANIZATION> had a fiduciary duty to investigate and consider <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s merger plan and a later restructuring proposal. But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> noted the <ORGANIZATION> Bryans </ORGANIZATION> also are the principal stockholders, in addition to being directors. `` Once the <ORGANIZATION> Bryans </ORGANIZATION> as controlling shareholders had firmly rejected <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s offer, the board of directors had practically no role to play with respect'' to the <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> offer, the judge said. The <ORGANIZATION> Bryans </ORGANIZATION>' duty as directors `` does not obliterate their right, as shareholders, to sell or not to sell their stock as they choose,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The second suit was filed by <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, who said the <ORGANIZATION> Bryans </ORGANIZATION>, as principal shareholders, had a duty to other shareholders. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> dimissed that part of <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>'s suit, saying <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law made no such requirement.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Firm in Real Estate Deals Worth $155 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Troubled Beverly Enterprises, the nation's biggest nursing-home company, announced Monday it had arranged real estate transactions to raise $ 155 million to cover an anticipated debt. The company said it would mortgage 75 nursing homes to raise $ 120 million in cash and raise an additional $ 35 million by selling and then leasing back 27 additional facilities. Neither transaction will affect patients or staff at any of the nursing homes or congregate living centers involved, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, suffering under heavy debt and slow reimbursements, said it would use the cash to repay $ 148 million worth of liquid yield option notes due Sept. 30. The notes, similar to zero-coupon bonds, are publicly traded. The company has arranged with a lender to take out mortgages on 75 nursing homes in 17 states that either are owned outright or carry small mortgages, said <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. He refused to reveal the identity of the lender for the pool of mortgages. The sale-leaseback deal calls for purchase of 26 nursing homes and one congregate living center in seven states to <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> real estate investment trust. <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> announced it had agreed to pay $ 62 million for the facilities.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some 1,700 hospital service workers at seven hospitals overwhelmingly approved a two-year contract Monday while more than 2,000 striking nurses from six of the same hospitals returned to the bargaining table. Despite ratification, the agreement calls for members of Local 250 of the <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> to remain off the job until the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> ratifies an accord. But union leaders this weekend indicated it was not certain they would enforce that provision if the nurses' dispute continues for more than a few days. The service workers' union reported 92 percent of its members voted for ratification of a contract, which was reached in a 60-hour negotiating session under the auspices of Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> and a federal mediator. The union said it struck a compromise over sick time and vacation days, and eliminated plans by the hospitals to require workers to pay a share of the basic health insurance plan. It also said the two-year agreement restored fringe benefits for both full-time and part-time workers. On wages, the licensed vocational nurses will get a 3 percent increase over two years, going from $ 12.05 an hour to $ 12.40 an hour. The technical classes will get $ 12.25 by the end of the contract. Employees at the lower end of a two-tier wage system will get 3 percent increases in each of the two years. Service and maintenance workers, who account for 45 percent of union membership, will get no raise, but lump-sum bonuses of up to $ 300 by the end of the pact. It was the first strike for Local 250 in 50 years. Talks between the Affiliated Hospitals management group and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> were renewed Sunday, also assisted by <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> and the mediator. The service workers accord raised hopes for a quick end to the labor problems that have hobbled eight hospitals for nearly a month. The major issues in the nurses strike, which started Aug. 2, include demands for big salary increases, overtime pay for weekend work and staffing improvements. The nurses object to a management demand for the right to impose 12-hour workdays. Local 250's members include vocational nurses, surgical and psychiatric technicians, dietary workers, janitors and housekeeping employees. Pay currently ranges from $ 7.90 an hour for lower-tier housekeeping, laundry and and food service workers and hospital aides to $ 11.90 hourly for technicians and licensed vocational nurses. Within a day of the tentative agreement, talks with the registered nurses began, but <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, cautioned against hopes for an immediate settlement. The average salary for a nurse working for one of the Affiliated Hospitals ranges between $ 30,072 and $ 37,692 for day shifts, and $ 34,583 to $ 43,346 for night shift nurses. Hospitals hit by the strike have employed nurses from around the country as replacements. The replacements are being recruited with promises of hourly wages ranging between $ 20 and $ 25 an hour, plus free air fare and accommodations while in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CNA </ORGANIZATION> said the high cost of hiring replacements was applying great pressure on the hospitals to settle quickly. The Affiliated Hospitals group represents Children's, <PERSON> Marshal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zion </LOCATION>, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Seton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Daly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Nurses also are on strike at <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where talks are being held separately. The service workers union are on strike at the same hospitals, plus <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where the registered nurses are not unionized.

<HEAD>Takeover Defense Keys on GAF's Legal Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a unique move aimed at fending off a possible hostile takeover by <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been indicted on charges of stock manipulation, <ORGANIZATION> Cabot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has adopted a defense designed to repel attacks by companies facing government investigation. Wayne-based <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 1 for antitrust clearance to raise its 4.9 percent stake in <LOCATION> Cabot </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Waltham </LOCATION>, Mass.-based energy and chemicals company, to as much as 25 percent. <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> responded by amending its anti-takeover defense so it would be triggered if at least 15 percent of a company's common stock was held by a person targeted for government investigation or action. Once the `` poison pill'' was triggered, <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> stockholders could buy more shares at half the market price, making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> indicted <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> and its vice-chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> in July on charges they manipulated the price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> common stock after an unsuccessful attempt to take over the larger company in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> both pleaded innocent to the charges in the indictment, which marked the first criminal charges against a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial enterprise stemming indirectly from revelations of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the Wall Street felon at the center of the widespread insider trading scandal. The indictment charged that <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> attempted to create an artificial demand for Carbide stock after <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover attempt failed, allegedly to allow <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> to sell its 10 percent stake at a better profit or a minimal loss. <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>'s takeover defense, which was designed by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm <LOCATION> Skadden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arps </LOCATION>, Slate, <ORGANIZATION> Meagher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flom </ORGANIZATION>, is considered possibly the first attempt to capitalize on Wall Street's insider trading scandal. The idea could signal a trend, as several other major takeover players are under investigation in the scandal. It was not clear whether <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> actually intended to mount a takeover bid for <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>, however. Telephone calls to the company seeking comment on Monday night were not answered. <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> has been considered by some analysts as a candidate for takeover or restructuring aimed at boosting its stock price. Cabot shares rose $ 3 to $ 37 a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. With some 27 million common shares outstanding, <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> had a market value of about $ 999 million based on Monday's closing price. A <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> spokesman told the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> over the weekend that `` we have no comment whatsoever with regard to <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>'s mean-spirited response to our company's filing. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> first disclosed its stake in <LOCATION> Cabot </LOCATION> in 1986, according to a company spokesman.
