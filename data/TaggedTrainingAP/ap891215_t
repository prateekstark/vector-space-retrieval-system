<HEAD>Vietnam Protests Forced Repatriation of Boat People</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> told <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that it rejects the forced repatriation of refugees from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and reserved the right to send them back to the British colony, official Vietnamese media reported Friday. A Foreign Ministry official handed a note on the issue to <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> <PERSON> Emrys </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, said a <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> report in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. A group of 51 Vietnamese were flown from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on Tuesday in the first repatriation of boat people against their will. However, Vietnamese authorities accepted the group back and the official media said without clear explanation that the repatriation was `` part of the framework'' of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s policy of rejecting forced repatriation. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> note strongly affirmed the policy of rejecting forced repatriation and `` and only accepting those who volunteer to return or who are not opposed to the repatriation.'' It said the ministry official cautioned <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> that `` any violation of these principles may hamper and even completely disrupt the process of cooperation to resolve this problem step by step'' as agreed to at the multilateral conference on Indochinese refugees held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in June. The agency said the ministry official stressed that `` if <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> discovers any case of ` forced repatriation,' it reserves the right to return them to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>.'' Many of the 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed into <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> since June 1988 are considered illegal `` economic migrants'' unless they can prove they fled their Communist homeland fearing persecution. Thousands have held demonstrations to protest the decision by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> its colony to force the return of the refugees, a decision condemned by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Scientists excavating an ancient lake shore in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> say a concentration of fossils there dates from a time when the area was a lush tropical forest and creatures resembling armored monsters roamed the Earth. <PERSON> Hans-Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sues </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> paleobiologist, said Thursday that the rich collection of fossil remains are from a variety of animals that lived 225 million years ago and some are of a type never before found. `` Many of these are not known because rocks from this particular chunk of time are not found anywhere else in the world,'' said Sues in an interview. `` This is the first time that we've got a really diverse group of land animals from this part of geologic time.'' Sues said the largest assembled fossil includes the body, but not the head, of a five-foot-long reptile resembling an armor-plated crocodile. `` This creature had two rows on its back of this very massive bony plate and huge spines sticking out on the side,'' said Sues. `` It's like something from a Japanese monster movie. It is a funny-looking creature and an entirely new type of animal.'' Sues said the Triassic period fossils were found in a formation of stone called mudrock about 15 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. The assemblage includes many fossils from a group of animals called cynodonts, the closest reptile ancestors of the mammal. Sues said the fossils include parts for a cynodont about the size of a small dog, and other parts from a mammal-like reptile measuring 5 to 10 inches long. Sues said fragments of fossils of this type have been found in the northern hemisphere, but never in such a large group. Individual cynodont fossils also have been found in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` This is further evidence for the super continent of <LOCATION> Pangaea </LOCATION>, when all of the continents were one large giant land mass,'' he said, because fossils from the same species and the same era can be found on continents that now are separated. It is thought that during the geologic period called Triassic, between 240 to 205 million years ago, all of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s land area was connected in one large mass called <LOCATION> Pangaea </LOCATION>. The land mass slowly split apart, as massive plates drifted away from each other over millions of years, and the continents and islands eventually arranged themselves in their present positions. Sues said that when the cynodonts and other creatures lived in what is now <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the area was near the equator and the climate was tropical and humid, with lush vegetation. `` You had these huge fresh water lakes and rivers throughout the whole area,'' he said. `` You had an incredible variety of animals. There were plant eaters and a whole variety of meat eaters.'' Sues said the cynodont fossils found in the assemblage include five very small jaw bones, apparently from hatchlings, six larger jaw bones, and the back bone and head from a still-larger animal. `` The cynodonts were creatures that were the precursors for true mammals,'' he said. `` They are not mammals themselves, but were species that gave rise to mammals.'' One of the small jaw fossils is attached to a detailed mold of the brain, and <PERSON> Sues </PERSON> said this may enable scientists to learn more about how the mammalian brain developed. Most of the Triassic period reptiles died out as dinosaurs began to evolve into the dominant animal, around the time the first mammal is thought to have evolved. `` This find gives further evidence that mammals and dinosaurs probably evolved at the same time,'' Sues said. `` The dinosaur became very successful and remained successful for the next 140 million years and mammals were sort of pushed over the side and only became important and successful after the dinosaurs went extinct.'' Dinosaurs became extinct, for reasons still not understood, about 65 million years ago, and mammals, such as mankind, evolved into the dominant animal. The fossil deposit was found by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, a geologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lamont-Doherty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> was conducting a survey in the area in 1985, Sues said, and chanced onto a small fossil. Sues identified it as a cynodont part and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> supported further exploration leading to the discovery of the large fossil deposit.

 Three members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> want to know if the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> are making good on a promise to stop testing only men when seeking cures to diseases that also affect women. Reps. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., on Thursday asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to investigate a policy adopted in 1987 after a report from the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> showed sex discrimination at <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> clinical `` The gender bias in medical research is n't confined to the lab; it filters down to the health care that women receive,'' said <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>. `` If a woman wants to know if she should take an aspirin every other day to help prevent heart disease or take a cholesterol-lowering drug to bring down her cholesterol level, her doctor wo n't have the answer. All of the research in this area has been done on men,'' said the congresswoman. She was referring to two studies that were highly criticized for excluding women _ the <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Risk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intervention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trials </ORGANIZATION>, which studied coronary disease risk factors, and the Physician's Health Study, which inspected use of aspirin as preventive therapy for coronary disease Both studies were started before 1987. <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> said she feared the treatments developed from these men-only studies might be useless or even harmful when applied to women. `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> are aware of this problem, but we want to know what success they've had in including more women in medical research,'' said <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>. `` After all, you do n't test apples to see what happens to oranges. The institutes, which together have a $ 7.68 billion budget, are funding hundreds of studies on their <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, campus and through grants to universities and private companies throughout the country. They comprise the nation's largest medical research agency. Dr. <PERSON> Millicent </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who helps decide who will do research for the National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>, said observational studies were including women all along. The problem was in experimentation. `` The studies started recently include women,'' she said. But she said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> audit will determine the degree to which women are involved in clinical testing. The policy established by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 did not have any target date or quotas for increasing women in clinical tests. A research official in another institute at <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> said she did n't think women were being excluded intentionally `` It was like everything else in our society,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazeltine </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> within the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. `` Women are second-class citizens so they are thought of second.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> said that because men dominate medical research they often study problems related to themselves. `` We've heard this for several years,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the people making the decisions are getting the message.'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said they want the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report by April, before <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and the environment begins authorization hearings of the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> budget for the next fiscal year. Among the questions asked by the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are: _ Has <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> refused to issue any grants because the applications did not comply with the policy to include women _ Have any grants been given waivers _ What is the cost of including women in clinical tests What are the cost implications of continuing to exclude them? _ What are the gender, race, ethnic origin and age of the people used in clinical trials Which studies used predominantly one gender, race, ethnic group or age group?

<HEAD>Marcos Knew of Conspiracy That Led to Murders, Lawyer Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had `` full knowledge'' of an intelligence conspiracy that led to the 1981 murders of two anti-Marcos activists in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, a lawyer told jurors Thursday. But a defense attorney said that although it's easy to see the late <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> dictator as `` the personification of excess and evil,'' no evidence indicates the deaths of Silme Domingo and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON> were caused by anything other than a local union dispute. The lawyers' comments came during closing arguments in a civil lawsuit accusing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his widow, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, and others of running an intelligence network that harassed and intimidated anti-Marcos elements in this country. Plaintiffs claim defendant Dr. <PERSON> Leonilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> ran an intelligence slush fund for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> that paid for the murders, and that the payoff was delivered to the killers by defendant <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Baruso </PERSON>, who was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON>, who were reformist officers of the union, were shot in its offices on June 1, 1981. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' intelligence network `` ran amok'' and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> did nothing to stop it, plaintiffs' attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Withey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> `` had full knowledge of the conspiracy and not only foresaw but condoned acts of harassment and physical violence'' against his opponents in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Withey </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> jury that is hearing the case against the <ORGANIZATION> Marcoses </ORGANIZATION>. Judge <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> will judge the liability of five other defendants in the lawsuit, which seeks millions of dollars in damages for the victims' survivors. <PERSON> Withey </PERSON> said the murders were `` made to look like a union dispute _ hot-headed Filipinos shooting it out, vicious thuggery.'' But evidence clearly showed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> headed an extensive intelligence network not only in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> but in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. `` We're talking about so many spy agencies you ca n't even count them all,'' <PERSON> Withey </PERSON> said. At the start of the trial Thanksgiving week, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> defense lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> had painted <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON> as small fry in the anti-Marcos movement, laboring in `` a smaller vineyard'' than more prominent activists. But <PERSON> Withey </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON> had traveled to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to meet with `` the largest and most threatening labor organization <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had ever encountered,'' and that both men had sponsored a resolution critical of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> labor convention. `` Mr. <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> may have thought the vineyard was small, but <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> knew better,'' <PERSON> Withey </PERSON> said. Three men linked to a Filipino gang were convicted of murder on the theory that <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON> were victims of an internal union dispute over work assignments and gambling in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> fish canneries. `` There was turmoil in this union. There were bribes, there was violence, there were gangs, there was murder,'' <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said. `` Sure, it's easy to look upon <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> as the personification of excess and evil. That's what the case panders to,'' he said. `` Do n't be so blinded by it to seize on the target of two incredibly unpopular people and hold them accountable for that which is not theirs to account.'' But <PERSON> Withey </PERSON> said evidence did n't support that explanation. `` The evidence establishes that <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON> were far more than anti-Marcos activists who happened to be killed in an unrelated dispute,'' he said. `` They were very active and effective anti-Marcos activists.'' The jurors must decide whether the Marcoses were part of a conspiracy that led to the murders and whether they were negligent in exercising control over their intelligence network. <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> on Thursday granted a motion by the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> government to be dismissed from the suit. In a videotaped deposition made before his death last September, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was overthrown in February 1986, took the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when asked about his connections with <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON>.

<HEAD>USDA Predicts 1990 Will be a Better Year for Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A survey of bankers shows them to be in basic agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> experts that 1990 will be a brighter year for farmers and the rural economy. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projects some improvement in net cash income of farmers, perhaps to around $ 54 billion or so, compared with an estimated $ 53 billion this year. Net cash income is the money farmers have left over from gross cash earnings after paying cash expenses. Department economists also predict 1990 increases in farmland prices, farm assets and equity values, which are important indicators of financial condition. `` Overall, the financial condition of farmers is stronger now than at any other time in the last several years,'' says the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is largely due to cautious investment behavior, effective cost control, increased cash financing, and continued restructuring and write-offs of outstanding debt.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said its survey of 60 bankers at the group's annual conference last month in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, indicated optimism for the rural economy in 1990. Sixty percent said they were optimistic about the outlook for the rural economy. Eight percent said it would worsen. In general, the bankers said they believe farmers next year `` will plant more acreage, use fewer chemicals, sell more products to foreign markets, sign up for more crop insurance and increase their use of computers'' for their records. About 48 percent of the bankers responding to the survey said competition from other banks and the Farm Credit System would be the biggest issue for them in 1990. Rural development was second with 28 percent. The bankers were not so optimistic about the use of the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s guaranteed loan program. Half said they expect to make fewer FmHA-guaranteed loans next year, while 25 percent said they expected an increase and 25 percent no change. `` The results apparently reflect the bankers' concerns over what they consider to be the burdensome paperwork involved in the program,'' the association said. But when it comes to ending federal subsidies to farmers, 67 percent of the bankers said they were opposed to scrapping the payments. `` Nearly all of the bankers surveyed -LRB- 95 percent -RRB- said, so far, they have not had to pay for cleanup costs on environmentally contaminated collateral or property,'' the association reported. `` Likewise, a majority -LRB- 93 percent -RRB- of the bankers said animal rights laws have not affected whether they would make a loan.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> calls itself `` the national trade and professional association for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s commercial banks of all sizes. Assets of <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> member banks are about 95 percent of the industry total.''

 The Republic of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> has produced its first litter of test-tube pigs, a step the island nation hopes will lead to a supply of genetically superior swine for <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s trade officer in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> said the potential market for such breeder pigs is estimated at 1.8 million sows, or $ 270 million, in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> alone. `` Companies in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have expressed a keen interest in using <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> as an agrotechnology service base,'' the report said. <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> is eliminating traditional methods of pork production, which require extensive land use and create pollution. `` The birth of the piglets marks the beginning of efforts to modernize production and to create a stock of elite, genetically superior breeding pigs, which can be built up for mass production throughout the region,'' the report said. Veterinary surgeons implanted a surrogate sow with donated embryos last spring, resulting in the birth of seven offspring in September. The report said the surrogate mother can be adapted to local conditions, allowing her to pass on antibodies to local diseases to her young. Because the risk of disease is reduced, the chance of survival is increased. Also, the cost of transporting embryos is less expensive than live animals, and disease transmission is minimized.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bought <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> poultry meat this year for the first time in a decade, but <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts say the future potential of the Soviet market is uncertain.

 House Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> is appealing to his past campaign contributors to help pay more than $ 125,000 in legal fees for preparing his defense against ethics charges. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Galen </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> congressman, said Thursday that <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> sent an urgent fundraising letter last week to some 12,000 previous contributors seeking help with his legal bills. Two <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorneys, former <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethune </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swillinger </PERSON>, have been preparing a defense so <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> will be ready if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee decides to launch a formal investigation of two complaints filed against him by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Galen </PERSON> said `` It's like buying insurance,'' the spokesman said. `` You hope you do n't have to use it.'' The ethics committee has taken no formal action on either complaint. The first alleges that <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules and federal campaign finance laws by getting 21 investors to put up $ 5,000 each to promote his 1984 book, `` Window of Opportunity.'' An outside counsel hired to evaluate that complaint concluded in October that there were not sufficient grounds for the panel to investigate <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who was elected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> whip after filing the ethics complaint that led to the resignation last June of former Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. After the outside counsel made its recommendation, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> filed another complaint, along with 670 pages of supporting documents, accusing <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of ethics and campaign finance violations in seven new areas. <PERSON> Galen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> sent out the fundraising appeal because he does not have enough money in his campaign account to pay the attorneys' bills. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> reported to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on June 30 that he had $ 35,847 in leftover debts from his 1988 re-election campaign and a cash balance in his 1990 campaign account of $ 50,297.

 A veterans group is suing country singer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> for refusing to perform at a concert when the group refused to pay in cash upfront. The federal suit, filed Wednesday by the Veterans of the Vietnam War, says <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> was hired in April to perform at a concert in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, on Aug. 18. He received an $ 11,250 check and was to get the balance on the day of the concert. On that day, <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> allegedly demanded the balance in cash, despite the contract's provision for payment by check, and refused to perform. The suit claims he also failed to provide sound and lighting equipment, preventing other bands from performing. The veterans group lost about $ 228,000 as a result of his actions, the suit claims. <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> disputed the allegations Thursday, saying the group had promised him a 30-day promissory note, not a check.

<HEAD>Job Market Survey Shows Good Growth for College Grads Next Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 College graduates in 1990 can look forward to a job market much like 1989's _ a year of good growth _ with engineering students pulling in the highest starting salaries, according to an annual survey released Thursday. But the author of the survey said the 260 businesses surveyed were more cautious in their economic outlook than they were a year ago, with 44 percent saying they expected business to be about the same and 6 percent predicting a decline. Fifty percent said they expected a slightly better business climate in 1990. `` This is a rather unusual balance _ a decidedly mixed outlook,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON>, author of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Lindquist-Endicott Report of 1990. `` Although there appears to be economic stability with limited growth, there is vulnerability in the marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON>, associate dean and director of placement at the school. `` If a decline in business becomes pronounced and widespread, there will be an immediate and sudden drop in job opportunities for college graduates.'' The 44th annual Lindquist-Endicott report surveyed medium to large businesses and industrial companies. Among those surveyed were major employers in banking, finance, merchandising, electronics and public utilities. <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> said there is `` a rather good match'' this year between the number of students entering the job market and the jobs available. But he predicted by 1992 there will be more jobs than students, because of a declining pool of students. He said that on average, starting salaries for this spring's graduates would be up 3.9 percent over last spring, lagging slightly behind inflation But he noted a new trend in which 24 percent of businesses offered signing bonuses of about $ 3,000 on average to students who actually accept jobs. Students with engineering degrees can expect to earn an average $ 32,304 starting salary, the highest among their peers, the report said. Those majoring in computer sciences and chemistry are not far behind, with average starting salaries of $ 29,100 and $ 29,088, respectively. <PERSON> Linquist </PERSON> said the outlook should continue to be strong for computer science majors. Accounting majors got the biggest percentage salary increase, up 5.8 percent over last year's figure to an average of $ 27,408, while starting salaries in sales-marketing showed the smallest increase, up .2 percent to $ 27,828. <PERSON> Lindquist </PERSON> said companies are spending more money recruiting at colleges and universities and noted `` a little bit of craziness'' in which some companies hold college receptions complete with `` caviar, shrimp and exotic pates.'' But he said companies continue to seek the old standbys: good grades and extra-curricular activities.

<HEAD>PECO Fined for Improperly Cutting Off Electricity to Customers</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Thursday fined <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> $ 50,000 for improperly cutting off electricity to customers, including a family who resorted to using candles that started a fatal fire. The <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION> said the utility also must contribute $ 400,000 to an energy assistance fund for needy families as part of a settlement regarding customer service violations over a two-year period. The most publicized case was last April, when <ORGANIZATION> PECO </ORGANIZATION> cut off electricity to a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> family who used candles to light their home. Eleven days later, a fire started in their row home in the city's <LOCATION> Fairmount </LOCATION> section and killed seven-year-old <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>. His five-year-old brother <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> received third-degree burns over 35 percent of his body. An <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION> investigation determined <ORGANIZATION> PECO </ORGANIZATION> did not alert a `` responsible adult'' in the family that service would be terminated but instead told a neighbor. The commission said the utility also did not provide a 48-hour termination notice and would not agree to payment plan offered twice by the family to clear up the delinquent bill. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer research, said the <ORGANIZATION> Blackwells </ORGANIZATION> owed $ 738.01. <ORGANIZATION> PECO </ORGANIZATION> terminated service and wanted $ 338 to reconnect the electricity and asked the family to pay $ 20 a month afterwards. The <ORGANIZATION> Blackwells </ORGANIZATION> received state assistance and could not afford the amount, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> PECO </ORGANIZATION> would not accept any other payment arrangements. `` They treated this family like they were <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>,'' Commissioner <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. `` They did n't take into consideration, as required by law, -LRB- the <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>'s -RRB- ability to pay.'' After reading the <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION>'s report, <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> said he concluded `` <ORGANIZATION> PECO </ORGANIZATION>'s violations of regulations directly and significantly contributed to the death of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> and the maiming of <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> said he believes the utility's violations and sloppy administration contributed to the fatal fire He said <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> had been fined $ 50,000 for similar violations in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> PECO </ORGANIZATION> was also forced to pay $ 150,000 to an energy assistance fund. <ORGANIZATION> PECO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said the fatal fire can not be linked to the company's termination of service. <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> said it is `` quite disturbing'' that <ORGANIZATION> PECO </ORGANIZATION> did not modify its behavior after the 1987 fines. `` I think a $ 400,000 fine has good possibilities for behavior modification,'' <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> said, noting that the greatest driving force for change `` is the death.'' `` Without question, if you look at the report of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in this case, the company has made substantial progress from where it was two years ago,'' <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Rural America Has Low-Income Housing Crisis, Report Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly three of every four rural households pay more for housing than the government considers affordable, with about a quarter of all rural residents living in substandard dwellings, says a new report. `` To many Americans, the low-income housing crisis is primarily an urban problem, calling up visions of homeless men and women sleeping on steam grates and of families in city welfare hotels,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. `` Yet in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, too, there is a crisis in housing for low-income people,'' <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said. His organization and the <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> coauthored the report released Thursday. Sen. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, said the report demonstrates the need for his rural housing legislation. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> has introduced a bill that would increase funding for <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rural housing programs by $ 500 million over two years, targeting rural communities that traditionally do not get much help from the federal government. `` In my home state of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, 12 rural counties have poverty rates over 20 percent and occupied substandard housing rates over 10 percent,'' said <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>. `` Some 100,000 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> households still use outhouses.'' The report found that 42 percent of rural poor households spent at least half of their income on housing in 1985, the most recent year for which data is available. It said 26 percent spent 70 percent or more for housing. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> has standards that say housing is not considered affordable unless it is 30 percent or less of a family's income. While an earlier <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> study showed it's more expensive to live in urban areas, the study released by the two organizations Thursday says more rural residents live in substandard housing than city dwellers According to the report, the worst rural housing is in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The study showed that 83 percent of all rural housing units with rats were in the South, as were 79 percent of the homes with inadequate waste disposal, 73 percent with holes in the floor, 61 percent with inadequate heating, 53 percent with cracks in the walls and 52 percent with inadequate water supplies. The study was based on data released in February 1989 by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in a study called the American Housing Survey of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1985. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities is an independent research organization that specializes in issues affecting low - and moderate-income groups The Housing Assistance Council promotes development of low-income rural housing through seed-money loans, technical assistance, research and information.

 Opposition leader-playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> has gained more support for the presidency, with 40,000 supporters cheering him in the streets and the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> primate joining his chorus of backers The opposition and Communist leaders planned to resume negotiations toward selecting the new president. Communist hard-liner <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> resigned Sunday after swearing in the first government here since 1948 not dominated by Communists. Opposition spokesman <PERSON> Lubos </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrovsky </PERSON> told a news conference Thursday night that negotiations would resume soon but did not say when. He said negotiators were exhausted after intense discussions that lasted until late Wednesday and decided to take Thursday night off. About 40,000 people poured into <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on Thursday to show their support for <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>. The rally was called by students who were the vanguard of the pro-democracy movement. Police action on Nov. 17 against peaceful student demonstrators left 143 injured and launched the peaceful revolution that forced the Communists to relinquish their monopoly on power. `` Havel for president!'' and `` We want <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>!'' chanted the crowd Thursday. The voice of Czechoslovak Primate Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> on Thursday joined others supporting <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, according to the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>. `` My choice for the function of the country's president is Mr. <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, fighter for the right, justice and truth, not only for himself, but for all of us,'' wrote the popular, 91-year-old cardinal in a statement of support carried by <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>. The talks Wednesday night at first seemed to have produced agreement in how a new president would be named. Under the constitution, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has two weeks after the resignation to elect a new head of state and avoid a constitutional crisis. Opposition leaders thought they reached an understanding with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in earlier negotiations that <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> would be named president until free elections next year. But the 350-member, Communist-dominated parliament has resisted electing the former dissident, who spent years in jail for fighting Communist rule and defending human rights. In parliamentary sessions Tuesday and Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> deputies introduced a proposal to hold a referendum to choose the new head of state. Negotiators met until late Wednesday and concluded by issuing a joint statement saying the deadline would be extended by a constitutional amendment to give <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> 45 days to select the president. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hora </PERSON> said the party would make its decision on the issue at a special congress set for Dec. 20-21. The party's shifts indicated a split in party ranks between reform-minded members and those associated with the old, discredited regime of hard-liners. Also suggesting divisions within <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> ranks was the announcement that Slovak party boss <PERSON> Ignac </PERSON> <PERSON> Janak </PERSON> stepped down Thursday from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanus </PERSON> resigned from the party secretariat.

<TEXT>
 The Pentagon has proposed halting round-the-clock flights of an airborne command post that since 1961 has had orders to take charge of nuclear forces if the president and other leaders were killed, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. According to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is instead proposing that the planes be changed to `` continuous ground alert with specified number of sorties per week.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> recommendation, made amid growing defense budgetary restraints and the belief the threat of a surprise <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear attack is diminishing, needs President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s authorization. One official told the Times the plan has not drawn strong objections from within the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, where some preliminary defense budget recommendations were reversed after debate. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> maintains on a rotating basis a fleet of planes collectively known as `` Looking Glass'' that has been under the command of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb. In the event <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders were killed during nuclear war, a SAC general would assume command of nuclear forces.

 Younger people with limited educations are more likely than anyone to light up and should be the target of campaigns against cigarettes, a study released by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> concluded. A 1988 survey of about 20,000 people in 36 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> found that less-educated people, who also tend to be of a lower social and economic status, are more likely to be smokers. `` There has been progress in reducing cigarette smoking. But the study shows most of the progress is limited to the well-educated,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON> of the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, who analyzed aspects of the survey released Thursday. `` The emphasis must become more targeted,'' he said. `` Some of that already is being done through substance abuse programs. Tobacco is an addictive substance.'' <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> has a program in inner-city schools working to reduce the odds of children becoming regular smokers, as do private institutes and some state health departments. The random telephone survey sought people 18 or older. Results showed that for people older than 35 the likelihood of being a current smoker increased with each decrease in the level of education. But for those ages 18 to 34, the chance of being a current smoker decreased substantially only for those with more than a high school education, while smoking rates for high school dropouts and those with high school diplomas were more nearly equal. The study said cultural factors, such as the high Mormon population in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, also may affect who smokes. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> had the lowest rate of smokers in its over-18 population -LRB- 18.1 percent -RRB- and former smokers -LRB- 9.1 percent -RRB-. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> had the highest percentage of current smokers -LRB- 37.9 percent -RRB-. The highest percentage of former smokers was in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> -LRB- 20.3 percent -RRB-. The median figure for current smokers was 26.2 percent, meaning half the states were above that figure and half below. The median figure for former smokers was 15.1 percent. The study said other factors affecting who smokes include smoking prevention activities such as school programs, state cigarette taxes and the intensity of promotional events and advertising by the tobacco industry. The study found that 41 percent of the 18-to-34 group with less than a high school education are smokers. The figure dropped to about 34 percent for those with a high school education and 19 percent to those with more than a high school education. In older age groups the education difference between smokers and non-smokers was much less pronounced. The survey is part of a continuing study done annually since 1980 with more states participating each year.

 The told listeners where the snipers were hiding, where the bombs were falling. They filled the airwaves with information, some of it frenetic, some of it wrong, all of it thrilling. `` I'm hit,'' screamed a woman reporter over the air when a shell landed nearby. She continued to broadcast as her van rushed her to the hospital, where doctors found she was suffering only from shock. Such was the wild, free-wheeling style of radio reporting here during the eight-day uprising launched by mutinous soldiers on Dec. 1 in an unsuccessful effort to topple President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Filipinos listened to the rebellion on the radio, absorbed by round-the-clock running coverage by what is the major medium for news and information here. `` We got threats from all kinds of people almost every day,'' said <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sison </PERSON>, managing editor of <ORGANIZATION> DZRH </ORGANIZATION> radio. `` We tried to balance our reporting, and the threats from both sides made us think we did have a balanced programming.'' Differences in reporting style showed the slant of individual stations. Reporters and anchormen for <ORGANIZATION> DZMM </ORGANIZATION> screamed at colleagues from rival stations for airing `` tactical information,'' such as positions of government forces and the types of firearms and vehicles used. `` You are traitors to our country,'' a reporter lectured on the air. As tension mounted, the government warned it would strictly enforce existing guidelines giving it authority to close stations that broadcast hostile propaganda or `` disinformation.'' Newspapers are exempt from such controls. Publishers say they received no directives from the government on what to print. Individual reporters claim, however, they have been lectured by military and civilian officials angry at stories perceived as favorable to the rebels. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> closed <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> DZEC </ORGANIZATION> after it erroneously reported that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> fled the palace at the height of the coup attempt. The station has been the chief outlet of supporters of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who died in <LOCATION> Hawaiian </LOCATION> exile this year after being ousted as president in February 1986. The commission also shut down <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> DYLA </ORGANIZATION> after it broadcast a taped interview of rebel leader Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abenina </PERSON>. A week later, the commission reopened the station at the request of church leaders. So far, the government has issued no formal warnings against other stations. It did not prevent the stations from interviewing rebels after they gave up strongholds in the <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> financial district on Dec. 7, despite the `` ban'' on rebel propaganda. But stations that adopted a more balanced editorial policy faced another problem _ fending off threats from both government officials and the rebels. <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> DZRH </ORGANIZATION> said the staff received frequent calls from <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> and military officials demanding that the station omit detailed reports of rebel attacks on military camps. Rebels also demanded that reporters covering the street fighting broadcast their propaganda. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON>, chief of the military-civil relations office, complained at one point that such detailed reporting was helping rebel soldiers correct their aim during air and artillery attacks at the armed forces headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo. Stations also received threats from mutineers who demanded that they transmit only rebel propaganda. One reporter, who spoke on condition that his name and station not be mentioned, said rebels threatened him after management refused to broadcast his interview with them. Television stations reacted more cautiously. All but one of the five <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> stations, including the government station, went off the air on the first day of the coup attempt. Technicians at the four stations removed essential transmitter parts to keep rebel soldiers from seizing their facilities and telecasting propaganda. In 1987, rebel forces loyal to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> took over private radio-television station GMA-7 and broadcast statements. GMA officials said they learned from that experience and decided to resume operations days later, when it looked like the conflict was over. As the coup attempt unfolded, stations exercised a degree of self-censorship by bowing to government demands that they avoid detailed reports of tactical operations. Several continued broadcasting reports of shelling at Camp Aguinaldo and elsewhere, for example, but would not state precisely where the rounds were falling. Government officers complained the rebels were monitoring the reports and adjusting their aim accordingly. Stations still reported movements of government forces but without detailing exactly how many troops were deployed. At least 113 people died in the coup, the most serious attempt yet to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 From national hero to shunned exile to popular lawmaker, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s remarkable journey of conscience made him perhaps the world's most celebrated dissident. His life was a great irony: the physicist who developed the Soviet hydrogen bomb went on to become his nation's greatest advocate of human rights at a time when the world lived under the shadow of nuclear war. He spoke out for democracy when many others were silent. He kept speaking out when it became fashionable under the reforms of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Hours before he died at age 68, he stood on the floor of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and demanded that the squabbling opposition form an alternative party to the ruling Communists. `` We can not take on ourselves responsibility for what the leadership is doing now,'' he said, speaking in an official forum the type of words that sent him into internal exile for six years, that won him a Nobel Peace Prize. Selfless, brave and determined, the stooped, disheveled dean of Soviet dissent lived to see many of his dreams come true. His own people began to acknowledge his greatness, as the rest of the world had done earlier. But <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was never satisfied, saluting reforms but faulting their inadequacy. He constantly challenged even the man who turned many of his dreams into reality and set him free after nearly seven years in exile. `` I personally respect <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeyevich </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> very much, but it is dangerous to give so much power even to the initiator of perestroika,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> boldly told the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in June after it added the presidency to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s job as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary. Born the son of a physicist on May 21, 1921, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s early fame was not as a political activist but as a brilliant scientist. He was inducted into the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in 1953 at age 32, the hallowed hall's youngest member ever. In 1948, he joined physicist <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamm </PERSON> in developing the hydrogen bomb and for the next 20 years lived and worked in secrecy, with privileges that included a good apartment, a driver, a high salary and a government awards. But, like <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> began to worry about the morality of developing weapons of mass destruction. He had his first major brush with top Soviet officials in 1961, when he appealed to Premier <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> to stop nuclear weapons tests. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> responded that scientists should n't meddle in politics. Two years later, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to such limits in a treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, horrified at Soviet society's mistreatment of its own citizens, once said his `` social and political views underwent a major evolution.'' He risked his prestigious position and began using his influence for victims of human rights abuses in 1966, speaking out for those who suffered under dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repressions The authorities showed their rage in 1968, when <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s `` Progress, Coexistence and Intellectual Freedom'' was published abroad It called for Soviet-American detente well before the concept became part of Soviet foreign policy, saying progress in disarmament is impossible without human rights and political changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He was banned from work on secret projects. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> called the essay `` a turning point in my life'' and two years later, he helped found the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. In 1971, after the death of his first wife, he married <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> doctor and human rights activist who was to become his constant, feisty companion. In 1975, he won even greater world recognition and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The Soviets, on the other hand, condemned his strong criticism of the 1979 Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. First they stripped him of his awards and then on Jan. 22, 1980, he was pickup up on a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> street and banished to internal exile in <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>, a closed city 200 miles east. In an autobiographical statement written in 1981, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> reflected on his approach to human rights. `` Moral criteria, in combination with unrestricted inquiry, provide the only possible compass for these complex and contradictory problems. ... Today, as always, I believe in the power of reason and the human spirit,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> wrote. Western governments, scientific and human rights groups pressed the Soviets to release him. In December 1986, a phone was suddenly installed in <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s Gorky apartment, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called to say he could return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, suppressing his joy at the news to show his concern for others, told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to free all political prisoners. Two months after <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s release, scores of political prisoners were freed and he threw his support behind <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He gradually was rehabilitated, getting his old job back at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, speaking at official conferences and giving interviews to the Soviet press. In November 1988, he was allowed to travel abroad for the first time, even though <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself had said earlier <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> could not travel to other countries because he had access to state secrets. Although he professed not to aspire to politics, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was elected to represent the Academy in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Academy leaders had initially rejected him, but had to reverse the decision after a popular outcry. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s rumpled figure and high-pitched voice became familiar to millions of Soviets watching his televised appearances at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and fellow parliamentarian <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> called him `` the nation's conscience.'' Age and poor health curtailed his human rights activities _ he looked far older than his years _ but when he felt he had to speak out, he did, such as his condemnation of the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in June 1989 and constant complaints that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic and political reforms did not go far enough. Even though he was a poor speaker _ with a slight stutter and high-pitched voice _ the public had come to know and like <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> so much that an unscientific poll by a Soviet newspaper in October 1989 indicated he was the most popular parliamentarian, outscoring even <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the maverick Communist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. In a February 1989 tribute to <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION> `` praised a person who had earlier been cursed'' and published his long-suppressed essays and letters. The Soviet press had come a long way from the pre-glasnost days when it branded him a traitor and `` utterly ignorant person'' who `` groveled before the capitalist order.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., made at least 40 expense-paid speaking appearances to earn $ 100,000 through a book contract he's accused of using to launder honoraria, records show His <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> publisher said Thursday the speaking fees enabled him to show a profit on <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>'s two books on health and defense policy and allowed the senator to record the earnings as salary. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has hired a special counsel to determine whether <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> used the book deal to circumvent <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> honoraria limits, has subpoenaed records from organizations that paid the fees as well as from publisher <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> amended his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> financial disclosure statements in recent months to list the 40 expense-paid speaking appearances, many of them in such locales as <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The speaking appearances include an engagement with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Podiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1986 where `` there was not even a mention of the book or books,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, director of government affairs for the group. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said a $ 2,000 check was sent to <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Piranha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, but he considered it `` from day one up to the current moment as a fee for the purpose of the senator making a speech to our audience.'' <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, who says he cleared the book deal through the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, contends he broke no <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules. Aides said he would not respond to questions about the deals now under investigation. The book deal is one of three plans <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> had for boosting his income at a time he was having financial and marital difficulties. Two of the arrangements are being looked at by the <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ the book matter and allegations that <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> arranged speeches in 1985 and 1986 to coincide with appointments he and his wife had with a marriage counselor in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The committee also could be asked to look at payments the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> made to <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> for his rental of a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> condominium in which he owned an interest. <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> says it was his idea, not <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>'s, to have <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Piranha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> division publish the two books _ `` Neither Madmen Nor Messiahs'' and `` Prescription for Change.'' But it was the senator's idea to use <ORGANIZATION> Piranha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> as a speaker's bureau to make money for both men from <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>'s appearances, <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> said He sold 13,000 copies of his books, not enough to cover the cost of printing them, <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> said. The $ 200,000 earned from the senator's speaking appearances enabled the publisher to net a $ 50,000 profit, said Diamond. `` That was not the intent. At the time we went into it we thought most of the money would be from the sales, but it just did n't work out that way. I thought we would sell more than we did,'' <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Diamond estimates special interest groups paid <ORGANIZATION> Piranha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> about $ 200,000 to hear <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> speak over the two-year period. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> ended the contract because of the criticism he received, although the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> concluded that payments from his publisher would constitute a stipend rather than speaking fees, he said. `` I believe I made a good faith effort to comply with the law by contacting the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> and seeking its opinion in advance of any work I did under the agreement,'' <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said in a statement his office issued recently. The complaint before the Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> contends <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> misrepresented the deal to the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> lists 23 appearances in 1985 in connection with the books, including trips to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and four cities in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. His 17 engagements in 1986 took him to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> twice and <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, once each. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> filed the amendments to his financial disclosure statements as a result of discussions between his aides and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Ethics Committee staff, said his press secretary, <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. The Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff has refused to comment on the investigation, but the senator's office confirmed the panel subpoenaed records about the speaking engagements.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, calling this year's holiday `` the Christmas we've awaited for 50 years,'' is urging Americans to celebrate by reaching out to someone in need. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with an assist from his 3-year-old granddaughter <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, threw a switch to light the National Christmas Tree on Thursday night, carrying on a tradition that <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> started in 1923. He used the ceremony before about 12,000 people opening the Pageant of Peace on the Ellipse both to celebrate `` the bells of freedom'' ringing across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and to nudge Americans once again to aid the less fortunate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> even got into the shopping spirit earlier Thursday, making a personal expedition to a local <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> store to buy presents _ clothing, not toys _ for his 11 grandchildren. He came prepared with a list and paid cash. Unlike his predecessor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who used to light the National Christmas Tree from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to the Ellipse to light the 35-foot living blue spruce, decorated this winter to symbolize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` thousand points of light.'' Describing the dramatic strides toward democracy that have unfolded in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, `` This is the Christmas that we've awaited for 50 years.'' Now, he said, `` 1989 is ending bright with the prospect of a far better Christmas time than <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has ever known; a far better future the world dared to imagine.'' With the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> wall tumbling down and `` spring'' returned to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, he said, `` The glad sound you hear is not only the bells of Christmas, but also the bells of freedom.'' Turning his thoughts toward home, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` We've worked hard this year, all of us, all of you, to help build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to help make this a kinder and gentler nation.'' But `` there remains a world of need all around us. In this holiday season, reach out to someone right where you live,'' he said. `` From now on in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, ` there's no room at the inn,' that's simply not an acceptable answer,'' said the president The National Christmas Tree is a living blue spruce transplanted to its permanent spot on the Ellipse in 1978. The ceremony, which kicked off the 1989 Pageant of Peace on the Ellipse, took place despite some star-crossed microphones. When singer <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> tried to belt out `` A Good Old Country Christmas,'' her cordless microphone flickered on and off. A stagehand gave her another mike. It was dead. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> corralled master of ceremonies <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, dressed in a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> suit, and began singing into the mike beneath his beard. `` I'm glad I had one beard to give for my country,'' quipped the jocular weatherman. Later, singer <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoo </PERSON> found herself without amplification, and pageant president <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> could n't be heard introducing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Some speakers cut off in mid-ceremony for the president. Before retreating to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leaned over and intoned into <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s beard _ site of the only reliable microphone _ `` <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>, you did a fine job.''

<HEAD>Founder of Company at Heart of Scandal Denies Bribery Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, the head of a company that brought down a government by plying it with favors, said in court today that the gifts he gave to politicians were not meant as bribes. The 53-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> chief told Judge <PERSON> Tadatsugu </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> that he accepted the prosecution's allegations that he provided gifts and bargain-priced stock to influential figures. `` These events did occur, but I do not agree with the substance of the charges,'' <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> said. `` I had absolutely no intention of committing bribery. ... I apologize for causing social disorder.'' Also denying bribery charges were Recruit executive <PERSON> Toshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> and two politicians: former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Takao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> and <PERSON> Katsuya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> of the opposition Clean Government party. If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to five years in prison. Their trial is the last of five that began Nov. 22 in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>. More than just legal proceedings, the court actions are examinations of the cozy relationship between Japanese government and business. The Recruit scandal began in summer 1988 and brought down Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who resigned last spring after acknowledging he received large donations from the giant information services conglomerate. Other key figures in the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have been sidelined by the scandal and the honesty of ranking bureaucrats has been questioned because of gifts they accepted from Recruit. Like the other three defendants, <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> accused prosecutors of mistreating him. `` The prosecutors questioned me from morning to night. When I tried to close my eyes they forced me to keep them open to the point that they hurt so bad that tears were flowing,'' he said. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, 56, was chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary under Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s predecessor. He is accused of receiving the equivalent of $ 140,000 and 10,000 shares in <LOCATION> Recruit-Cosmos </LOCATION>, a subsidiary whose stock was offered to influential people at a reduced price before it was sold publicly. Prosecutors say he put pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> not to change the traditional season for recruiting college graduates, which would have hurt Recruit's sales of job-placement magazines. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> denied the allegations. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> said he had been unaware of both the political donations from Recruit and the share-dealing, which was done by an aide. <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON>, 52, is charged with receiving $ 14,000 for himself, $ 35,000 for his wife and 5,000 shares in Recruit-Cosmos for his brother. According to prosecutors, he gave pro-Recruit speeches in Parliament in return. <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> resigned his seat; <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> remained in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, but resigned from his party. <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, a 39-year-old former company department head who faces two counts of giving bribes, denied the allegation. The other trials involve six bureaucrats and two other Recruit executives. Prosecutors must show the point at which a gift becomes a bribe. Japanese law says bribery occurs when a public official or politician receives money or valuables from people or companies the official is in a position to supervise. Recruit offered millions of discount shares in Recruit-Cosmos to hundreds of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen before the stock was available to the general public. When it was offered on the over-the-counter market, the price of the stock shot up and the insiders made large profits. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>'s shares were said to have gained him $ 215,000

The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it is considering how to alert physicians to reports from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> that high doses of generic cytarabine, made by <ORGANIZATION> Quad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, may have more serious neurological side effects than are caused by low doses of the drug. The reports were presented to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Oncologic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday at an emergency meeting called by the agency `` because of the serious nature of the problem.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinsler </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> pharmacologist, estimated as many as 3,000 leukemia patients may be candidates for high-dose cytarabine therapy _ about 30 times the normal dose. An official said the concerns were not prompted by <PERSON> Quad </PERSON>'s legal problems with the agency's generic drug division. Earlier this year, the company and a former executive pleaded guilty to charges of bribing <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> chemists to win approval of generic drug applications. Cytarabine is known to have neurological side effects, including loss of muscular coordination and slurred speech. But in high doses it appears these side effects may be more prevalent and more severe, said Dr. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s oncology division `` Nothing is very definitive,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` It's like a flag signal.'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said the action the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> takes to alert physicians to the reports will depend on whether Quad decides to take similar action on its own, although he said some action will be taken within the week. Quad officials did not return a telephone call for comment late in the day Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> investigation could not determine whether any patients had died as a result of the effects of the Quad drug. Most of the patients being treated at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>'s medical center were on a combination of drugs, were in advanced stages of the disease and could have had other side effects of the cytarabine, which also suppresses bone marrow and damages the liver, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> was alerted to the possible problem by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> last summer. The medical center returned to using <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>'s brand-name Cytosar after the side effects of the Quad product were noticed. Analyses of samples of the brand name and generic drugs found they both meet <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> standards, and neither drug appears to cause an unusually large number of neurological problems when used in normal doses, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials are concerned that when used in high doses, impurities in the Quad drug may worsen the side effects. Impurities resulting from the manufacturing process are different in the two drugs, he said. At high doses the `` relative amount of impurities could make a difference,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. The problem could extend to other drugs when they are used in high doses because all drugs contain a certain amount of impurities, he said. He noted doctors have found success in high anti-cancer drug dosages, and because of that, physicians are increasing dosages above the level for which the drug was approved. In the case of cytarabine, the high doses were about 30 times the regular dose, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> high-dose patients found eight of 25 patients on the Quad drug experienced neurological side effects, while three of 34 patients on the <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> drug had these effects, <PERSON> Rinsler </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Poindexter Says Reagan Fighting Subpoenas For Political Reasons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Iran-Contra defendant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> says former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is trying to avoid political criticism in attempting to quash a subpoena for his diaries. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s lawyers challenged both <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to invoke executive privilege in their attempts to quash defense subpoenas for the former president's diaries and papers. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> moved to quash the subpoenas, but on legal grounds other than executive privilege. `` Obviously their legal position is carefully calculated to avoid subjecting them to the political consequences of their invoking the privilege, including the consequent public perception that Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are still attempting to hide the true facts regarding their involvement in the so-called Iran-Contra affair,'' <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s lawyers said in a court filing. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, who is accused of lying to congressional inquiries about his involvement in the arms-for-hostages deals and covert assistance to Nicaraguan rebels, underscored his desire to call <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a witness at the trial. `` Documents produced in response to the defendant's subpoena are no substitute for Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s live testimony. Indeed, that live testimony may be essential to the jury's understanding of those documents,'' the defense brief said. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s filing in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was made in response to motions by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to quash subpoenas for documents in the possession of the former president and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>. In its brief, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> `` the unique and sensitive nature of the documents sought by defendant mandates extreme prudence in fashioning a procedure governing their potential disclosure.'' <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> received the judge's permission to subpoena the documents to try to show that he believed his actions in the Iran-Contra affair were legal and authorized by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> so that he would have no motive to lie about them. `` If Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is concerned about the impact of this case upon the prerogatives of the presidency, then they should invoke executive privilege,'' <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s lawyers said. `` Otherwise, they are just wasting the court's and the defendant's time.

 What was thought to be a raven attacking kids at the Winona Day Care Center in southeastern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> turned out to be a crow that seemed to just care a lot about people. On Wednesday, a group of preschoolers sang and danced around the bird, which played tug-of-war with sticks and tried to land on toddlers' heads. `` When a crowd of kids goes out on the playground, he feels he has to come over and play,'' said teacher <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffmaster </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hoffmaster </PERSON> and receptionist <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said the bird also liked to pick up pencils and other items, which it dropped on cars. But because the crow scared many of the children, it was captured later Wednesday by security guard <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreisher </PERSON> Sr. and <PERSON> Hoffmaster </PERSON> and put into a cage. <PERSON> Kreisher </PERSON> said he plans to free the bird unless it is claimed in the next couple of days. `` I figure he's got a right to live.

 The man charged with killing 27 people in what police call the nation's worst alcohol-related traffic accident publicly apologized for an act he claims to be unable to recall. Testifying Thursday in front of a chart with the victims' photographs and names, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said he had no recollection of driving the wrong way on Interstate 71 on May 14, 1988, and colliding with the packed church bus `` It's a fact I was involved in an accident, but I do n't remember seeing the bus,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said `` I remember waking up in the hospital.'' He concluded his 70 minutes on the witness stand by apologizing to the survivors and families of those maimed or killed in the disaster. `` I really am sorry and I mean this,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said, his voice tight with emotion. `` I know it's not going to make you feel any different toward me.'' Members of the victims' families, and <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s family, broke into tears. Behind <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was a large seating chart of the church bus that carried 67 passengers, the names of those killed designated with a black letter `` D.'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> faces multiple life sentences if convicted of the charges: 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton endangerment, 12 counts of assault and a count of drunken driving. Defense attorney <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was relieved after taking the stand. `` He did n't have to tell me. ... It was readily apparent,'' <PERSON> Baldani </PERSON> said. The trial recessed until Monday, when both defense and prosecution will call rebuttal witnesses. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, a factory worker, said he was upset the day of the crash over a variety of personal problems: his attempts to reconcile with his estranged wife, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON>; his declaration of bankruptcy because of large medical bills for a daughter's health problems; and attempts, thwarted by bad credit, to buy a new trailer for his family. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said the problems were not an excuse for his drinking and driving. Prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said of <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s testimony: `` When you compare bankruptcy, and how do I get a double-wide trailer ... to the fact that you no longer have a son or a daughter, or the survivors who will wear the badges of his mistake for the rest of their lives, it sort of pales in significance.'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> described stopping for beer at two bars and a liquor store on the Saturday afternoon of the crash and drinking with friends and while driving to see an ex-girlfriend, his parents and a friend. He described asking for a beer at a small party after giving a friend the keys to his truck. No beer was available, and a man offered him a mixed drink. A clear liquid <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> could n't identify was poured into a glass. `` I took a big drink of it and I coughed and choked on it,'' he said. Some of the men laughed at his reaction, he recalled, adding that he drank a soft drink to get rid of the taste. In previous testimony, witnesses said the soft drink was mixed with vodka, but <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said he could n't taste anything in it. Nor did he remember getting the keys to his truck and driving away, he said. <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> said he had problems with <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s `` selective memory.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s lead attorney, said he will attempt to introduce evidence about <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> next week. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> manufactured the chassis of the 1977 school bus involved in the wreck. The defense contends that the design of the bus, built before federal safety standards were tightened, contributed to the deaths.

<HEAD>Observers Describe Violence at Nicaraguan Election Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House says a bipartisan panel's report on bloody violence at a rally in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> raises the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's concerns that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> do n't intend to hold a fair election Members of the panel on Thursday gave President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a firsthand account of the bloodletting last weekend that they said was caused by <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> supporters wielding machetes. Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the delegation met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for 30 minutes, displaying photographs and videotapes of people whose arms had been severed. At least one person was killed in the violence, officials have said. `` Our point was that unless something is changed dramatically now ... people will be afraid to vote'' in the Feb. 25 election, said delegation member <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, a political consultant who was <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign manager. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the group's report `` only heightens'' concerns that the Sandinistas wo n't hold a fair election as scheduled in February <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the White House gave additional credence to the group's report because <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> opposes aid to the U.S.-backed Contras. <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> told reporters although he was disturbed by the events, he remained opposed to Contra aid. The group said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agreed to help arrange a meeting with the Contras in an effort to get a pledge that the rebels wo n't instigate violence during the election Members of the group said supporters of the leftist government violently disrupted a Sunday rally held by backers of opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> in the town of <LOCATION> Masatepe </LOCATION> and that a Sandinista police chief refused entreaties to stop the fracas. <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, called the <LOCATION> Masatepe </LOCATION> violence `` an isolated incident'' and said the opposition has held more than 50 peaceful rallies since campaigning began. Ambassador <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Einaudi </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said Thursday that there had seven incidents of violence or intimidation since Nov. 1, when the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> lifted their unilaterally declared cease-fire against the Contra rebels. `` Despite many fine words about good intentions, the reality of the violence is ... preventing the elections from channelling the conflict into the political foms that could give Nicaraguans hope for a more peaceful future,'' <PERSON> Einaudi </PERSON> said in a speech to a regular session of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Members of the American group said <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> observers missed most of the violence and later deliberately downplayed the Sandinista involvement by saying it was impossible to say who started the violence or who played a major role. The delegation said in its report that observers arrived to find a rock-throwing battle involving about 100 people. The American delegation and two <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> observers `` moved through the crowd, urging calm.'' One of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> observers told the Americans the fracas began when opposition supporters were set upon by a small group of <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> backers who taunted them and threw rocks. After the nearby political rally concluded, several bands of Sandinista youths charged into the crowd with rocks, nail-studded sticks and machetes, the report said. The observers said they tried to help break up the fracas and later sought out the police chief to intervene. The police chief said he did n't want to intervene because he feared he would be accused of interrupting an opposition rally, but finally agreed to accompany them to the site of the fracas, the report said. The trip by the 15-member American delegation was sponsored by the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, which has sent election observers to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> invited the center to send a team to monitor election preparations.

 Some kiddies who write to Father Christmas get right to the point, saying what they want _ `` a doll and a best friend,'' `` to get my cast off.'' Others ask only for the clothes their parents ca n't afford. Some are concerned that <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> be able to find their house _ and get in once he arrives. Every single one claims to have been good. `` Santa, this year I do n't want toys,'' wrote <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON>. `` I need a coat for me and my brother ... my mother is good but she ca n't buy me a new coat, but I know you can. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON>, the mother of `` two beautiful little girls whose father has deserted them,'' asked <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> to explain why her children would n't get presents this Christmas. Coping with a full-time job and attending college, she wrote that some paydays she ca n't even afford food. `` What I would like is for <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> to write my girls and explain why Christmas is not just a time for presents but also a time for sharing and being with your family. It is so hard for children to understand why <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> skips our house.'' By Christmas, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimates, 250,000 children will have sent letters to the North Pole. Every year, many requests are opened at local post offices and passed on to his helpers _ social service agencies, charities, community groups and people with deep pockets. This Christmas, many of the letters are being opened by his elves in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its employees have contributed money and manpower to screen <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s mail and to be sure he knows where he is most needed. The company is donating 5 cents for each letter received, up to 2 million letters, to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION> for Tots Program. What are the elves reading? Letters like these. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>, 4, asked for a shaving kit, `` so I could shave my face with daddy,'' and for `` a pretend blender.'' A note with no name _ but <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> knows anyway, does n't he? _ asked how he and the reindeer were doing and then told him, just so he'd know, that `` somebody here was a little bad this year, but it could not be me.'' The child with no name asked for a computer and cross-country skis, among other things. Likewise, <PERSON> Caitlin </PERSON> wrote: `` I have been a good girl. My brother has not.'' <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON> asked for `` a doll and a best friend.'' <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> said: `` I just want to get my cast on my arm off. I also do n't want my sister to get married.'' <PERSON> Shayla </PERSON> wanted to be sure <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> had directions to her house. `` You come down a dead end street. You will see a store. Next to the store you will see a blue house. ... Ring the door bell because the door is locked.'' <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON>, who wants a doll house and race cars, asked <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> `` how you and your elves get all the presents delivered in one night.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would probably like to know that too. <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON>, who has muscular dystrophy and ca n't walk, told <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> he'd like a remote-control race car, but added: `` I am happy to receive anything you send me. I'm a teen-age boy who has been raised by my single mom who has taught me to be grateful.'' Seven-year-old <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON>, confined to a wheelchair and with `` health problems that keep me most of the time in the hospital,'' asked for clothes and a musical toy. He also put in a plug for his sister, who takes care of him like a `` second mommy,'' and for his two brothers _ `` my best friends.'' <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, 2 years and 3 months old, wrote with an adult's help to ask for a pair of pants, shoes, `` a jacket with a hat and a teddy bear.'' She told <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> that she does n't have a father and that her mother is 16. `` I would like a gift from you because you are going to be my father,'' she added. Among the requests _ for doll houses and race cars, for a best friend and a sister who wo n't marry, for shoes and a warm coat _ was a postcard in an adult hand from a ritzy hotel in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> wrote: `` Thank you so very much for all you do for all the people in the world. I'm very content in life. I do n't want to ask for anything. I'd just like to encourage you to keep up the good work!'' She drew a heart next to her name.

<HEAD>American Airline In-Flight News to Lack Air Crash Video</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American Airline flights will feature taped <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> newscasts without pictures of plane crashes, after <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> balked at the airline's request that it cut such stories from its in-flight programs. American did not renew its six-year contract with the `` CBS Morning News'' and the last program will be shown on the airline before Feb. 28, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. Under American's guidelines, he said, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has pulled entire news programs with reports of airline crashes or `` virtually anything detrimental to the airlines.'' But <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> refused American's request to delete adverse airline news `` and deliver the remainder of the show,'' he said. American's rationale may be to avoid alarming passengers, but `` it's like passing out newspapers with holes cut in them,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said Thursday. American's decision to drop <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was financial and was n't based on an editorial dispute, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the airline, `` We did n't feel we were earning enough profit from our agreement with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. But she said the new <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> arrangement, in which video portraying airline crashes will be deleted, was worked out after American's surveys showed that its passengers complained that pictures of airline crash scenes disturbed them American's new in-flight agreement for <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> newscasts is with <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s Atlanta-based cable empire that merchandises <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> programs and other ventures. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> said it hopes to have news programs aboard 144,000 American flights annually by the end of 1990. Its newscasts will begin in March with eight domestic flights. He declined to disclose the value of the contract. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, a vice president of <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s merchandising division, said the American-CNN contract is expected to be signed next week, and editorially `` is limited to -LRB- stories about -RRB- air crashes.'' `` There will not be any other wholesale editing of our product,'' he said. `` Above all, we have to preserve the journalistic integrity of our network.'' <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> called the agreement `` a common-sense approach to crashes aboard those jets.'' `` It is unreasonable to expect airline passengers to sit and watch a graphic portrayal of an airline tragedy,'' he said. But <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` As a passenger, it would probably make me feel better, but as a journalist, it does n't.'' <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> said none of the other 10 airlines using <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> have asked for edited versions of the news, which is recorded from live feeds. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said the agreement would n't mean a complete blackout of such stories. `` What the contract with <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> calls for is that <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> will not show the video,'' she said. `` They will talk, in the audio portion, about these kinds of incidents. But they will not show the video.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, chairman of the telecommunications department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, said the agreement could hurt <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s reputation as being free from taint and bias `` What <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> has built its reputation on has been that it has not avoided the hard issues. They've never, to my knowledge, edited news content,'' <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said.

 Conductor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> led the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s newest orchestras, in an enlightening debut at the nation's most venerable concert showcase: Carnegie Hall. This unique ensemble of young professionals was formed only two years ago, at a time when orchestras everywhere faced money problems. It bills itself as the only full-time, full-size training orchestra in the country. Its players are recent college graduates, ranging from ages 21 to 30. The musicians sign on for no more than three years. The ensemble's alumni already number more than 30. In short, the Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> is an orchestra in perpetual transition. But that did n't mar Thursday night's performance, whose diverse program ranged from a Beethoven symphony to `` <LOCATION> Bamboula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> _ The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bamboula </LOCATION>'' by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wuorinen </PERSON>. Aside from a botched horn entrance here or a flat flute solo there, the 80 musicians played with great discipline. The biggest gaffe of the night was minor _ <PERSON> Tilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' premature entrance after intermission, before the orchestra tuned up. The still youthful <PERSON> Tilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who at age 44 is the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s artistic director and principal conductor of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Symphony Orchestra, held the playing firmly together. The concert got off to a jolt with the raucous `` <LOCATION> Bamboula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>,'' a composition commissioned by the <PERSON> Tilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> for the ensemble's inaugural performance in February 1988. `` The word ` bamboula' _ originally a <ORGANIZATION> Creole </ORGANIZATION> dance _ refers to a series of otherwise musically unrelated works of mine which all share a certain lightness of spirit,'' the Pulitzer prize-winning <PERSON> Wuorinen </PERSON> explained in the program notes. It was the first <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> performance for the short, energetic piece, whose dissonance is punctuated by the percussion section. It even included a solo for the steel drum. The composition sometimes sounded like a ride on a subway train, but it was a fun trip, ending in a smash not a crash. Next was <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Coplaonstrating </PERSON> tremendous discipline after the heart-pounding finale of `` Bamboula.'' The composition's many solos provided a chance to the musicians, especially the strings and woodwinds, to display their skills. For the most part, they seized the opportunity. <PERSON> Tilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> also chose an unfamiliar version: the complete symphonic score rather than the often-played suite from the 1944 ballet. Some audience members grumbled that they could see why the extra 10 minutes were cut. For others, however, the additional material took the listener into new recesses of the composition, especially after the Shaker variations. In a bow to traditionalists, the program ended with <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s `` Symphony No 7 in A Major.'' The rhythmic, generally whimsical composition provided the exuberant <PERSON> Tilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> with a podium showpiece. He conducted it without a score, jabbing his baton toward the players and giving an occasional leap and foot stomp without distracting the listener. After a standing ovation, he returned with members of the orchestra who did not have parts in the <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> for an encore, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s prelude to Act 3 from `` Lohengrin.'' `` I would n't want to end the night without everyone on stage,'' he told the audience.

<TEXT>
 The key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed at another record high on Friday despite a morning setback, while the dollar rose against the Japanese yen. The dollar closed at 144.30 yen, up 0.23 yen from Thursday's close of 144.07 yen After opening at 144.30 yen, the dollar ranged betwen 144.25 and 144.38 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 90.34 points for a record closing of 38,271.04. The index's previous record closing was the 38,180.70 points set Thursday. Trading was inactive because of the expected release later Friday of monthly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic figures, including trade data for October and producer prices and industrial production data for November, dealers said. The Nikkei slipped shortly after trading began as market players, who were already worried about the speed of recent rises in the index, stepped to the sidelines. But it recovered later after intermittent index-buying by foreign securities firms, the dealer said. Index-buying is a tactic that involves the purchase of at least 1,000 shares in all 225 Nikkei issues. In currency dealings, currency rates moved narrowly in inactive trading, in which market players awaited the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic data, said <PERSON> Toru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON>, a foreign exchange analyst with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The dollar-yen rate moved very tightly, while market players were just making position adjustments on the West German mark,'' he said. <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON> added that investors in general become reluctant to make major moves toward the end of the year to avoid possible risks during the Christmas and New Year holidays.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a text of <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s final public statement, a call to create a formal opposition to the Soviet Communist Party. It was made hours before his death Thursday to opposition members in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. It was translated from Russian by The Associated Press: I support the formula of opposition. What is opposition? First, we can not take on ourselves responsibility for what the leadership is doing now. It is leading the country to catastrophe, prolonging the process of perestroika many years. It will leave the country in a condition in which everything progressive will be destroyed during these years. All the plans for transition to a market and perestroika-type economy appear to be unrealistic. Dissatisfaction is growing in the country, and this dissatisfaction makes the revolutionary path of development impossible. The only possible path of revolutionary development is the radicalization of perestroika. At the same time we declare ourselves an opposition, and take the responsibility for the solutions we suggest. This is another side of the same term -LRB- opposition -RRB-, which is extremely important as well. At this moment, we live in conditions of a deep crisis of trust in the party and the leadership. This can be eliminated only by resolute political measures. The exclusion of Article 6 of the constitution and of the articles in line with Article 6 is a political move, not purely juridicial or organizational. This is a most significant political act right now in this country, and not in a year when work over the new text of the constitution will be completed. Then all this will no longer be in doubt. We need to accelerate the process of perestroika now. The last thing we need is to make certain the position of our <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The population of the country puts great hope in the group. But we began losing the trust of the people. The last matter I wanted to speak about is whether the political strike was a present for right-wing forces, and whether an opposition group will be one as well. I categorically disagree with both statements. What happened in the past week is the most powerful politicalization of the country. Discussions embrace the entire country. It is not important whether there were a lot of strikes or not. They were quite numerous, including strikes in the <LOCATION> Don </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION> and many other places. But this fact is not of principal importance. It is important that the people at last have found a means to express their will and readiness to support us politically. And we can not lose this support. The only possible response from us is our political position. They do not need anything else.

<TEXT>
 A district attorney said he will do everything he can to keep <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> behind bars, despite a decision overturning the death row inmate's conviction for the rape-slaying of a teen-ager. <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Speers </PERSON> said Thursday he still believes <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> killed <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fergeson </PERSON> nine years ago and that he will ask the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to change its decision. `` I believe the opinion is wrong,'' <PERSON> Speers </PERSON> said. `` If this opinion stands, the door will be wide open for convicts to manipulate weak-willed witnesses, invent witnesses and pervert the entire criminal justice system. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s first trial ended with a hung jury. An all-white jury from the second trial convicted <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> of raping and strangling the 16-year-old girl while she was attending a volleyball tournament in 1980 at <ORGANIZATION> Conroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> worked as a janitor. The appeals court ruled Wednesday that <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>, who has been on death row for nearly nine years and has had two execution dates, was the victim of an unfair trial. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s attorneys and supporters claim the investigation and prosecution was racially motivated since <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> is black and Miss <PERSON> Fergeson </PERSON> was white. His attorneys also say they're confident of acquittal in a third trial, but doubt there is sufficient evidence to prompt another trial. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>, 38, has said he would welcome a new trial. <PERSON> Speers </PERSON> said he would exhaust all legal avenues, including a third trial, to keep <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> behind bars. `` If this result stands, it is possible, even likely, that he will have literally gotten away with murder,'' <PERSON> Speers </PERSON> said. `` I believe this would be a gross miscarriage of justice.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeshan </PERSON>, the original prosecutor on <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s case and now a district judge in <LOCATION> Conroe </LOCATION>, agreed. `` I remain convinced, based on the evidence I saw, that <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> murdered <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Fergeson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Keeshan </PERSON> said. `` I am concerned about what effect this decision will have on future cases where orchestrated events years after the trial may result in the overturning of convictions.'' In the 86-page opinion, the appeals court said the investigative team failed to follow up leads from witnesses, failed to take blood and hair samples from other janitors who had been <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s chief accusers, provided an opportunity for a common account of the incident from the janitors, threatened witnesses and lost evidence from the trial. Three white janitors testified in the first trial that they had seen <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> follow Miss Fergeson to a restroom. But when one of the men recanted his testimony, he was not called to testify in the second trial. <PERSON> Speers </PERSON> said he probably will not file a motion with the appeals court until next week. If the court rejects his request to reverse its decision, he said he would consider an appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s attorneys are seeking a personal recognizance bond for him. The appeals court rejected bond Wednesday.

<HEAD>Judge Calls White House Crack Effort `Keystone Kops Thing'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The judge in the trial of a teen-ager accused of selling federal officials crack cocaine across the street from the White House called the government effort to show how easy it is to buy drugs was a `` <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kops </ORGANIZATION> thing.'' First the alleged drug dealer did n't show up to make the sale in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> special agent <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON> testified Thursday. Next the undercover officer's body microphone malfunctioned. Then the cameraman videotaping the deal missed the action because he was being assaulted by a homeless woman. `` This is like a <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kops </ORGANIZATION> thing,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> exclaimed as the government presented evidence against alleged drug seller <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 18, whose trial continues today. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> officials set up the Sept. 1 drug sale to show how easy it is to buy illegal drugs, even in the shadow of the White House. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used the story of the sale as an illustration during his Sept. 5 nationwide speech about the war on drugs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is charged with four counts of distributing crack at three locations in the nation's capital between April 24 and Sept. 1. If convicted, he faces life in prison without parole. <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON> said his boss asked him Aug. 31 to set up a drug deal near the executive mansion. `` He just walked into my office and said, ` Can you make a drug buy around 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue?''' <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON> testified, adding, `` I had 24 hours to buy three ounces of crack.'' Presidential speech writers conceived the idea of having <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hold up a bag of crack during his anti-drug speech last summer while the president was on vacation in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed the idea, and White House officials called a top aide to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, who in turn contacted the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON> said the first dealer he set up a meeting with did n't show. Then, a meeting was arranged with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> officials said that their efforts to get <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to the park almost failed because <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did n't know where the White House was. <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON> also <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was supposed to hand the three-ounce bag of crack to <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON>, instead gave it to the informer to hand to the agent.

 <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> received a hero's welcome and proclaimed she was innocent of hiding munitions in her yard in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> as she greeted 350 residents who turned out in freezing cold to cheer her return <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, who said she maintained neutrality while giving visiting Americans tours of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> during four years there, said Thursday night she will speak out against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Salvadoran government now that she has been expelled. Casolo arrived in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Wednesday, then flew Thursday to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where she fielded questions from reporters at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> before being driven the 75 miles to <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION> in a Cadillac with Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., who had lobbied for her release from a Salvadoran prison <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> embraced her father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, and met close friends and relatives, including her brother, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, who were waiting for her in the Town Hall of the town of 7,000 people. `` I want to thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart for all the prayers and letters,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> told the crowd outside. `` You've really made this the merriest Christmas we've ever had.'' <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, standing on a flatbed truck draped in red, white and blue bunting, wished the crowd `` Feliz Navidad'' and _ when a sound system failure forced her to use a big megaphone _ joked about her days as a cheerleader at <ORGANIZATION> Thomaston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. She left <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday after a judge dropped terrorism charges against her for lack of evidence and ordered her deported. Casolo, who worked in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminars </ORGANIZATION> since 1985, was arrested Nov. 26 after authorities raided her rented house and unearthed dynamite, grenades and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition from the garden. She said her tribulations were minor compared to those of the Salvadoran people, 70,000 of whom have died in a decadelong civil war. But the disrespect with which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities dealt with her case demonstrated their cynicism toward <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s people, she said `` It's shameful. It's disgraceful,'' she said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` How can the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration say they're working to create a just society in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> when they ca n't even treat an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen with the rights of a just society? `` I tried to convey to the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> police that a person is innocent until provent guilty but I did n't know that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials were n't giving me that right.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials did not press for her release and had said they thought she was probably guilty. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> said she had a great love for the Salvadoran people and would not `` feel free'' until all political prisoners were released there. The Salvadorans `` deserve a country where they can eat, where their children can go to school, where they do n't have to worry about being dragged away in the middle of the night,'' <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> said. Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said he was convinced of her guilt, despite her release. Asked about that Thursday night, <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> said simply, `` I'm innocent.'' She went on: `` Maybe those weapons were there. Maybe a Salvadoran guerrilla tipped them off ... but there's just as much possibility that they beat the hell out of someone to get them to say it _ and excuse my language.'' Of the weapons cache, she said, `` I do n't know if it was there, if they put it there or if someone else put it there and I do n't think I'll ever know. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> urged an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` For four years I worked in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. ... During that time I kept my mouth shut,'' she said. `` It's time for me to talk, so that others better understand what has happened.'' After the official homecoming at <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> headed for a private reunion with her mother, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, who did not attend the welcome ceremony because she wanted to greet her daughter privately.

<TEXT>
 The imprisonment of a former black civil rights activist resulted from racial polarization in the state, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s lawyer said after a racially split vote by a pardon board to reduce his sentence. The board voted 3-2 Thursday to recommend that Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> reduce the life sentence for <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, who at 16 was condemned to die for the 1974 slaying of a white student during a racial confrontation. The death sentence was automatically changed to life when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s old death penalty law in 1976. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s conviction has withstood all appeals, but the vote would make him eligible for parole in five years. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> will make a decision within a few weeks, his aides said. Parole eligibility is n't the same as freedom for <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, 31, whose entire adult life has been spent in the state prison at <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, said attorney <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>. `` If <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> was white we would n't be here today,'' she told reporters after the pardon board meeting. `` We still do n't see the kind of justice we want in this state.'' The vote _ three black members for reduction in sentence and two whites against _ is representative of `` racial polarization,'' said <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>. `` It's pretty amazing,'' she said. `` In 1985 in Ascension Parish a white kid shot to death an unarmed black kid at a school and was indicted for manslaughter. He was placed on probation and told to finish his education and pay the funeral costs of the victim. `` And, then we have <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, a black kid who police said had a ` smart mouth.''' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and other human rights organizations have urged freedom for <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, as have more than 12,000 people who signed petitions to the pardon board. The British reggae band UB40 recorded a song about <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> and he was described by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda in 1978 as a political prisoner. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, said she was happy with the decision, but believes board members would have voted for an immediate release had they interviewed him. Board members routinely do not interview inmates unless they are facing death. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> was active in a school desegregation battle in October 1974 that drew the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and state police to <LOCATION> Destrehan </LOCATION>, a small town on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> 25 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. One day, whites surrounded buses of black students at <ORGANIZATION> Destrehan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, shouting and hurling bottles, cans and rocks. A shot was fired from one of the buses. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a white student standing with his mother across the schoolyard, fell dead. Witnesses said the pistol was held by a gloved hand. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> was the only one on the bus wearing gloves, said police. Those who believe <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> was framed say that a student who testified against him was known as a liar and that police planted a pistol found in the stuffing of the torn seat where <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> had sat.

 Opposition leader <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> told his jubilant supporters today that Chileans have regained their freedom by electing him president, ending the dark era of military rule under Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. Chileans danced, waved national flags and set off fireworks to celebrate <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>'s landslide victory Thursday over <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, a pro-government candidate. Celebrations lasted into the morning in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and cities nationwide. The election was intended to bring back democracy to the last <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country still ruled by the military. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was forced to call the election after losing a referendum in October last year, in which voters rejected a military proposal that he remain as president until 1997. Speaking to hundreds of supporters early today from the third-floor balcony of a downtown hotel, <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> referred to the generations of democracy enjoyed by Chileans until <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> overthrew elected President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> in a bloody 1973 coup. `` <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has refound her history. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has regained liberty. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has regained democracy,'' said <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, who promised a government of national unity to repair the political and social divisions under the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> regime. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s government officially recognized <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>'s triumph. Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> said in a nationally broadcast address that authorities would abide by it. Official results from 93 percent of all polling stations in Thursday's election gave <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> 3,577,669 votes or 55.2 percent of all valid ballots. He was supported by a coalition of 17 parties ranging from right to left. <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s former finance minister and architect of a free market economy, had 1,901,668 votes or 29.4 percent. A third candidate, populist businessman <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON>, had 998,786 votes, 15 percent. <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> to congratulate him on his victory. His absolute majority and 2-1 advantage over his nearest pro-government challenger appeared to give him the mandate for a possible upper hand in future relations with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who has vowed to remain on as army commander. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, 71, a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> and former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president, is to begin a four-year term on March 11, when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s term ends. Much of his future authority was expected to depend, however, on results from Thursday's voting for the 38 elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and 120 House of Deputies seats. Up to 10 more senators are to be designated by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and other government bodies. Conclusive returns in the congressional races were not expected until later today. However, there were indications from preliminary, unofficial returns that the pro-government forces may have fared better in the congressional vote than in the presidential race. From the moment <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>'s victory became evident, supporters took to the streets, dancing and chanting or roaming in noisy caravans of buses, trucks and automobiles. They waved Chilean flags and party banners, blowing on horns and shooting off fireworks. Similar celebrations were reported in other large cities, and in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> resort city of <PERSON> Vina </PERSON> del Mar, national police used water cannons to clear the streets. Demonstrations are legally banned on election day. Police in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, who had blocked many anti-Pinochet protests and fired water cannons and tear gas at demonstrators in the past, did not intefere with the celebrations and even suspended traffic on the city's main boulevard to allow <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> supporters to listen to their leader's victory speech. `` It's forbidden,'' said a police lieutenant at the scene, `` but there's no problem.'' Ending his speech, <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> urged the demonstrators to return peacefully and to attend a celebration rally tonight. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, in a bref conversation with reporters, said he was not disturbed by <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>'s victory. `` They were better organized. They know how to do things,'' he said. The election was peaceful, with voters arriving early at the polls and waiting patiently in long lines, sometimes for hours, to cast their ballots. Nearly all 7.5 million elegible voters cast their votes. <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> said Chileans should take pride on the peaceful manner the election took place and for the high turnout, and praised the armed forces for maintaining order. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> lauded the `` maturity'' of the population, and also said the armed forces deserved praise for carrying out a clean election. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> becomes the eighth South American nation in a decade to return to civilian rule. Others include <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. In February, Paraguayan <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> ended more than three decades of rule by Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, overthrowing him and declaring a presidential election, which <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> won.

 Researchers say physicians fail to diagnose severe depression in half the patients who suffer the most common mental illness, and the problem is worse in prepaid health plans. `` Depression is quite serious, it's eminently treatable, and yet we're finding only half of patients are detected'' by doctors who are paid fees based on how much care they provide patients, said Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, the study's chief author. Only two-fifths of depressed patients were recognized by general practitioners, internists and other non-mental health specialists who were paid fixed fees in advance, regardless of how much care they provided, he added. Such doctors include those working for health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, and also physicians who provide prepaid care in solo and group practices. The study, published in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, involved 650 severely depressed patients and more than 500 doctors in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. It was conducted by researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Compared with general medical doctors' frequent failure to detect depression, psychiatrists and psychologists recognized more than 83 percent of seriously depressed patients, the researchers found. Such mental health specialists were equally likely to detect and treat depressed people regardless of how they were paid, said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> psychiatrist and senior researcher at Rand. `` I know depression is missed,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McElwee </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` All doctors have to be on the lookout for the depressed patient. This study will help raise everybody's level of awareness.'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Byer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> HMOs </ORGANIZATION>, said he could n't explain why prepaid doctors were less likely than others to recognize depression. But he said other studies show doctors in HMOs _ which were established to control spiraling medical costs _ `` deliver better care by not overprescribing drugs, procedures and hospitalization.'' Although everyone feels sad at times, 9.4 million Americans suffer clinical depression during any six-month period, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which calls depression `` the most common and treatable of all mental illnesses.'' `` One in four women and one in 10 men can expect to develop it during their lifetime. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of those who suffer depression can be effectively treated'' by medication or psychotherapy, an <ORGANIZATION> APA </ORGANIZATION> pamphlet said. Each year, depression spurs 20,000 suicides and costs $ 16 billion in lost productivity and medical expenses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a 1985 study found. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said depressed patients in his study felt sad `` all the time every day for at least two weeks, and also had at least three other symptoms of depression such as poor sleep or appetite, suicidal thoughts, difficulty concentrating, having no interest in things you normally enjoy.'' The researchers evaluated 22,462 patients who visited doctors regularly, using detailed diagnostic interviews to pick a representative sample of 650 severely depressed people. Studies in individual hospitals or clinics previously found doctors often do n't recognize depression. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said his study is easily the largest and the first to cover all major types of medical practice. He found general medical doctors paid on a fee-for-service basis detected only 54 percent of depressed patients, and prepaid doctors recognized only 42 percent of such people. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> speculated some doctors view treatment of depression as optional because some patients get well without help. Prepaid plans are meant to save money, so doctors working for such plans may be even less likely than others to watch for signs of depression, he said. HMO doctors `` are not encouraged to underserve patients,'' <PERSON> Byer </PERSON> said. `` Doctors are encouraged to deliver the right care.''

 An increasingly radical and disillusioned <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> fought until the end to keep the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on the path of reform started by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He died late Thursday while writing a speech to the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> demanding the Communists' constitutional guarantee to power be revoked, his family said. His last words to them were: `` Tomorrow there will be a battle.'' Hours earlier, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> made an uncompromising, if not eloquent, appeal to create a formal political opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and to build a multiparty democracy. `` We can not take on ourselves responsibility for what the leadership is doing now,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> group. `` It is leading the country to catastrophe, prolonging the process of perestroika many years.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s high-pitched voice, rambling style and stammer made him a poor public speaker, and despite the group's respect for him, the hum of other conversations in the hall increased as <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> spoke. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> spent his last several days working in the seat of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> power where, until just a few short years ago, he was roundly and regularly condemned. Having supported <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms in 1987 after the Soviet leader brought him back from internal exile, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had taken an increasingly critical view recently that brought him into conflict with his president. He and other radicals had called for a two-hour general strike Monday to press for elimination of Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution, which makes the Communist Party the `` leading and guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political system.'' His last exchange with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, shown on live television several hours after the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' winter session on Tuesday, was a bitter one. Having cut off another deputy who wished to take the podium, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> to address the 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> urged the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to strike `` all the articles hindering the passing of laws on land, property and other bills promoting perestroika.'' When he began to speak about the party's monopoly on power, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> halted him with a curt `` thank you.'' `` I am under the impression that neither you nor we will know how to realize your suggestion,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` Who is to define what articles to exclude?'' When <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and handed him a stack of telegrams in support of his position, the Soviet leader retorted: `` You come to me, I will give you three files of telegrams.'' Undaunted, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> continued to press the issue. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was elected one of five leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> when it was formed in August, and he recently had become one of its more radical and outspoken members. Dressed in a brown suit, he sat at the end of the head table, his chair pushed back and forehead in hand, at the group's meeting Thursday. With him at the table were the group's other leaders: historian <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, Communist maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and economists <PERSON> Gavriil </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Palm </PERSON>. The general strike he pressed for on Monday failed, and that tactic was widely criticized by <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> deputies Thursday. One deputy said the strike call was `` present No. 1'' to the conservatives controlling the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and that the formation of a political opposition would be `` present No. 2.'' Historian <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a long-time acquaintance who also serves in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview that Thursday had been a `` difficult day'' for <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. `` He was n't a politician, and did n't always realize the consequences of his actions, but he never gave in to circumstances,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said.

 Thousands of elderly people fall and fracture their hips because they take long-lasting sleeping pills, mainly Valium, <LOCATION> Librium </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dalmane </PERSON>, instead of shorter-acting drugs, a researcher says. The long-acting drugs are no more effective than related, shorter-acting drugs, but the long-acting drugs were developed first, and some doctors still are prescribing them to the elderly, said epidemiologist <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> is co-author of a study published in today's edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association that found people over 65 who took the long-lasting benzodiazepine drugs were 70 percent more likely to sustain hip fractures than those who took no such drugs. But shorter-acting benzodiazepines carried no higher risk, the study said. `` Hip fracture is a serious injury,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said. He noted that about 250,000 elderly people fall and break their hips annually in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, resulting in monetary costs of $ 6 billion. The human costs are even higher, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said: a 20 percent increased death rate in the year after the fracture; a loss of ability to walk unassisted among up to half the victims; and entry into nursing homes among up to a third of victims. Hip fractures mark `` the beginning of the end'' for many elderly people, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, an associate professor of preventive medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview Thursday. He estimated that 10 percent to 15 percent of people over 65 take benzodiazepine drugs, the most commonly prescribed tranquilizers and sleeping pills because of their effectiveness and relative safety. `` All have the side effects of reducing coordination and alertness,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said, but long-acting benzodiazepines require days to be eliminated while shorter-acting ones are largely eliminated in hours. He estimated thousands of hip fractures could be prevented each year if older people stopped using the long-acting drugs. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s team studied all the hip fractures reported among people 65 and older between 1977 and 1985 in <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, an area chosen because its health-care system has unusually complete records. The researchers compared use of benzodiazepine tranquilizers and sleeping pills among 4,501 victims of hip fracture and a control group of 24,041 Canadians matched for comparison. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said patients should be encouraged to seek non-drug alternatives that will help them relax or sleep, such as reducing caffeine intake, getting more exercise and going to bed later. Three drugs accounted for 95 percent of the long-acting medications taken by study subjects: diazepam, marketed as Valium; flurazepam, marketed as Dalmane; and chlordiazepoxide, marketed as <LOCATION> Librium </LOCATION>. All are manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nutley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattison </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, said Thursday, `` It's been generally recognized that there are some adverse effects like this on the elderly. But side effects of the short-acting drugs are less well-known and less predictable than those of longer-acting ones, she said. `` Research needs to be completed to identify geriatric patients that may be at highest risk of hip fracture at the same time as taking benzodiazepines,'' Ms. <PERSON> Mattison </PERSON> said. Short-acting benzodiazepines that accounted for 95 percent of those taken by subjects in the study were: triazolam, marketed as Halcion by the <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; oxazepam, marketed as Serax by <ORGANIZATION> Wyeth-Ayerst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phildelphia </LOCATION>; and lorazepam, marketed as Ativan by <ORGANIZATION> Wyeth-Ayerst </ORGANIZATION>.

 A former prostitute who accused the priest who founded a runaway shelter of financial and sexual improprieties is welcome to come back in off the streets, the Rev. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said after denying the charges. `` If he came back today we would welcome him back to <ORGANIZATION> Convenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said at a news conference Thursday. `` There are many people here who care very deeply about him.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> confirmed Wednesday he was investigating the man's charges of financial improprieties by <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>. The 20-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resident also reportedly claimed he had a sexual relationship with the Franciscan priest. `` I categorically deny these allegations,'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said. `` They are simply nonsense.'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> and the authorities have not publicly identified the man, but a law enforcement source identified him as <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said the charges were `` deeply offensive to me,'' and had seriously harmed the image of the charitable organization. An audit, he said, `` found our books in perfect order. Every penny is accounted for.'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> founded <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for homeless teen-agers in 1969 and has built it into an $ 85 million-a-year operation with seven shelters in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and four in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. More than 90 percent of its funding is private. Covenant House directly serves about 25,000 children annually, and its national telephone line gets about a million calls for help a year. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said the young man came to the agency early this year saying he was a runaway prostitute being pursued by organized crime. Covenant House in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> currently has about 150 other runaways in similar straits, he said. They are given special attention and a personal mentor. `` I chose to become his mentor because, frankly, I had more experience than anyone else,'' he said. Staff members took the man to their homes on special occasions, and <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> acknowledged traveling with him on a few occasions, but said there were no sexual relations. The man was enrolled at <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, but eventually dropped out and lapsed back into prostitution. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> blamed himself for not spending enough time with the young man. `` We tried so very hard, and we failed,'' he said. `` It is probably better to say that I failed. ... I thought I knew more than I did.'' Asked why the man would have accused him of such transgressions, <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> replied, `` I honestly, simply do not know.'' He said he last spoke with the man in early November, telling him to either go back to college or get a job. The man refused either option and left the apartment <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had provided him on Dec. 5, he said. The priest said he was most concerned that supporters `` have had their faith in me shattered,'' and would not be willing to continue their aid. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, who has pursued a vigorous travel schedule in recent years despite a bout with cancer, calls <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` an intensive care unit for dying children.'' `` We help about one-third of the kids that come in,'' he said in an interview last year. `` We lose the rest.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will ask a judge to set aside a $ 43.2 million judgment for a woman whose husband and two daughters burned to death in a 1982 car fire, officials said. Jurors in a state district court awarded $ 18.2 million in actual damages and $ 25 million in exemplary damages _ the largest ever against <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> _ to <PERSON> Nike </PERSON> <PERSON> Adegbite </PERSON>, 36, who watched as her family and two others were killed in the fire. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, vice president and general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said the company was surprised and disappointed by Wednesday's verdict, and will ask for a new trial. If the judge refuses, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> will appeal the judgment, <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Adegbite </PERSON> escaped with only minor burns and cuts from the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corona </ORGANIZATION> station wagon when it caught fire after being rear-ended by a van. Her husband, <PERSON> Adeyemi </PERSON>, 35, and her daughters, <PERSON> Yetunde </PERSON>, 7, and <PERSON> Adeloa </PERSON>, 8 months, were killed. The van's driver, <PERSON> Boyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Adetoye </PERSON>, received minor injuries, but his wife and child were killed. Mrs. <PERSON> Adegbite </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON>, said the lawsuit claimed <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> was negligent in its design of the station wagon and failed to recall it. The trial lasted six weeks. The attorney said Mrs. <PERSON> Adegbite </PERSON> and her family were in the back seat of the station wagon when it was struck on a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> highway Sept. 26, 1982. The van's impact pushed the station wagon's gasoline tank forward, <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> said, and the tank was punctured by an empty spare tire carrier and a valve on the rear axle <PERSON> Adetoye </PERSON> was not involved in the case because he had reached a settlement on a similar lawsuit about a year ago, <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> said. The settlement amount was not disclosed. <PERSON> West </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> has never had any other claims against the design of the vehicle. He added the company denies any defects or negligence in the vehicle's design. Lawyers on both sides expressed surprise at the size of the judgment. `` We were of course surprised at the verdict _ not only by the extraordinary amount, but that the jury decided against us,'' <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. Previously, the largest award against <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> was about $ 5 million, he said. Ms. <PERSON> Adegbite </PERSON> was surprised, too, said <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON>. `` I think everybody was. It was an emotional moment,'' he said.

 Patients and their families are launching their own drives to find bone marrow donors although they have only a slight chance of finding a stranger with the same tissue type. The extraordinary efforts are being undertaken because the nation's bone marrow registry of tissue-typed volunteers is growing yet lags painfully behind demand, experts say. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, is asking members of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Asian community to be tested in hopes of finding a donor for her son, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 20, a leukemia victim On Sunday, tests were performed on 117 people at a cost to the family of $ 75 per person, or $ 8,775. Results are expected in a few days. `` It's not for my son only,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> said. `` Every person I recruit goes into the national donor program.'' The problem her son and others face is that, on average, patients who are not lucky enough to have a relative with the same tissue type have only a one-in-20 ,000 chance of finding a stranger with the same type _ and chances are even worse for ethnic minorities and people with rare tissue types By comparison, there are basically only four blood types, making the matching of blood donors and recipients relatively easy. `` The only way to solve that problem is to have more -LRB- marrow -RRB- donors,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Fred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutchinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Bone marrow is the source of red and white blood cells, plus platelets required for clotting. It can be destroyed by disease, or as a side effect of treatment for cancer. More than 20,000 bone marrow transplants were performed worldwide on leukemia victims and other patients through 1987, the last year for which figures are available, said Dr. <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bortin </PERSON>. He is scientific director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Registry </ORGANIZATION>, a research group at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. About 98 percent were matches between siblings of identical tissue type, <PERSON> Bortin </PERSON> said. Two years ago today, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> performed the first transplant arranged through the federally funded National Marrow Donor Program. The bone marrow was removed from a 49-year-old medical secretary from <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> on Dec. 15, 1987, sent to the <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> center and injected the next day into leukemia patient <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. Even though it was a so-called perfect tissue match, there was still enough of a difference that <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>, now 8, has since suffered several bouts of graft-vs. - host disease, in which white blood cells from the transplanted marrow attack the host body, according to her mother, `` I did n't think we'd still be battling it two years down the road,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Wednesday. Still, she said, `` We had no other choice. It was either that or death. I would take this any day.'' She said doctors have told her the problem could lessen over time. The National Marrow Donor Program, located in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, currently lists about 70,000 potential donors for those without compatible siblings, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Quam </PERSON>. That includes 3,400 from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, which merged its program with the American registry last spring. Even with that number of potential donors, only about 10 percent of those who consult the national registry are matched and transplanted, said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>, the program's project officer for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION>, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s bone marrow registry, the world's largest with 130,000 names, also has a reciprocal sharing arrangement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as do <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Other Western European countries and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are expected to follow suit within six months. Getting people's tissue type determined so that their names can be entered in the registry takes only a blood test. But for those volunteers who are found to match the type of someone needing a transfusion, the actual donation of bone marrow requires general anaesthesia and up to a 48-hour hospital stay. The marrow is removed by means of a needle inserted into the pelvic bone. The government originally intended to have 100,000 potential donors by the third year of the registry, launched Sept. 1, 1987, said <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>. That target now is thought to be low. `` How many people would you have to have in a registry to assure everyone would have a donor? It's not known,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>'s Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadduck </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s adult bone marrow transplant program.

<HEAD>Troops Rushed to City After Coup Plan Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of troops were rushed to a major southern city amid reports today that rebel soldiers plan new attacks against President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Also today, the nation's leading cleric delivered an unusually strong attack on inefficiency and nepotism in the Aquino government, which has been deeply shaken by the failed coup that was launched Dec. 1. Prices tumbled in early trading on <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> until the government's social security system and other institutional investors intervened to prevent a feared collapse. Traders attributed the panic selling to Thursday's grenade attack on an American housing and recreational compound. There were no injuries and minor damage. But the incident raised fears of terrorism by remnants of military mutineers who tried to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The exchange's composite index of 25 selected issues plunged 59.73 points to close at 1,002.81, down 5.62 percent from Thursday's finish. Before the rally, exchange President <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> warned the market was `` collapsing and it has lost its sanity.'' Business sources have expressed concern that the Aquino government will be unable to cope with the economic, political and social effects of the failed coup. In <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION>, 560 miles south of here, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Baccay </PERSON> said 500 Marines were flown to the city early today from <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> to secure the airport, banks and other key installations following reports of rebel troop movements. <PERSON> Baccay </PERSON> told reporters that an unknown number of rebels had left their garrison, about 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION>, but it was uncertain where they were heading. Roadblocks had been set up near <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION>, the largest city on <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island. On Thursday, Sen. <PERSON> Aquilino </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON>, who comes from <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>, warned of a possible coup attempt on the island in the next two weeks. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Canieso </PERSON>, chief of the government intelligence service, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee that rebels were planning a new strike against the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> administration in the central Visayas islands and <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>. Canieso, a retired major general and former army commander, said 60 percent of the 160,000-member armed forces would accept whatever government emerged victorious in a future coup. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archbishop of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, called for stern punishment for mutineers but criticized the Aquino administration for its stewardship of the nation. `` The perpetrators of the coup must definitely be hunted down and punished,'' <PERSON> Sin </PERSON> told a conference of Filipino ambassadors. `` But beyond that, the presidency must be freed of every taint of nepotism. The fruits of economic recovery must be distributed more equitably.'' Sin has been among Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s most outspoken supporters since the 1986 `` people power'' uprising, when he called hundreds of thousands into the streets to join the revolution that toppled the late President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and put Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in power. During the speech, <PERSON> Sin </PERSON> said the country appeared quiet for the moment `` like the silence in the eye of a typhoon.'' `` Unsettling is the actual inefficiency in many branches of government,'' <PERSON> Sin </PERSON> said. `` Unsettling are the unceasing reports of the undue influence of presidential relatives in official government policy. ... Unsettling is the omnipresence still of so much poverty, so much suffering in our country.'' No group claimed responsibility for the grenade attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Seafront compound. But Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON>, chief of the police <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the attackers could have been rebel soldiers angry at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The incident followed threats against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests by rebel soldiers after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for government forces during the coup attempt, which ended Saturday. At least 113 people were killed in the eight-day coup.

<TEXT>
 A fire that killed four retirement home residents _ the fifth blaze in six months at a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> nursing or retirement home _ renewed a call for a study of fire safety in the state's housing for the elderly. The fire Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Shenandoah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> was the third fatal fire there in 13 years. It injured 23 people, but residents, rescue workers and TV cameramen ushered others to safety in early-morning cold. A preliminary report on the cause of the fire probably would be released today, said Capt. Mark Light of the <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fire and rescue department. After an Oct. 5 fire killed 12 residents of a nursing home in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, state Sen. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, D-Norfolk, drafted the bill calling for the fire-safety study. Lawmakers will consider it next year. `` It's sad that it takes a tragedy to get people to move,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said Thursday. The fire broke out shortly after 2 a.m. in a third-floor apartment at <ORGANIZATION> Shenandoah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION>. Only the second floor of the six-story building is licensed as a home for adults and regulated by the state. The remaining floors are considered a boarding home because residents require less medical care than in adult homes and nursing homes, state officials said. Residents, many wearing only pajamas, streamed out of exits into the 19-degree cold. Some were aided by wheelchairs and walkers and others were helped by fellow residents, rescue personnel and even TV cameramen. `` I left my walker, got my cane and everybody helped each other get out,'' said <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Branson </PERSON>, 78, wrapped in a blanket. `` It was just a marvel how these elderly people reacted under pressure,'' said <PERSON> Ottis </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgher </PERSON>, administrator of the 190-occupant facility. In 1976, a fire killed four residents of the <LOCATION> Shenandoah </LOCATION> home. Three months earlier, a blaze started by a dropped cigarette killed a woman. Fires struck a nursing home in <LOCATION> Albemarle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on Dec. 6, a retirement home in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION> on Oct. 25 and a nursing home in <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> on June 30. The fires prompted evacuations but caused no major injuries.

<UNK>Presidential Candidates Clash in TV Debate Two Days Before Vote ^By

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two candidates vying to become <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first popularly elected president in nearly three decades traded barbs and insults in a crucial nationwide debate. The 2 -LCB- - hour showdown between <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, a center-right former governor, and leftist <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> comes in the stretch drive of Sunday's election New polls show that <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> has erased a 15-point deficit in the last two weeks to make the race almost dead even. Both candidates ducked questions about inflation, expected to rise 50 percent in December alone. Instead they traded personal barbs during the debate that began Thursday and ended early today. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, shouting and shaking his fists in the air at times, called his socialist rival `` intolerant'' and `` backward'' and said the election of <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> would prompt nationwide strikes and economic chaos. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> labeled <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> as `` emotionally unstable'' and a member of the `` archaic upper class.'' <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, 44, a congressman of the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and former labor leader, instead focused on issues such as redistribution of land and wealth and state-funded health care and educational reforms. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said if elected he would suspend payments on <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s $ 110 billion foreign debt, the Third World's largest, and invest the money for social programs <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> paid $ 14 billion last year servicing its foreign debt, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, 40, the scion of a wealthy political clan and former governor of the tiny northeastern state of <LOCATION> Alagoas </LOCATION>, said a debt moratorium would hurt foreign investment and stunt economic growth. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate favored cuts in state spending and supported making several state-run companies private. `` The idea of turning our backs on our debt is flawed,'' <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> said. `` The present government has already stopped payments and where has it gotten us?'' <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has effectively halted all interest payments on its commercial debt since September. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> called land reform and housing programs essential for development in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. He said his government would donate plots of land to homeless families in cities and subsidize the construction of homes. He did not specify how the government _ strapped with an enormous internal debt and the burden of paying a bloated government staff _ would pay for these projects. Collor de Mello proposed offering incentives to private developers to ease the housing cruch. On Sunday, an estimated 82 million voters will go to the polls to choose <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first popularly elected president since 1960. Analysts say the election rides on how well each candidate portrays himself as the defender of the poor, who make up a majority of the electorate. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>'s promises to clean up corrupt government and sharp attacks on discredited President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> have been popular with poor Brazilians and gave him a plurality but not the required majority in elections last month. In the last two weeks, opinion polls say <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> has closed the gap rapidly, in part because of a strong performance in the candidates' first nationwide debate Dec. 3. The last popular election for president was in 1960, when <PERSON> Janio </PERSON> <PERSON> Quadros </PERSON> was elected. In 1964, the armed forces took power in a coup and ruled the country until 1985. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, a civilian, was chosen in an electoral college vote coordinated by the country's top generals.

 A man, his adopted teen-age daughter and her friend succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning as they waited in a car for a school bus that passed without stopping to help them, authorities said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McClain </PERSON>, 42, had driven his daughter, Misty, 15, and her friend, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, 16, to a bus stop Thursday to wait for the regular 7 a.m. bus, <LOCATION> Barbour </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Steerman </PERSON> said. All three apparently had lost consciousness by the time the bus stopped on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 119 and moved on at 7:22 a.m., <PERSON> Steerman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxson </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Maxson </PERSON>'s Salvage, a service station where the car was parked, said the 1977 <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> station wagon was `` steamed up'' and covered with a thin layer of snow when he and a co-worker found the bodies at about 8 a.m. as they opened for business. `` It was pretty cold and they lived up the hollow and he -LRB- <PERSON> McClain </PERSON> -RRB- just brought them down for the bus as he did every day,'' <PERSON> Steerman </PERSON> said. `` They usually had to wait about seven or eight minutes, but the bus got hung up on a secondary road by the snow and the slick roads and it was late approximately 20 minutes.'' <PERSON> Steerman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maxson </PERSON> said those aboard the school bus apparently did not aid the three even though they waited in the same car every day at the service station. `` They was supposed to stop and look but the car was steamed up so bad they could n't see in it,'' <PERSON> Maxson </PERSON> said. `` I thought he was asleep,'' <PERSON> Maxson </PERSON> said. `` I beat on the windows ... and tried to get them awake. I shoved the guy and he would n't wake up. I hollered at him and called him by name.'' <PERSON> Steerman </PERSON> said he believed the fatal fumes came from a rusted exhaust pipe. Misty <PERSON> McClain </PERSON> had been adopted earlier this year, authorities said. <PERSON> Steerman </PERSON> said authorities were `` pretty sure'' the deaths were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, and did not know whether an autopsy was planned. <PERSON> Philippi </PERSON>, a town of about 3,100 people, is about 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>.

 An alleged Colombian cocaine dealer has been extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face prosecution in connection with the importation of more than 100 kilograms of cocaine, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, 55, who was indicted on drug charges by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> in October, was turned over by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> authorities at 7 p.m. EST Thursday in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> announced in a statement released here early today. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was immediately flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, arriving in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at 4:15 a.m. EST, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> is the tenth person to be extradited from <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> since August when <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> began a new drive against drug trafficking, and the first since a massive truck bomb exploded in front of the offices of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s federal investigative police Dec. 6, killing at least 35 people and wounding hundreds. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Study: Hair Sample Better Than Urine Sample for Detecting Drug Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tests to detect cocaine use should be done on hair samples as well as urine samples because a hair analysis will detect drug abuse months afterward, a study published today says. But an editorial accompanying the study in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said hair analysis is unreliable and unwieldy. The study said hair sampling can not completely replace urine testing since it wo n't detect cocaine use in `` the recent few days'' as urinalysis does, but hair analysis can uncover whether someone has long used drugs. `` While a urine test may be negative, this hair test will make it very difficult to hide a history of drug use,'' Dr. <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Koren </PERSON>, an author of the study, said in a telephone interview Thursday. <PERSON> Koren </PERSON> and colleagues at The Hospital for Sick Children in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> did an analysis in 1987 of urine and hair samples from 21 healthy adults who reported no cocaine use. They compared results of the test with an analysis of urine and hair samples from seven pregnant admitted cocaine users who got prenatal counseling at the <ORGANIZATION> Motherisk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and nine cocaine addicts from the medical ward at the <ORGANIZATION> Addiction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Urine samples from the groups tested negative. Hair tests for the users, some of whom participated in a treatment program and had quit, reflected that they had once used the drug but later had quit, <PERSON> Koren </PERSON> said. `` If an adult chooses to stop taking the drug several days before the -LRB- urine -RRB- test _ and chooses to tell you that he did n't use the drug _ there is no way you can tell,'' said <PERSON> Koren </PERSON>, an author of the study `` But there is one place in the body where cocaine gets in and does not know how to get out, and that's the hair.'' In the editorial, however, Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> said hair analysis is `` unwieldy for use by most laboratories other than research laboratories.'' He questioned the reliability of hair analysis, saying dyeing or bleaching hair could taint test results, as could exposure to automobile exhaust fumes or other substances that might cause the drugs to deteriorate. `` While, at first glance, this practice may seem to be an efficacious one, it likely will not become standard for some time, if at all,'' he said. <PERSON> Koren </PERSON> said he has heard that hair analysis is being used on the West Coast of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by a firm which does testing for industries. He had no other information and said he had seen no previous studies on the method. In the test, a hair sample is subjected to a chemical process called radioimmunoassay, which reduces it to a solution that can be analyzed for a cocaine derivative. `` Hair grows about 1 centimeter per month, so we can tell if someone stopped the cocaine a couple of months ago _ the new hair near the scalp will not have the cocaine anymore,'' <PERSON> Koren </PERSON> said. He said the researchers' main target was to find a way of determining drug use in pregnant women who do not admit it. `` If there is a baby that looks very sick or has problems that can not be explained by other factors, we can tell with this test,'' he said. `` This means that in the future, if we find cocaine in the hair of a baby, even if the mother does not admit using it, that means she did use it.''

<TEXT>
 A new federal drug law that imposes mandatory prison sentences is drawing complaints from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> judges who say their authority is being undermined. `` I do n't think it's the world's most popular thing with judges,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, chief federal judge for the Northern District of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` We get in this business and over the years presumably develop some educated discretion with respect to disposition of criminal cases, and that just takes discretion away. You have to comply with the statute, but I think many judges wish the statute would be repealed.'' Two weeks ago, the issue came to a boil in the courtroom of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnacke </PERSON>, a former longtime federal prosecutor and 1970 judicial appointee of President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. The case was one where a crack cocaine prosecution in state court, with a maximum 12-year sentence, was transferred by prosecutors to federal court where penalties are stiffer _ in this case, a mandatory life term without parole because of defendant <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s two prior convictions. As jurors prepared to deliberate, <PERSON> Schnacke </PERSON> said he would normally tell them to ignore possible penalties because those were up to him. But since he had no choice of sentence, he said, they should know that a conviction would be punished by life without parole. On Dec. 1, the jury acquitted <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, of the drug charge, convicting him only of a gun-possession charge that has yet to be sentenced. <PERSON> Schnacke </PERSON> thanked the jurors `` for what I take to be an expression of concern about the nature of the compelled sentencing process that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has imposed upon the courts.'' The new federal drug law, effective last November, requires prison sentences without parole for certain types of drug crimes _ decisions that were formerly left up to the sentencing judge. A first offender who possessed over 50 grams of crack cocaine for sale, for example, must serve at least 10 years without parole. With a prior felony drug conviction, the minimum sentence is 20 years, and with two prior drug felonies the mandatory sentence is life without the possibility of parole. `` Mandatory minimum -LRB- sentences -RRB- applied to some kinds of cases result in shocking injustice,'' said federal Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzer </PERSON>. `` Judges are going to struggle to find ways to perform their sworn constitutional duty to do justice.''

 Jurors wept as they heard the testimony of a patient who survived a dose of a paralyzing drug from a hospital nurse, then convicted <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> for causing four deaths. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> stared straight ahead Thursday during the reading of the verdict finding him guilty of murder in two deaths, manslaughter in a third and criminally negligent homicide in a fourth. `` What this guy did to all of these people is beyond words,'' said a sobbing <PERSON> Kieran </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, 24, whose father, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, was one of <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>'s victims. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> hugged prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> after the verdict was announced. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>, 27, faces a maximum of 50 years to life for the murders when sentenced Jan. 17. Less than an hour before the verdict, jurors in the eighth day of deliberations listened to testimony by former patient <PERSON> Gerolamo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON>, a 75-year-old Yugoslavian. `` I was actually putting myself in his shoes,'' juror <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Loguercio </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Kucich </LOCATION>. `` I walked out of there in tears this morning.'' <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON> testified during the trial that while he was a patient <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> had given him an injection saying it would `` make me feel better.'' Instead, <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON> was left fighting for breath. `` This is probably a fair verdict,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Naiburg </PERSON>. The injections, lethal doses of muscle relaxants, occurred at <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samaritan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islip </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the fall of 1987. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>, who was a nurse in the intensive care unit for about six months, admitted to police he had planned to inject the patients, then be first on the scene to revive them and be seen as a hero. The jury also convicted <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> on Thursday of assault charges in the deaths and in the injections he gave <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON>. He was acquitted of assaulting two patients whose deaths were not proved to be from the drugs. <PERSON> Naiburg </PERSON> had conceded in his closing statement that <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> injected the patients and that he may have caused some of their deaths. But he had argued that <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> was not aware that the injections presented a grave risk to the patients, a condition necessary for a murder conviction. He had urged the jurors to find <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> guilty of criminally negligent homicide, a lesser charge punishable by up to four years in jail. The prosecutor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, calling <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> `` a monster in nurse's whites,'' had argued that <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> had to know the risks involved, especially after the first victim died. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials exhumed 33 bodies of patients at Good Samaritan who died suspiciously during <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>'s tenure. The medical examiner found traces of Pavulon in six of the bodies exhumed. A Pavulon-laced syringe was found in <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>'s apartment the day before his arrest. County Court Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> remanded <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> without bail Thursday to the county jail, where he has been held since his arrest.

<TEXT>
 Authorities imposed an curfew here today to prevent Moslem separatists from celebrating the government's decision to free five jailed militants in ransom deal The government released the five to secure the freedom of a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister's daughter held captive by Moslem militants for six days. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, new Prime Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> met with reporters for the first time as chief of state and defended his decision to release the militants. `` We are not bowing to terrorists. We saw the overall situation and took the decision,'' said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who assumed power earlier this month, succeeding <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said the government would review the situation in the northern state of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION>, where militant Moslems are finding increasing support for their campaign to secede from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. `` We will assess the situation but are not in favor of precipitate action because it is a delicate situation,'' he said. `` There are a lot of problems at the people's level. We have to tackle it in a very deft way with a lot of flexibility.'' <PERSON> S.S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, deputy inspector general of police in <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state, said security forces had orders to shoot curfew violators. Witnesses said police fired at a group of people who tried to defy curfew in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, home of 700,000 people and the summer capital of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state. But they did not know if there were any casualties. About 150 soldiers were called out in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, and two armored personnel carriers were stationed at the city's main intersection, witnesses said. Paramiliitary troops from the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> also were deployed in the towns of <LOCATION> Anantnag </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baramulla </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Anantnag </LOCATION>, Moslem militants fired at a police patrol and injured one policeman, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said. Police returned fire, injuring six of the attackers. The jailed militants, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, were released Wednesday in exchange for <PERSON> Rubaiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, a medical intern and the daughter of Home Minister <PERSON> Mufti </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, a Moslem and a Kashmiri. Ms. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, 22, was kidnapped on Dec. 8, and her release came after five days of hectic negotiations with the abductors who twice threatened to kill her. The swap sparked celebtations in the Moslem-majority state and large groups of people shouted anti-India slogans and waved the national flag of neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The militants have been demanding the secession of the state from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and gaining either autonomy of assimilation into <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` We fear that the terrorists may try to create lots of disturbance, hence we have taken the steps,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s only Moslem majority state. Moslems make up 64 percent of the state's 5 million people, but only about 11 percent of the country's 880 million people. The <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, formed in 1965, advocates secession of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> to become either independent or part of <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> is claimed by both <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and the two countries have fought three wars over the territory since gaining independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. A ceasefire line mointored by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> separates the state into Indian and Pakistani territory. On Thursday, two teen-age boys were killed when security forces fired on rampaging Moslems separatists in <LOCATION> Sapore </LOCATION> town. Moslems mobs attacked a police station and freed some prisoners. Trouble spread to the neighboring town of <LOCATION> Baramullah </LOCATION>, where violent mobs attacked an army motor convoy, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said. An 18-year-old boy, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON>, was killed when soldiers opened fire on the crowd in self-defense, he said. Curfew was imposed in both towns Thursday. Both towns are about 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> is the first Moslem to be named to the sensitive post that oversees police and internal security. The appointment on Dec. 5 was seen as part of the Singh's efforts to appease <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Moslem minority who have borne the brunt of Hindu-Moslem religious riots this fall that claimed 300 lives.

<HEAD>State Drops $100 Million Santa Monica Bay Pollution Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state water agency dropped its $ 100 million lawsuit against the city in exchange for municipal promises to spend even more to cut the flow of pollution into once pristine <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The bay fronting some of the world's most-visited beaches has provided background scenery to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> productions, including the `` Beach Blanket'' movies, `` Gidget'' TV series and the film `` Tequila Sunrise.'' It touches about 40 miles of wide, white-sand beach from the <LOCATION> Palos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verdes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in the south to <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> in the north. The agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the city of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> lists 22 measures the city must pursue, with costs estimated to surpass $ 100 million, officials said Thursday. `` This is the way controversies between two government agencies should be handled,'' Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. `` Instead of fighting it out in the courts, we solved it at the bargaining table.'' The city agreed to take steps to prevent raw sewage spills at a treatment plant, reduce pollutants washing out to sea from storm drains and improve sewage treatment. A rash of sewage spills in 1987 prompted county health officials to close miles of beach, angering surfers, scuba divers and environmentalists. The city also pledged to create new water reclamation and conservation programs and stage a museum exhibit to heighten public awareness on bay pollution. The pact was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in a closed-door meeting Tuesday and announced on Thursday. Virtually all costs will be borne by the city's sewage surcharge tax imposed on homeowners and commercial landlords, city officials said. State Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> filed the suit in 1987, seeking penalties of up to $ 20 a gallon for two major spills that dumped more than 5.4 million gallons of raw sewage into the bay.

<HEAD>Plan for More Smog-Free Cars Approved in California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has approved a plan that could lead to widescale use of alternative fuels in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vehicles after 1997. The proposed requirements _ would have major implications for auto makers and oil companies, as well as for consumers _ go far beyond 1994 emission limits for conventional gasoline-powered cars that were adopted in June. The new regulations would probably require use of such fuels as methanol, compressed natural gas and electricity. New emission control technologies would also be required. `` This is the first time we've started to wean people away from gasoline and cars as we know them,'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessa </PERSON> said Thursday. The limits were contained in a board staff proposal that would have to be approved by the board next September. Without a new generation of motor vehicles, the board said, <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> air will not be able to meet federal clean air standards. Beginning in 1997, one out of every four cars sold in the state would have to emit 70 percent fewer hydrocarbons than required by the 1994 standard, under the proposal. By 1998, half of all cars sold would be required to meet the tougher standard. In effect, this would mean two tailpipe standards _ one for conventional gasoline cars, based on the 1994 standard, and another for so-called `` low-emission cars,'' which the state would require to be sold in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The 1997 standard limits hydrocarbon emissions to 0.075 grams per mile. The 1994 standard limits them to 0.25 grams per mile. Federal standards now set hydrocarbon limits at 0.41 grams per mile. Over time, the market share of low-emission cars would grow from less than 10 percent in 1994 to 100 percent of new cars sold in the year 2000, officials said. Oil companies would be required to sell alternative fuels at their service stations as a condition for continuing to sell gasoline in the state. Automobile makers would be required to make the lower-emission vehicles in order to meet the tougher standards. Industry representatives said the proposed timetable was unrealistically fast and may not be technologically feasible. The Air Quality Management District, which regulates air quality in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, said that next year it will consider a rule requiring operators of fleets of more than 15 vehicles to begin purchasing alternative, cleaner-fueled vehicles. The district's goal is to have 40 percent of all cars, 70 percent of all trucks and 100 percent of buses running on cleaner fuels by 2000.

 A teen-ager who claimed he was beaten and robbed while tending a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> kettle has admitted he took the money and fabricated the story, authorities said. The 17-year-old took the money Dec. 4 and spent some of it on taxi fare and a ticket to a rock concert two days later, police said. `` It breaks your heart and kind of takes some of the spirit out of Christmas,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartsook </PERSON>, area manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's theft any way you look at it.'' <PERSON> Hartsook </PERSON> said the boy also spent some of the money on a coat. `` He did a stupid thing. All he had to do was call me and say, ` Hey, Captain, I need a coat.' I could have helped,'' <PERSON> Hartsook </PERSON> said. The boy admitted to fabricating the story when detectives questioned him Thursday, police said. Detective Capt. R.E. <PERSON> Bingman </PERSON> said charges are pending. The youngster's name was being withheld because he is a juvenile. Police said they received a tip from someone who said the boy was seen exchanging a large number of coins for paper money. <PERSON> Hartsook </PERSON> said the boy apologized and agreed to make restitution, but `` he'll never work for the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> again.'' He also said he hoped the incident would not deter people from donating to the organization's traditional Christmas fund-raising drive.

<HEAD>AIDS Tests to be Done on NYC Autopsies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Every autopsy at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> medical examiner's office will include an AIDS test in an effort to inform other people if they may be infected with the virus, according to a published report today. The test results will be used in statistical research and in `` contact-tracing,'' the tracking of an AIDS sufferer's sexual partners or drug-needle sharers, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said they were unaware of any other such program in the country. About 8,000 autopsies are performed every year by the medical examiner's office. Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, the chief medical examiner, said he expected to detect the AIDS virus in about 1,000 of the autopsies. The testing has been approved by Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and was authorized Monday by the medical examiner's advisory board. The results and the names of people who have been contacted will be kept confidential. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> said testing would begin by year's end after he discussed the program with groups involved with AIDS issues. Some people have expressed concern that contact-tracing may lead to invasion of privacy. But <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, the city's health commissioner, denied that. `` What argument can anyone make to not warn the unsuspecting partner of someone who is dead?'' he said. `` It's very compelling _ the absolute need to warn people at risk who might not learn any other way.'' He said the program will be useful in evaluating the extent of the virus's spread in the city and be an `` extremely useful tool for epidemiologic control and prevention.'' There are 75,000 deaths every year in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Autopsies are carried out for unusual or unexplained deaths, and are required in homicides, suicides and deaths from drug overdose. Many of those who die for unexplained reasons are believed to carry the AIDS virus, particularly intravenous drug users.

We could agree or disagree with him, but he was a man of absolute sincerity and absolute purity, and this led him to achievements in sicence and his position in public life.'' The course of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s independent group of delegates, the 400-member <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, was unclear. A strike that <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> tried to organize Monday had fizzled, and deputies outvoted the independents to cut off debate on possibly changing an article of the Soviet Constitution that guaranteed the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s role as the leading force in society. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and historian <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> said in an emotional three-hour meeting Thursday that it was time to call for a multiparty democratic system. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said Thursday that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership were `` leading the country to catastrophe, prolonging the process of perestroika many years.'' Thursday's meeting came as the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began dissecting the government's blueprint for economic reform, with progressives complaining that it was not daring enough to improve the country's grim financial condition Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> announced Wednesday that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> believes it can revive the economy without resorting to such radical moves as legalization of private property and selling off money-losing state enterprises. Progressives in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reacted with scorn to <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>'s speech, which promised five more years of bureaucratic control of such mundane details of life as the number of eggs produced per person. The government proposal does shift the emphasis of traditional central planning away from heavy industry to consumer goods and services. Such enterprises are to quadruple in the next five-year plan, from 1991-1996.

<HEAD>Robert Morse Plays Truman Capote on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 5 grafs with other critics' reviews. No pickup. No PMs
planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Underneath all the celebrity, writer <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Capote </PERSON> was a melancholy, lonely little man. That's one of the points playwright <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Presson </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> makes with surprising poignancy in `` Tru,'' her terrific one-man show based on the life of the well-known literary personality. The play, which opened Thursday night at Broadway's Booth Theater, examines a specific, highly publicized life, but its lessons are universal. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> takes the man and makes his plight moving. Capote, defeated by too much high and low life, becomes the victim of his success. Or rather the success he has ca n't compensate for the rejection he feels from family, friends, lovers and a fickle public In the play, the pudgy, pint-sized Capote prowls his plush apartment at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION>. He tattles on the telephone in search of `` a dirt fix,'' talks into a tape recorder for a biographer and eventually ends up speaking directly to the audience about his strange, unhappy life. The show takes place in the week before Christmas 1975. It's a momentous time for Capote, just after <ORGANIZATION> Esquire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> published an excerpt from his novel-in-progress `` Answered Prayers.'' In it, Capote savages some of his rich, female friends, such people as <PERSON> Babe </PERSON> <PERSON> Paley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>. Much to his surprise and anger, they cut him off. `` You'd think I killed the <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON> baby,'' he whines. Capote proclaims himself an artist, and a true artist has no friends, he says. But the man still craves the acceptance of these people. Their abandonment hurts him just as much as when his own mother left him as a child with her sisters in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. There are some sweet remembrances of that time, including a reading from `` A Christmas Memory,'' a heart-breaking holiday story about his childhood and his favorite aunt. Capote is played with astonishing fidelity by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>. The actor, best known as a brash musical comedy performer, is a revelation, and not only because of <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Haney </PERSON>'s remarkable makeup which transforms him into a credible likeness of Capote. His Capote is wickedly funny, a sly imp ready to deliver an off-color joke about the Queen Mum, zing <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulet </PERSON> or rhapsodize about the time he tap-danced for <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. His voice is soft and sibilant, his body language languid, except when he dives into a dance, bopping to `` The Girl From <LOCATION> Ipanema </LOCATION>.'' But there's a desperate side to Capote, too, and <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> rises to the pain. The playwright conjures up a devastating moment in Act 2 when <PERSON> Capote </PERSON> puts his fist through a portrait of himself as a young man, a beautiful golden boy who let his life fall apart. It earns gasps from the audience. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> deftly weaves biographical facts into the evening, refusing to present <PERSON> Capote </PERSON> as merely a case study. The production, which the playwright also directed, rarely falters as it builds to the loneliest of Christmas Eves. The luxurious apartment designed by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> offers an appropriately panoramic view of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the gaudy furnishings include Capote's own sofa lent by <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>. It's an opulent, colorful setting, the perfect environment for <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s extravagant, colorful subject. But Capote, who died in 1984, probably would have been interesting wherever he was and so is the play. `` Tru'' is an affecting portrait of a gifted but peculiar writer, whose saddest story turned out to be his own. Broadway critics praised <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> in the one-man show. They also applauded <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> but wished that he had delved deeper into Capote's persona <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>'s performance a tour de force and said that with the <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s help, <PERSON> Capote </PERSON> `` really does live again.'' The Daily News' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> `` captures both -LRB- Capote's -RRB- wit and malice beautifully,'' and that <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>'s work is `` sheer joy.'' `` It is a shock, not to mention a pleasure and delight, to stumble on Capote's ghost in the unlikely person of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Winer </PERSON> in today's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION>. But she said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> unfortunately does not touch the mysteries of what made Capote a great writer, when he was up to it. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, wishing for a stronger play, said `` in place of a life portrait with depth, ` Tru' settles for its wind-up Madame Tussauds's caricature of the wrecked 1975 model Capote.'' And while applauding <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>'s efforts, he said his performances leaves one eager to see him in other works.

 A <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producer charged with soliciting children for sex fled from a courthouse after learning he was about to be arrested on a second, similar complaint, his lawyer said.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 French troops landed today on the <LOCATION> Comoros </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, taking control of the country's security in what the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> called a military mission requested by the <ORGANIZATION> Comoros </ORGANIZATION> government. Four hours later, French mercenary <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> and about 25 other European soldiers of fortune who trained and led the 600-member Comoran Presidential Guard boarded a South African military plane and left for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, Agence France-Presse reported. No violence was reported during the French operation. The French government said earlier that the mercenaries had offered to relinquish control of the country, but it was unclear whether an agreement was reached and if so, what terms were offered. A military spokesman said the soldiers came from the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Mayotte </LOCATION>, 185 miles away, under a `` defense cooperation agreement between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the Comoros.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> once controlled the <LOCATION> Comoros </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Both President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevenement </PERSON> had stressed earlier this week that there would be no French military intervention in the Comoros. The islands off southeast African have been in turmoil since the Nov. 26 assassination of President <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON>. AFP, the French news agency, said from Comoran capital, <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION>, that 50 French paratroopers in helicopters landed to take over control of the archipelago from the Presidential Guard. They were followed by two transport planes full of troops. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> and the Presidential Guard had been in control of the islands since the president's assassination. At one end of the runway, 250 men of the Presidential Guard stood at attention along with <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> dressed in civilian clothes, awaiting the change of control, AFP reported. About 25 of the French troops, accompanied by the French military attache in <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION>, approached <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> and his men and, after a brief conversation, the chief mercenary left the area, <ORGANIZATION> AFP </ORGANIZATION> said. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> AFP </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> was willing to relinquish control if the safety of his men was guaranteed and if he and his fellow mercenaries were given an unspecified payment. It was unclear if those demands were honored. The <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said South African officials planned to issue <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> a temporary residence permit on condition he agreed to leave within a month. Most Comorans believe <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> and his mercenaries, who first put <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> into power in 1978, were responsible for his death. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> has denied killing the president, but he admitted during a news conference that he was in the room when the shooting occurred. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, a veteran soldier of fortune in several <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and African conflicts, claimed that <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> was shot accidentally by a bodyguard. Six French and Belgian mercenaries left <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION> on Thursday night on the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> flight for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, accompanied by wives and other family members, AFP reported. They rest left today, the agency said. The intervention by the French, the former colonial power, `` a matter of an express request by the Comoran authorities,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` It is a takeover from the Presidential Guard.'' Both <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the biggest aid suppliers to the Comoros, had cut off assistance and were putting strong pressure on <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> and his men to leave. Negotiations had been going on for the past several days.

 In another concession to pro-democracy groups, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said today it will disband the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia, further weakening the party's grip on power. The announcement came a day after the government abolished the hated secret police, often used to suppress any signs of dissent. Pro-democracy activists had demanded the breakup of both the militia and the secret police as the country moves toward free elections in May. The militia, once armed with anti-aircraft guns, automatic weapons, armored personnel carriers and rocket-propelled grenades, acted as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s own army. In a brief dispatch, the state <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Communist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>'s government had agreed on an `` end to the work of the militia,'' which it said would be completed by the end of June 1990. According to Western estimates, the militia numbers 3,000 active members, but it is believed that 400,000 could be called up on short notice. The government already has begun disarming the militia, which was put on alert to help crush the pro-democracy protests in October. There were some reports that the militia had been put into action then. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Communists have made increasing concessions to the opposition since hard-line leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s ouster on Oct. 18. The leadership has promised to separate government and Communist Party functions. The Communist nation has also established its first contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> as it breaks with the isolation of the past. On Thursday, the leadership welcomed wide-ranging economic cooperation with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and earlier this week it expressed interest in closer ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, in an interview published today, said that `` closer ties between the two German states contribute to stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> also said that East Germans will have a chance to decide between a socialist or free-market system in elections planned in the spring, and `` we will respect'' their decision, according to the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgen </ORGANIZATION>. `` We remain a single nation,'' the <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said. He envisaged the two German states growing together within a general process of overcoming the postwar division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a `` demilitarization of East-West relations.'' Late Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said East German envoy <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietze </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Junz </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>'s special trade representative. ADN called Thursday's session in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> the `` first contacts'' between the two sides, saying <PERSON> Dietze </PERSON> had expressed interest in the `` economic, monetary, political and financial experience'' of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. `` The contacts are expected to be continued,'' said ADN. But it did not say whether <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will seek membership in the international organization. A day earlier, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> said it and the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> had agreed on a package of economic reforms and credit that is expected to stimulate a flow of Western support for the East European nation. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, with headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, promotes monetary cooperation, currency stabilization and trade expansion. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> named <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as one of the Eastern European countries that could qualify for Western financial aid, if <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> seeks to adopt free-market principles. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been showing greater interest in developing its foreign trade, as demonstrated by the visit of West German Economics Minister <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> met with Communist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, and the two sides agreed to set up a joint economic commission and broaden cooperation. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is seeking to attract more Western capital, while there are numerous signs of change on the diplomatic level as well. After meeting with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> said that he looked forward to broader scientific and cultural ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in addition to more economic links. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is the highest-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official to visit <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in nearly two decades. The sides established diplomatic relations in 1974. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> said he saw clear signs of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the current democratic and economic reform process under way in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. All of the openings amount to a virtual revolution for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which as late as August was defending the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall as an `` anti-fascist protection wall'' against plundering from an allegedly greedy West.

 A foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl carrying a beeper was arrested trying to sell crack, police said. `` As soon as she opened her mouth ... she called us every name in the book,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The girl `` looked like any 11-year-old girl, baby-faced, wearing sneakers,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s chief law officer today announced the first public inquiry into the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, which exploded over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and killed 270 people. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, the Lord Advocate, said criminal prosecution was not imminent but that he still hoped to find the terrorists who planted the bomb in a suitcase that brought down the flight on Dec. 21, 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, packed with Christmas travelers heading to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, exploded over the Scottish town of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground. Investigators displayed pictures at a news conference today showing how they had reconstructed the part of the plane where the explosion occurred, with a gaping hole in the forward cargo section. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> said aircraft often are reconstructed but that this represented `` quite an achievement'' because it involved many small pieces scattered over a large area. Police had said earlier they had recovered 85 percent of the aircraft. In a statement released at the news conference, <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said the fatal accident inquiry _ similar to a coroner's inquest _ will be held next year but that a date and place had not been set. The inquiry's scope will include whether `` reasonable precautions'' might have avoided the tragedy and possible `` defects'' in any system that might have contributed to the deaths, <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said. He said the announcment was made today to give authorities time to organize the inquiry and notify people, and that it had nothing to do with the first anniversary of the crash next week. Fatal accident inquiries are conducted by a sheriff sitting without a jury. The sheriff will issue a finding on the evidence. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said the inquiry would have power under Scottish law to order foreign evidence, although it could not request people overseas to appear. Relatives of the victims are entitled to attend or be represented. Investigators remain determined `` to bring the evil perpetrators of this mass murder to justice,'' <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said. `` This appalling terrorist outrage ... was an affront ... to civilized people everywhere.'' There are two investigations already under way in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the criminal probe headed by the <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> <PERSON> Constabulary </PERSON> and a crash probe by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>'s Air Accident Investigation branch. Neither of those investigations are being held in public. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Esson </PERSON>, chief of the constabulary, said his investigation had focused on the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PFLP-GC </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist Palestinian group headed by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>. `` It would be right to say that we have focused our attention on one group, but it would be unwise to rule out other possibilities,'' he said. Asked whether that group was the <ORGANIZATION> PFLP-GC </ORGANIZATION>, he said: `` Certainly.'' Investigators have said a bomb made of plastic explosive was packed in a <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> radio-cassette player and hidden in a suitcase, which was loaded into a forward cargo hold. They displayed a photo today showing the reconstructed metal container which held the suitcase bomb. <PERSON> Esson </PERSON> said Scottish investigators still believe the suitcase bomb `` either started or passed through the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport,'' where the flight originated. West German police maintain there is not enough evidence to prove that. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Esson </PERSON> were asked about <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>, a member of another radical Palestinian group who is charged in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> with four bombings in northern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He was identified in a Swedish court as a suspect in the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> bombing and police seized clothing from his home, reportedly to compare with shreds of clothing found in the wreckage. `` I have at present no intention to seek the extradition of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Esson </PERSON> said: `` He is certainly an individual in whom we have an interest.'' He added that investigators wanted to talk with many people, but he refused to identify them further. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, asked about the contents of the baggage that contained the bomb, said investigators also had found `` items of clothing which have been further identified and located.'' He refused to elaborate. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> denied that he was pessimistic about prosecutions and said investigators had made `` impressive'' progress aided by outstanding forensic work and unprecedented international cooperation. `` What we are doing in effect is trying to piece together an international terrorist jigsaw,'' <PERSON> Esson </PERSON> said. `` We have some of the pieces, some we are trying to place, and some we have yet to find.''

 <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the brilliant physicist who built the Soviet hydrogen bomb and became an unwavering beacon for the world in the cause of human rights, has died at age 68. The 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner died alone in his study Thursday night of an apparent heart attack, said his son-in-law, <PERSON> Yefrem </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> died as he had lived the last two decades of his life, struggling for democracy, world peace and human liberty. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who freed <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> from nearly seven years of internal exile but clashed with him repeatedly over the scale and speed of new Soviet political reforms, mourned the death as `` a great loss.'' `` He was a man of conviction and sincerity,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` He was not some sort of political intriguer. He was a person who had his own ideas, his own convictions which he expressed openly and directly. This does n't mean I agreed with him, although on many things we did agree.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> risked his status as a national scientific hero and the honors the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had heaped upon him to openly challenge the government when most others were silent. He was vilified, attacked by the authorities and banished from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1980. The exile sapped his vitality and undermined his health. After he was freed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> three years ago, he won a seat in the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He used it as a forum to press for reform and freedom in his country, gaining new stature as a conscience of the nation. Tributes to the brave humanist came from around the world. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s death occurred after a long day of struggle to organize an opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He was preparing a speech demanding that the Communists' guaranteed hold on power be revoked, <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON> said. The defiant activist's final words to his family were: `` Tomorrow there will be battle,'' <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovalev </PERSON>, a fellow human rights activist in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and a friend, said the body was found by <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> was his full partner in their human rights campaigns that embraced any cause, fought any injustice and gave strength and courage to victims and to those who wanted to reform the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, his strength and his companion during the years of struggle and exile, sat in a chair next to the body. A few close friends were admitted to the apartment, said a friend who spoke on condition he not be identified. Just hours before he died, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> stood on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and demanded that opposition delegates form an alternative party to the Communists. He told his fellow opposition congressmen that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership were `` leading the country to catastrophe, prolonging the process of perestroika many years.'' It was the latest call in his final cause: to end seven decades of guaranteed Communist supremacy. The 2,250-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> formed a committee to organize <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s funeral, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he and the entire body will attend. At his own request, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> will be buried alongside his parents Monday at <LOCATION> Vostryakovskoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> on the southwestern edge of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said a scientific secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Lebedev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> worked. <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON>, a member of the Presidium of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, opened today's session with an announcement of the death of one of the chamber's best-known deputies, a man who was officially vilified for decades. He paid tribute to <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> both as a scientist and public figure. `` All that he did was dictated by his sleepless conscience, his deep humanitarian convictions,'' said <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> and president of the Russian Federation. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in standing for a moment of silence out of respect for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> member. <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON>, another scholar-deputy, told the chamber: `` With <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, a part of our heart has departed from us.'' <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON> told reporters at the apartment that his father-in-law `` died last night of what the doctors say was a heart attack. We do n't exactly know the cause of death yet.'' <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had left his apartment about 9 p.m. to go downstairs to another apartment in the same building, where he had a study crammed with books and papers from his scientific and political careers.

 <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had suffered from angina, but during a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in December 1988, doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> determined he did not need heart surgery or a pacemaker after cardiovascular tests. He had aged visibly in recent months, which were busy with international speaking trips and his work as a member of the new, competitively elected <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A White House statement today hailed <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> as a historic figure whose voice `` was an important dimension in the contemporary changes under way in Soviet society.'' Human rights activist <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, who spent nine years in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> labor camps before immigrating to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1986, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> today that <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> `` had tremendous influence ... among dissidents, among free people in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and who by his own personal example helped change the whole climate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> unanimously paid tribute today to <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, whose name it had given to its Human Rights Prize. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, attending a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, said: `` He was a tremendous force for peace and freedom.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> formed a committee to organize <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s funeral, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. It was a reflection of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s trek from his years as a lonely voice opposed to Kremlin policies to again becoming a honored member of society. Born May 21, 1921, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s first became known as a great scientist, inducted into the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in 1953 at age 32, the youngest-ever member. Like his father, he became a physicist. In 1948, he joined physicist <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamm </PERSON> in developing the hydrogen bomb and for 20 years lived and worked in secrecy, with privileges that included a good apartment, driver, high salary and government awards. But <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> began to worry about the morality of developing weapons of mass destruction. He had his first brush with top Soviet officials in 1961, when he appealed to Premier <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> to stop nuclear weapons tests. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> responded that scientists should n't meddle in politics. Two years later, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to such limits in a treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. After <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> formed the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1970, he became better known as a dissident leader, clashing with four <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> leaderships over human rights, foreign policy and the morality of the nuclear weaponry he helped create. As an emerging dissident, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> appeared to be immune to official sanctions while other prominent dissidents were forced to emigrate or sent to labor camps. But in 1973, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was warned by authorities that his interviews and statements were used by the foreign press for anti-Soviet slander and that he should be aware of the consequences. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> continued to speak out, and he and his wife attended the trials of prominent dissidents and lent their names to international appeals for prisoners of conscience in all countries to be freed. The physicist's tireless campaigns on behalf of disarmament and human rights won him the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, and he steadfastly argued that without international respect for human rights there could be no guarantee of peace. He was stripped of his Soviet awards after he criticized the 1979 Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and then-Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> banished him in January 1980 to <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>, 200 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was never charged with any crime or put on trial. Reporters, foreign visitors and diplomats who knew <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> described him as a modest man of patience and humor but determined once his ire was aroused. He was released in December 1986 and recalled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He swiftly took a leading role in urging the Soviet leader to follow through on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s twin policies of perestroika, or restructuring, and glasnost, or openness. He was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies this year, completing a remarkable comeback. In June, he told the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he had no regrets. `` I am proud of this exile in Gorky like a medal I wear.''

<TEXT>
 The crumbling of communist rule in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is prompting some to proclaim that history, at least in terms of ideological struggle, is over and the championship belt goes to democratic capitalism. Not so fast, say dissenters on the left. History is not over by a long shot. Do n't count Marxism out just yet. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, longtime <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Communist Party leader <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> yearns for the good old days when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was less inclined toward revisionist thought. Hall was so incensed at the irreverent views of a leading Soviet reform organ, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News, that he urged his allies in the birthplace of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> to have the editor removed. Otherwise, said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, they could `` burn down the god-damn building. I mean get rid of it.'' As <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> sees it, the interests of class struggle preclude capitalism's right to exist. Hall also had no patience with pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, finding them entirely too pro-American. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s views may seem increasingly quaint in a world where Marxists increasingly are on the defensive, but the far left does not give up easily. In this hemisphere, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> still boasts a devout following among some of his countrymen and the leftist cause continues to persuade many in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to take up arms. Do n't tell the Salvadoran rebels that democratic capitalists are on the side of history. They see around them all the evils that <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> spoke of: exploitation, class stratification, disease, unemployment and illiteracy. To these combatants, there is considerable allure to a philosophy _ socialism _ which `` guarantees'' equality and the right to health care, education and employment. The Salvadoran militants do n't want to hear about the hundreds of thousands who have been demonstrating in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> for the past two months demanding an end to 40 years of misrule. They want an end to more than a century and a half of misrule in their own country. Obviously there are many in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> who believe that a rebel-led government would only make things worse. And do n't tell the hard-liners within <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leadership about the wonders of democratic capitalism. Most of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has lived under elected civilian governments for the past decade, a period marked by one of the steepest economic declines in the region's history.

Perhaps the most irrepressible defender of the Marxist faith these days is <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who believes someone must stand up for the `` thousands of millions of people in the world who live in inhuman conditions.'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> blames this state of affairs on the `` colossal looting'' of imperialist countries, led by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Do n't talk to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> about the more than 200,000 East Germans who have fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year.

Standing before a gathering of his countrymen last week, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> warned of the dangers of reverting to capitalist rule: `` prostitution, drugs, gambling, begging, unemployment, abysmal inequality between citizens ... `` He believes communism is too young a philosophy to give up on, especially when one considers the alternative. This notion, of course, is being rejected by millions of East Europeans who believe it is farfetched to suggest the flaws of Marxism can be corrected, as <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> suggests, with mere fine tuning.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Jury Can Split Lottery Winnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was a case in which the judge had to read the jury its rights _ rights to the $ 1,000 prize from a lottery ticket that came with lunch. The panel, deliberating in a product liability case, was n't sure if it could keep the cash because the government paid for the lunch. So jurors asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Crabb </PERSON>, who was presiding over the trial. Bailiff <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Crabb </PERSON> laughed and said to instruct the jury that nothing could be done with the ticket until they decided the case being tried. The lunches, which <PERSON> Bowe </PERSON> picked up at a delicatessan, included four `` Instant Cash Match'' tickets as a promotion, and when a juror scratched the tickets, one was a $ 1,000 winner. The eight jurors asked to split the prize and on Wednesday, after the case was settled, the judge agreed. She said she relied on the motion picture `` Miracle on 34th Street'' and Christmas spirit for precedent. `` The bailiff gave the jury four unnegotiated tickets which in that state had a negligible value,'' the judge wrote in a decision that had the density if not the weight of an actual judicial ruling. `` Since there was nothing improper about giving uncashed tickets of trivial value to the jury, there is no basis for either the bailiff or the government to try to reassert ownership of the tickets or their proceeds. `` We need not decide which of the jurors has any greater claim to the prize ticket over any of the others. In the best spirit of a jury, the jurors have agreed to share equally in any prize money to which they may be entitled.''

 Someone has given Lt. Gov.

She said the gavel has been missing since legislators left <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> earlier this week after wrapping up the session on workers' compensation revisions. `` I mean, we operate on the honors system here,'' she said. `` It's kind of understood that you do n't make off with the paintings on the wall, you do n't take the bronze busts and you do n't steal the gavel.'' The oak gavel, made by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prison inmates, is nearly 2 feet long and weighs about 4 pounds. `` It does n't have much monetary value,'' <PERSON> Tiede </PERSON> said. `` However, it has a lot of sentimental value at this point.

It would have been easy for someone to slip in and take it.'' State Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who opposed the workers' compensation legislation proposed by Hobby, suggested that it was `` was probably stolen by a representative of the insurance industry who wants to enshrine it as a holy object.''

 More than 11,000 Vietnamese refugees who may be forced to return to their homeland held protest marches for a third day today and burned an effigy of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s governor said no more boat people will be sent home against their will before Christmas. Refugees in six camps around this British colony took part in today's demonstrations, which have widened in scope daily since the forced repatriation of 51 boat people on Tuesday. The protesters are among about 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed into <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> since June 1988 and are considered illegal `` economic migrants'' unless they can prove they fled their Communist homeland fearing persecution. Nearly 6,800 have been denied refugee status after being screened by immigration officials and face repatriation, compared with slightly more than 700 who have qualified for overseas resettlement. Although the protests have been peaceful, about 100 Vietnamese late Thursday attacked a prison officer with iron bars as he investigated a crowd gathering inside the Chi Ma Wan camp. The officer suffered minor injuries. Today, about 4,000 boat people marched inside the <ORGANIZATION> Whitehead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in the New Territories. About 2,500 others chanted slogans as they marched between huts in the <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> reception center next to a rural park, the government said. About 550 boat people staged a sit-in at <ORGANIZATION> Sek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in the New Territories, 3,000 others participated in the third day of protest marches at <ORGANIZATION> Hei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chau </ORGANIZATION> camp on an outlying island, and 1,000 Vietnamese demonstrated at <ORGANIZATION> Sham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Po </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in urban <LOCATION> Kowloon </LOCATION>. A few hundred protested at <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wan </LOCATION>. An effigy of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who has strongly defended the forced repatriation program by this British colony, was burned at the Sham Shui Po protest, a government spokesman said. Governor Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said today that more Vietnamese will be sent back against their will but: `` We have n't got a flight plan before Christmas.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> acknowledged the program has led to widespread international criticism, saying: `` We certainly face the fact there has been a very emotional reaction against what we've done.'' But he added that none of the critics has put forth a viable alternative to solve the problem posed by the massive influx of boat people. Journalists have not been allowed inside the detention centers in recent weeks, but relief agencies say the atmosphere is tense. `` I think the feeling is that there is a great deal of tension in the camps,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Campion </PERSON> of Refugee Concern <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, an advocacy group for the boat people. `` Whether that is going to spill out or explode remains to be seen.'' About 56,000 Vietnamese are housed in squalid camps in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, but only 4,500 refugees have been resettled so far this year. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> argues returning the refugees home is more humane than keeping them indefinitely in crowded centers that are rife with violence and disease. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has condemned the forced repatriation. The approximately 12,000 boat people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> who arrived before June 1988 are considered refugees eligible for resettlement.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers today endorsed a plan to allow unarmed military jets from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> bloc countries to fly over their territory as part of efforts to further reduce East-West military tensions. The endorsement ended two days of talks and followed the announcement of a a historic visit by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Tuesday, the first ever by a Soviet foreign minister. The ministers proposed that the overflights include <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Larger countries would allow several flights a month. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> position will be presented to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> negotiators at a conference in February in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. Plans for the Soviet visit overshadowed the opening day of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> talks, during which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> outlined plans for shaping a wider political role for the alliance in an era of reduced tensions. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> told reporters that during the Soviet visit the two sides will discuss `` matters of common interest. This is a first contact.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in a separate news conference, quipped, `` I do n't see it paving the way for Soviet membership in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said he doubted he would make a similar visit to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact because the Soviet-led alliance has no exact counterpart to <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will be in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Monday and Tuesday to sign a new trade and economic cooperation agreement with the 12-nation European Community. In their final statement, the ministers welcomed the political and economic reforms under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and urged that `` the progress achieved must be consolidated. `` Many problems remain,'' they said. `` The rule of law and democratic government through free elections have yet to be fully institutionalized.'' There was no alternative, they said, to the alliance's strategy of deterrence to prevent war, based on a mix of conventional and nuclear weapons. Opening <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> skies to unarmed <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact planes was first proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the spring. `` The willingness of a country to be overflown is, in itself, a highly significant political act in that it demonstrates its availability to openness,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ministers said. `` Aerial inspection also represents a particularly effective means of verification'' of arms control agreements. Under the plan, countries would be assigned quotas, based on their geographic size, limiting the number of observation flights by unarmed, fixed-wing aircraft. The duration of flights would also be limited. The ministers gave their backing to the eventual reunification of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but through peaceful and democratic means. The language was identifical to that included in a statement issued over the weekend by leaders of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> at a summit in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. They reiterated the importance of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> as an `` indispensable foundation of stability, security and cooperation for the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The ministers said the surveillance could be used in making sure countries comply with the conventional arms agreement being negotiated in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. They also renewed their commitment to reach an agreement this year on reducing tanks, armored personnel carriers and other military hardware in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On Thursday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> sketched his ideas for a broader political role for the alliance. He foresees <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> as a permanent monitor of the reductions being negotiated in conventional, or non-nuclear, arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and as a mediator of regional conflicts.

 A former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent accused of corruption, drug dealing and money laundering has been granted $ 1 million bail, but if he posts it he must stay under house arrest. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatter </PERSON> set bail Thursday over the objections of prosecutors who maintained that former <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was a risk to flee. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION>, could be released as soon as next week from the downtown federal Metropolitan Detention Center. He has been in custody since his Nov. 22, 1988 arrest. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and two other former <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents, <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 42, of Rancho <PERSON> Palos </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdes </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Countryman </PERSON>, 46, of Walnut, were charged in a 42-count indictment with trafficking cocaine and heroin and laundering the proceeds through banks in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, 41, and a former business partner, <ORGANIZATION> Sherman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lair </ORGANIZATION>, 39, of <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION>, also were charged. Hatter ordered <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to be electronically monitored if he goes free and to seek permission from parole officers to leave his home for a doctor's visit or an emergency. Monitoring usually is done through a bracelet locked to the wearer's ankle or wrist that emits a coded electronic signal. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Amdur </PERSON>, said his client was confined to the special housing unit at the downtown <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, an area reserved for problem prisoners or arrested law enforcement officers who can not safely mix with inmates. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a fugitive for seven months, was arrested in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> in July. He was sentenced to six months in jail by a <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> court for a passport violation, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have requested his extradition when his term ends in a few weeks. The trial for all the defendants has been scheduled for April.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> says it will start producing a limited edition of a $ 576,000 car that can attain speeds of more than 200 mph. Chairman Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said Thursday that the car, the XJ220, is as exciting as <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s D-type, which was introduced in the 1950s. `` It is a very interesting project and could herald a pattern for the future,'' he said. The concept model was first revealed at the International Motor Show last year, and consumer interest was so strong that <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> believes it is assured of getting buyers for an initial production of 220 cars. Output could increase to a maximum of 350 cars, if demand is strong enough, said the chairman of the British car maker, which is being acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.5 billion. `` After this we might look at another limited edition. More super cars could follow if there is a demand,'' he said. He added that more than 200 new jobs would be created when production started at a new factory currently being built in <LOCATION> Oxfordshire </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Fifty engineers were already working on the project, he said. The car will be available in left-hand and right-hand drive, but will not be exported to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since it will only meet European regulations. The cars are to be sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Each of the cars will be numbered and customers will have to put down a deposit of $ 80,000. The cars will be delivered in 1992, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was remembered today by colleagues in science, human rights and public affairs as the conscience of a nation struggling to free itself from decades of official lies and corruption. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who freed the physicist from seven years of internal exile, called <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> a `` man of conviction and sincerity.'' `` It's a great loss,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` Academician <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> during this time of perestroika had his mission, his role, and that we all understood.'' `` He was a person who had his own ideas, his own convictions which he expressed openly and directly. This does n't mean I agreed with him, although on many things we did agree,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had repeatedly clashed with <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> recently over the pace and type of reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We have lost our moral compass,'' said <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>, the former head of the Soviet space program who worked with <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, and was named to an official funeral commission. `` An outstanding person has died, such as maybe appears once in a hundred years,'' said fellow deputy <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazannik </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Omsk </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, including both supporters and political foes of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, stood for a minute of silence today morning when his death Thursday night was announced. Linguist <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON>, one of the country's most respected scholars, told the deputies: `` With <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, a part of our heart has departed from us. We could agree or disagree with him, but he was a man of absolute sincerity and absolute purity, and this led him to achievements in science and his position in public life.'' Even long-time members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> apparatus, which under President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> in 1980 ordered his exile to the industrial city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>, praised his honesty and principle. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was exiled Jan. 22, 1980, for criticizing the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> less than a month earlier. But society, as well as top officials, now agree with <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s point of view. Politburo member <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON>, a Politburo member, told the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had been `` one of the country's greatest scientists, a major public figure.'' `` Everything that he did was dictated by his tireless conscience, his deep humanitarian convictions,'' <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON> said. Another Politburo member, conservative <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency: `` I was very well disposed toward <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> as a personality.'' `` He did much for the country. He adhered to different views and positions, but this is only natural,'' <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s last political battle was to try to break the monopoly on political power enjoyed by <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> apparatus. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said in his last public statement that the leadership was bringing the country to a catastrophe. He supported a call to create a formal political opposition. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, a historian who sided with <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> in that political battle, pledged to continue his work. `` We will continue to support the things that he devoted his life to,'' <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> said. Communist reformer <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who with <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was a co-chairman of the Inter-Regional Deputies group of legislators, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was `` the people's conscience, and all honest people in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> and throughout the world will grieve for him.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was difficult politically but based on a mutual understanding of each other's importance, said historian <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, who knew <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> for many years. `` <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> realized the great significance of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, while <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> realized <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s significance in political life, helped him return to politics,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> `` Sometimes <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> went even further and demanded from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> society more than it could provide. But he always treated <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with great respect and always stressed this,'' he said. A veteran <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy official in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Deputy Chief of Mission <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, told reporters <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was important to his country both for the practical work he did and as a symbol of something better. `` If this country is fortunate, the goals he set will someday be reality,'' <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> said.

 The government today recalled more than 100,000 models of a children's playset because they contain small parts that may present a choking hazard to young children. The Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the manufacturer has agreed to replace three components of the plastic `` Play to Learn'' furniture set, model 1411, made by <ORGANIZATION> JA-RU </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The agency said two play figures _ a girl and a boy _ and a plastic lounge chair included in the set are small parts which if swallowed by young children may cause them to choke. Approximately 144,000 sets were sold nationwide since January 1987 but there have been no reports of injury, the commission said. Consumers should take the hazardous parts away from children and request replacements by writing the manufacturer at 4030 Phillips Highway, <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, 32217 or calling 904-733-9311.

<HEAD>Safety Board Announces Hearing on LaGuardia Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said today it will conduct a hearing focusing on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 rudder trim design and cockpit performance in the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jetliner at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The four-day hearing is to begin Feb. 13 at the <ORGANIZATION> Penta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>. The Sept. 20 accident, in which the aircraft skidded off the end of the runway into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> after pilots aborted its takeoff, killed two passengers. The plane lodged on a landing pier and broke into pieces. Board Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, who will conduct the hearing, said he expects about 16 witnesses to testify on cockpit crew training and coordination, design and operation of the rudder trim system and other issues. `` As tragic as this accident was, it could have been much worse,'' <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. `` We have mechanical and human performance issues to resolve in the course of this investigation, and the hearing will provide us with valuable information on both issues.'' The board did not announce who the witnesses would be, but surviving crew members often testify at such hearings. `` We may not know until just before the hearing whether they will appear,'' said <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>. Investigators said the plane's tail rudder, used in steering the airliner, was misaligned despite evidence that the crew made all the proper checks. The pilot reported the plane was drifting to the left before he aborted the takeoff. This focused attention on the trim system that holds the rudder steady during takeoff. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> suspended the pilot's licenses of Capt <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and co-pilot <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleissas </PERSON> after the crash for their failure to appear immediately for drug tests and questioning by investigators. The safety board's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hearing will include a panel of senior <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> staff members and a technical panel of investigators, as well as representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The board, which is an independent federal agency, has no rule-making or enforcement powers. Its findings of probable cause and recommendations will be included in a report to be adopted at a public meeting several months after the hearing, although it can issue urgent recommendations at any time.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> voted today to increase transit fares, raising the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> subway fare from $ 1 to $ 1.15. The new fares, most of which represent an increase of about 15 percent, take effect Jan. 1. They range from the 15-cent increase for subways and buses to a 50 cent rise to $ 4 for express buses in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and an 85 cent increase to $ 6.35 for the JFK airport express train. The board approved the changes as demonstrators waved signs protesting the fare hike and chanted, `` Do the right thing! Stop the fare hike!'' One sign-holder was hustled from the hearing room after he approached the table where the board members were seated. Initially, the <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> proposed sending bus and subway fares to $ 1.25 with discount packages of 18 selling for $ 20. Opponents claimed the idea would discriminate against low-income riders. `` The hearings and the public-comment period served their purpose, which was to get the views of the public and translate them to some degree to the proposals that are being made,'' said <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Davila </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. The 15-cent increase will add about $ 200 million to <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> coffers; the railroads would add another $ 49 million or so and the suburban buses $ 3 million to $ 4 million, <PERSON> Davila </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The crew of a nuclear powered submarine launched its third Trident 2 missile in less than two weeks today, sending an unarmed warhead far down the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> tracking range, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reported. The success was the fourth in six undersea firings of the Trident 2. Three more such tests are planned, leading to operational deployment of the weapon in March. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> anti-nuclear activists were not on the scene today as the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> unleashed the 44-foot, $ 26.5-million missile, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest weapon. On Dec. 4, a large <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> vessel was rammed by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship and two motorized rafts operated by protesters were rounded up and escorted away when they entered the danger zone to try to stop the launch. A launch was conducted on Wednesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warned a 60-foot <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ketch out of a 5,000-yard safety zone surrounding the submarine. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Thursday the group was leaving the area and would take its fight to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reported the success of today's launch 10 minutes after the 9:15 a.m. firing, which took place in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> about 50 miles offshore. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> will be the first of 24 Trident 2 subs to go to sea with the missile. The submarine will carry 24 of the weapons, each able to hurl as many as 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets more than 4,600 miles away.

 Redoubt Volcano hurled a cloud of volcanic ash into the sky again early today, a day after it roared into action, and a pilot reported the gritty ash cloud extended 160 miles from the mountain. Thursday's eruption, the volcano's first activity in 23 years, flung ash seven miles high and prompted the evacuation of seven oil workers. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>, a geologist with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey, said Redoubt erupted today from 1:40 a.m. to about 4:30 a.m. `` It was powerful,'' <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said. `` A pilot reported an ash cloud extending from Redoubt to <LOCATION> Talkeetna </LOCATION> at 3:39,'' he said, adding that there were some reports of flashing lights that probably were caused by glowing lava. <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said the high-altitude cloud of airborne ash blew past <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> and was falling in less populated areas. He said more eruptions were likely. `` I do n't like to use the word ` normal,' but a group of eruptions is typical of a volcano,'' he said. Thursday's eruption of Redoubt, near the western edge of <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION>, 115 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, came a day after scientists detected a significant increase in seismic activity, the Geological Survey said. It `` looked like a little cloud rising over the mountain and it just started rising like an atomic bomb when it mushrooms,'' said <PERSON> Kristopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Paull </PERSON>, pilot of an airliner in the area Thursday. Ash rose from 15,000 feet to about 40,000 feet within 10 minutes, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, who was flying an F-15 jet fighter west of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. Seven of 11 workers at the <LOCATION> Drift </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> oil storage facility were evacuated as a precaution against flooding from melting snow, said the manager of <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inlet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, operator of the facility. Such flooding occurred when the volcano last erupted in 1966. Manager <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouser </PERSON> said the workers were transported in two airplanes, one of which was at the site for a routine grocery delivery. A helicopter stood by for possible evacuation of the four employees who remained at the site as monitors, he said. A truck driver who was on the Sterling Highway, across the inlet from the volcano, when the eruption occurred said the ash was `` real white and fluffy, almost like a cumulus cloud.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paskievitch </PERSON>, a geologist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>, said seismic activity beneath the volcano returned to normal soon after the eruption. He said it was impossible to predict whether more eruptions would occur. The <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said a light dusting of ash was observed in the <LOCATION> Wasilla </LOCATION> area, about 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, shortly after noon Thursday. Redoubt Volcano is within the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> and Preserve and has been active at least four times during this century.

 Leaders and human rights activists worldwide today praised <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> as a tremendous force for freedom who outlived his Soviet persecutors and saw the liberty he championed take root throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The 68-year-old scientist and human rights activist died Thursday night of an apparent heart attack in his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment, his family said. The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stood for a minute of silence for their colleague, once considered a national hero for discovering the Soviet hydrogen bomb but later reviled by <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership for his uncompromising stands for human freedom. He was released from internal exile by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in 1986 and became a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. One lawmaker called him a man `` such as maybe appears once in a hundred years.'' <PERSON> Aase </PERSON> <PERSON> Lionaes </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Norwegian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that awarded <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> the Peace Prize in 1975, said he `` fell in the struggle for democratic reforms. His death represents a great loss, especially at a time with hopes of a positive development in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and in all Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Political leaders worldwide commended <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> as a man whose causes went beyond ideology. <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s death was `` a great loss for reform both in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and everywhere else.'' `` It is very bad that God's sentences are such,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the leader of the Solidarity labor movement, told the Polish news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. `` We needed this man for reforms and for the troubles connected with them.'' `` He was just a remarkable person,'' said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` He was one of those who would always say the truth must be found and was never afraid of stating that and letting everyone know.'' `` It is just sad he will not be preeminent in the freer future of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' she told reporters in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the 518-member <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> today unanimously paid tribute to <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, whose name it had given to its Human Rights Prize. A White House statement today hailed <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> as a historic figure whose voice `` was an important dimension in the contemporary changes under way in Soviet society. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, where he was attending a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> conference, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was `` a tremendous force for peace and freedom.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers hailed <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> as a pioneer who helped change Soviet society. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said, `` The ministers expressed deeply felt sense of loss at the passing of <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>.'' Human rights activist <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, who spent nine years in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> labor camps before immigrating to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1986, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> today that <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had helped thousands of Soviet Jewish refuseniks. `` <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had tremendous influence ... among dissidents, among free people in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and who by his own personal example helped change the whole climate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Staunton </PERSON>, director of the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> `` represented a whole generation of people who were very brave in standing up and struggling in what seemed at that time a hopeless situation.'' `` Everybody looked up to him, his death is really the end of an era,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said: `` I hope the torch will be handed on and that that work, which is not yet complete, will be carried forward by people who will remember him. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON>, member of the Politburo of the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organ L'Humanite: `` He was a victim of the repression of the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> period. His name became a symbol of this repression. Today, he dies a deputy in the congress of the people where he was able to express his opinion freely.'' Former French President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing recalled <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s legendary drive and benevolence: `` I remember the emotion I felt last winter, climbing the damp and dilapidated stairway that led to his apartment. It was he who partially opened the door. I saw on his face the signs of a great man: intelligence and goodness. `` He seemed luminous. That light has gone out. The flame that lived within him will burn forever. His way of defending liberty and human rights was not that of a doctrinaire, but of a liberal. In the passion of his combat, he conserved his benevolence.''

<HEAD>Bulgaria Grants Amnesty to Political Prisoners</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliament today passed an amnesty for political prisoners and changed the penal code so that Bulgarians can no longer be prosecuted for `` anti-state activity'' and `` crimes against allied states.'' On Thursday, Justice Minister <PERSON> Svetla </PERSON> <PERSON> Daskalova </PERSON> told parliament that 53 prisoners would be released in the amnesty. It was not immediately clear if other political detainees would remain in custody. The vote on the penal code changes was unanimous. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> granted amnesty to people jailed for slandering the state and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Before they were freed, independent rights groups in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> said there were up to 250 political prisoners in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Also today, Defense Minister <PERSON> Dobri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzhurov </PERSON> for the first time publicized figures on the country's defense spending. <PERSON> Dzhurov </PERSON> told lawmakers the nation spent $ 670 million over the past year and that the army has 107,000 soldiers. The National Assembly, in a further move to strip former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> of all his public functions, formally terminated his role as commander in chief of the armed forces, which he held as president. He lost that post after being replaced as party chief by <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> on Nov. 10. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> made President <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> commander in chief. The moves are the latest in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s whirlwind drive to transform itself from a hard-line Communist state to one at the forefront of the pro-democracy reform movement sweeping Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. When the legislature opened its session Thursday, tens of thousands of people demonstrated outside the building to demand that the party's leading role, as provided for in the constitution, be abolished. The Communist faction in the parliament had proposed the constitutional clause be scrapped, but officials in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> used a legal technicality to postpone debate on the proposal until January. Before it closed its session this afternoon, parliament adopted its agenda for the January session, which will include debate on a new electoral law providing for free elections and a law on redistribution of land in this traditionally agrarian country. In accordance with another <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> proposal adopted at a party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> session this week, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> set up a commission to investigate corruption under the <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> regime. Parliament voted to include opposition members who are not lawmakers on the commission. This was one of the oppositions' demands, which have been applauded by tens of thousands of Bulgarians at rallies this week

<TEXT>
 The nation's high court today overturned convictions imposed in a controversial treason trial and set free five black activists, three of them senior anti-apartheid leaders jailed since 1985. `` It's fantastic, because now justice has been vindicated,'' said Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, when he and other supporters were told the five men were being flown from their island prison in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The three leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and one of their co-defendants, a church worker, were convicted of treason in November 1988 after a three-year trial. Their sentences ranged from six to 12 years. The Appeal Court in <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION> overturned the verdicts of those four and seven co-defendants convicted of terrorism. One of the seven, who was serving a five-year term, was freed. The others had received suspended sentences. The Appeal Court accepted defense lawyers' arguments that the trial judge, <PERSON> Kees </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON>, improperly dismissed one of the two legal experts assisting him in the trial. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> had said the law professor, W.A. <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON>, was too sympathetic to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> because he had signed a UDF-supported petition opposing a new constitition that entrenched racially segregated politics. During the trial, most of the defendants were granted bail. But <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> repeatedly denied bail requests by the three leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a huge multiracial coalition formed in 1983 to campaign for black political rights. Lawyers for Human Rights, an association of civil rights lawyers, hailed the <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling as `` an excellent victory'' that would help restore the crebility of the South African judiciary. The group called on the government to disclose how much it spent `` on this abortive prosecution which took years of blundering incompetence to achieve nothing but red faces.'' Ambassador <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, one of many countries which denounced the sentences, said the Appeal Court ruling was `` the best Christmas present imaginable.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> had ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> was a `` revolutionary organization'' which incited violence in black townships in 1984 in a bid to render <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> ungovernable. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lekota </PERSON>, 41, the front's publicity secretary, was sentenced to 12 years in prison; <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Molefe </PERSON>, 37, the front's national secretary, and <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, 41, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION>, were sentenced to 10 years The Rev. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Manthata </PERSON>, 49, a church field worker, was sentenced to six years. The trial began in 1985 in the small farming town of <LOCATION> Delams </LOCATION> and later was shifted to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Eleven of the original 22 defendants were acquitted at various stages. The four men convicted of treason were imprisoned on <LOCATION> Robben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s harbor, where many political and security prisoners have been held. Friends and relatives gathered at a ferry dock in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, awaiting their arrival. Among the crowd was Manthata's 5-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Goitse </PERSON>, who was crying with joy. All four men are married and have children. <PERSON> Lekota </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> each have daughters who were born after they were jailed in 1985 and who have never seen their fathers as free men. Also on hand at the ferry landing was one of the defense attorneys, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>. He said the appeal court ruling appeared to be based solely on legal questions and doubted it was related to the changing political climate brought about by President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s easing of curbs on opposition activity. The trial was one of the longest in South African history, with 439 days of court proceedings spread over more than three years. The 368-page indictment named more than 900 alleged co-conspirators, ranging from Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> to African National Congress leader <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>. There were more than 220 witnesses and the official court record contained about 30,000 pages. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> accepted the prosecutors' allegations that the core of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership was supported and guided by the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, the main anti-government guerrilla movement.

<HEAD>US Worried About Possible Terrorist Attacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern today about the possibility that <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> terrorists may be planning a variety of attacks, perhaps against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> targets in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. A brief statement said the concern was based partly on recent reports of movement of terrorists from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the discovery of weapons shipments destined for pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` If credible, specific information or a threat to the public is received, the Department of State will provide additional information for travelers and other concerned parties,'' the statement said. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who asked not to be identified, said the administration has begun briefing foreign governments about its concerns and felt that a warning to the public also was appropriate. One reason for increased fears of terrorist attack, the official said, is the seizure of 440 pounds of explosives Nov. 23 in <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, and the arrest of eight suspected Shiite Moslem extremists by Spanish police. A French police report said the men and explosives were headed for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. According to Spanish police, at least three of the men are members of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, an Iran-backed group of extremist Shiites based in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The official also said there are several anniversaries coming up that terrorists sometimes use as occasions for carrying out violent activities. One was the still unresolved bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight 103 on Dec. 21, 1988 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, with a death toll of 259 aboard the craft and 11 on the ground. According to investigators, evidence points to the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> as the responsible group. Another December incident was the terrorist attacks on airports in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> two days after Christmas in 1985. The official said they also are wary because the number of Americans in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> increases sharply during the Christmas season. Today's advisory contained scant information, but it followed a series of precautionary steps by the French government to guard against the possibility of terrorist attacks during the holiday season. Interior and justice ministers from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> were meeting in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Thursday and today to coordinate efforts to track down a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militant group reportedly responsible for the movement of explosives from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> as well. Some French officials believe the principal aim of the group may be to try to dissuade <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> from from opposing an assault in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Auon </PERSON> by a pro-Syrian Muslim coalition. The French action also coincides with the impending trial of one accused terrorist charged in bombing incidents and a hunger strike by a convicted terrorist who is serving a life term for trying to kill former Iranian Prime Minister <PERSON> Shahpour </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakhtiar </PERSON>. In the latter case, involving the conviction of <PERSON> Anis </PERSON> <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>, the Iranian government has repeatedly demanded that he be released.

<TEXT>
 The 4-year-old boy watched as the television news flashed a picture of jailed South African black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The somewhat dated photograph did not make an impression on the child, the second generation of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s family who has had to see him from afar. `` That's how he used to look,'' the child's mother, <PERSON> Makaziwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, said Wednesday as she watched the report of a historic meeting between her father and South African President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>. The South African Press Association said there was speculation de Klerk could announce a date for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release in a speech Saturday commemorating the Day of the Vow, a major holiday for the Afrikaners who control the government. Although many predict <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> will be released in January, his daughter is suspicious of the white-led government that imprisoned her father in 1962. `` Being a South African and having grown up in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, I still have the negative feeling that they've got something up their sleeve,'' she said from her modest apartment near the University of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, where she is a Fulbright scholar studying anthropology. But that does n't stop her from hoping. `` As a daughter there is a little bit of excitement ... At least I am hoping,'' said <PERSON> Makaziwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 35, who last saw her father earlier this year. `` I barely know my father.'' The youngest of three children from <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s first marriage, `` Maki'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was 8 years old when her father went to prison. She saw little of him when she was growing up, and she said having a heroic figure for a father was sometimes difficult. Seeing other children with fathers at home, or hearing of some in the movement who had left the country with their families, she questioned why her father allowed himself `` to get caught and go to jail.'' But by her mid-20s, she `` came slowly to the realization of why my father had done what he had done,'' she says. In 1985, she decided to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to study. Her husband, <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Amuah </PERSON>, a schoolteacher, later joined her and is pursuing postdoctoral studies. They live here with their three young children and plan to return to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where she hopes to resume work as a community social worker. Wednesday, the 71-year-old <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> visited de Klerk to discuss prospects for negotiating an end to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial conflict, the first meeting between the two. The meeting was denounced by the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and hailed by liberal leaders as a sign that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who took office Aug. 15, accepts <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s outlawed guerrilla movement, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as playing a central role in any political settlement. The black leader's daughter said she's unsure how to read the actions of <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who on Oct. 15 ordered the unconditional release of seven of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> colleagues. `` It is a change. Whether it is a positive change or a negative change I think history will be the better judge,'' she said. But she said she doubts her father would stay free for long unless changes are made in the system. `` Unless they give him -LRB- a larger role -RRB- to play, then I am sad to say that I think <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> will go back to jail because he wo n't sit quietly and accept the system that he tried to bring down,'' she said. And she said she sees no signs of sweeping changes in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> along the lines of the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The biggest challenge facing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is not really the removal of apartheid _ everybody already knows that apartheid is going away _ but to change the attitudes of people,'' she said. `` Getting rid of those attitudes is going to be the big problem.''

<HEAD>Colombia Won't Hold Referendum on Extradition of Traffickers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has effectively killed a proposed referendum that would have allowed Colombians to decide whether the government should continue extraditing drug traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The issue has been eliminated,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> said after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> failed to reach a quorum late Thursday to vote on legislation that would have allowed the national vote on extradition. The outcome was seen as a victory for President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> who began battling the nation's cocaine cartels after they started a fierce bombing and assassination campaign in a bid to stop the extraditions. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> believed the traffickers would have intimidated the people in order to win the vote. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote was necessary to give the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> time to approve the measure before the congressional session ends Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to act also will probably doom constitutional reforms sought by the Barco government. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in defiance of the administration, attached the referendum proposal to the reform legislation on Dec. 5. Among the proposed reforms is a plan that would allow candidates backed by leftist guerrillas of the April M19 Movement to run for congress and win seats with fewer votes than normally required. In exchange, the guerrillas would lay down their arms. M19 said it will cancel its political campaign in light of the legislative developments. The group said in a communique that the government should postpone congressional elections scheduled for March 11 and presidential elections set for May 27. `` Normal elections in a country that has become unhinged would carry us toward greater levels of violence,'' the communique said. The M19 Movement is the only one of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s five leftist guerrilla groups to hold peace talks with the government. The Barco administration has viewed fulfilling its agreement with M19 as essential to persuade other groups to negotiate. But administration officials still appeared pleased by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to vote. While constitutional reform may be lost this session, Interior Minister <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> told reporters that the sacrifice was worth it because it prevented `` the interference of drug traffickers in congressional decisions.'' The traffickers had sought a national vote on the extraditions. <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> has said the drug lords would intimidate voters into rejecting the policy if balloting on the issue were allowed. The government's latest anti-drug offensive began after traffickers assassinated Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> on Aug. 18. He was a leading presidential candidate and an anti-drug crusader. The Barco administration revived its extradition policy with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as part of the crackdown and so far has sent nine people to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face drug charges. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine barons responded with a bombing campaign. So far there have been 203 attacks that have killed 188 people and wounded 1,238. Government officials have blamed traffickers for the bombing of a Colombian airliner on Nov. 27 that exploded shortly after takeoff from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, killing 107 people on board. Officials also blame the drug lords for the Dec. 4 bombing of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s secret police headquarters that killed 63 people. A few hours after that blast news media in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> received a communique that said traffickers would continue the attacks until congress approved a national referendum on the extradition policy.

 There are flags for nations, states, cities, clubs and teams, but until now there was no flag for the whole world. `` Heck, <ORGANIZATION> McDonalds </ORGANIZATION>' even has a flag,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffmann </PERSON>, one of two <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> men who have designed a `` Global Flag.'' <PERSON> Roffmann </PERSON> said Thursday that he hoped to have the flag flying over every country of the world by the end of 1992 to remind people that they are all `` citizens'' of the planet <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` Seeing ourselves as one planet _ no divisions, no boundaries _ helps us envision the new levels of cooperation and interdependence we need as we move into the most critical decade of human history,'' <PERSON> Roffmann </PERSON> said. `` Our survival depends on our ability to think globally and act locally,'' he said. The 3-by-5 Global Flag is midnight blue, and in the center is a full-color reproduction of the `` full earth'' photograph taken by Apollo 17 en route to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roffmann </PERSON> said he and his partner, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, already had arranged to have the flag flying at the Global Forum on Environment and Development for Survival and the Soviet-American Citizens' Summit, both in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next month They also hope to have it incorporated into World Peace Day activities around the world on Dec. 31, as well as the global Earth Day 1990, on April 22. `` It would be marvelous if the next time we go to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, instead of planting the American flag, we planted this global flag,'' <PERSON> Roffmann </PERSON> said. In the first few weeks of their project, <PERSON> Roffmann </PERSON> said, about 100 Global Flags have been distributed to people and organizations. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the flags, which run about $ 50, will go to organizations involved in Campaign for the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, a 10-year campaign to create a peaceful, sustainable world that will kick off Dec. 31.

 An artist took a bronze bull by the horns _ well, he used a truck and forklift, actually _ and deposited it in front of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is my Christmas present for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

The Sicilian-born sculptor said he began the statue after the 1987 stock market crash. He wanted to create `` a monumental work attesting to the vitality, energy and life of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people in adversity.'' Despite calling the statue a Christmas present, the artist told the paper he would like to sell the work. He hopes authorities will let it stay until New Year's Day. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment on the matter this morning.

<TEXT>
 The mayor of <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION> signed an order Friday that will close the Leaning Tower to the public from Jan. 7 to April 7 for safety reasons. Mayor <PERSON> Giacomino </PERSON> <PERSON> Granchi </PERSON> said officials would at least consider adopting safety measures that would allow a limited reopening of the tower to the public. Public Works Minister <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Prandini </PERSON> has voiced concern about its stability. The 180-foot tower began to tilt almost from the time <PERSON> Bonnano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pisano </PERSON> started building it in 1173 because the ground shifted underneath. It now leans about 13 feet off the perpendicular, but experts in <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION> said it would not topple for at least another century if it continued at the same rate. The city stands to lose money from about 800,000 tourists a year who pay $ 3.07 apiece to climb the tower. <PERSON> Prandini </PERSON> has said the government wo n't reimburse <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION>, contending that visitors will still flock to see the tower and thus the tourist industry wo n't suffer. He also guaranteed that the government will pay for the restoration work, expected to cost about $ 107.6 million.

<HEAD>Charge Dropped After Prosecutor Withdraws DNA Evidence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Charges against a man accused of sexually molesting a 5-year-old girl were thrown out after the accuracy of DNA analysis, sometimes called genetic fingerprinting, was questioned. The defense lawyer says the doubt raised about the reliability of the DNA tests should trigger a re-examination of the use of such tests in criminal prosecutions. `` This case opens up serious questions concerning dozens of convictions and pleas across the country that are based on DNA typing,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Libby </PERSON>, attorney for a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> man in a case involving the state's first use of genetic coding to identify a suspect. A <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor withdrew the DNA evidence on Sunday and charges against <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> alleging he committed a sexual act with a 5-year-old girl were dropped. In seeking to block the use of the DNA evidence, <PERSON> Libby </PERSON> raised questions about the techniques used by <ORGANIZATION> Lifecodes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Valhalla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, to analyze the sample. <ORGANIZATION> Lifecodes </ORGANIZATION>, one of only three DNA testing laboratories in the nation, deemed the DNA from semen that was evidence of the molestation to be a match with DNA in a blood sample taken from <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>. But during a pre-trial hearing last week to decide whether to admit the results as evidence, Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Lifecodes </ORGANIZATION> testified that the match was not precise because the DNA sample from the semen was `` degraded'' from exposure to the elements. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Lifecodes </ORGANIZATION>, defended the company's procedures. `` We feel the technique is very reliable,'' she said. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadner </PERSON> declined to comment on the case but indicated that his office would not rule out the use of DNA typing in future prosecutions. `` What happened in the <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> case is in no way a reflection on the future of DNA testing, and any assertions to the contrary are taking advantage of a unique situation,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a complex molecule found mainly in the nucleus of living cells and plays a vital role in heredity. Because it contains genetic information unique to each individual, it has been used by forensic researchers to positively identify suspects in criminal cases. Developed in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, DNA typing was accepted as evidence for the first time in this country last year in a criminal trial in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Since then, DNA evidence has been used in at least 100 criminal cases, mostly rape and murder prosecutions, in 23 states. Similar quality control problems at <ORGANIZATION> Lifecodes </ORGANIZATION> led a court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to reject part of a DNA test as evidence in a murder trial last year. <ORGANIZATION> Lifecodes </ORGANIZATION> subsequently said it had solved its quality control problems.

 Two former executives of Norden Systems today admitted they conspired to obtain confidential <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> bid information on a lucrative <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> contract. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapinac </PERSON>, a former senior vice president, and <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a former marketing official, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government and convert government property. The two acknowledged that they conspired in 1987 to pay defense consultant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> $ 49,500 to obtain the information about the contract for a radar command and control system valued at up to $ 150 million. <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>, who was convicted Thursday of participating in a separate bribery scheme, obtained the information from fellow defense consultant <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, according to court papers filed by prosecutors. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, who has not been charged in the continuing investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement fraud, is alleged to have obtained the bid information from former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement official <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>. Stone has not yet been charged in the investigation, nicknamed Operation Ill Wind. The pleas by <PERSON> Rapinac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> were accepted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, who scheduled sentencing for March 9. Both defendants could receive up to five years' imprisonment and be fined as much as $ 250,000. In a statement, <PERSON> Rapinac </PERSON> said, `` While I offer no excuses for my actions, I do believe the defense acquisition process is conducive to abuses.'' Earlier in the day, <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> sentenced two former executives of another defense firm, <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, on their guilty pleas to bribery charges in an unrelated scheme. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON>, 59, a former vice president of a <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> subsidiary, was ordered to serve 10 months in prison and fined $ 10,000 for his role in a scheme to funnel more than $ 80,000 to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement official. Also sentenced was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassel </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> employee, who received a three-month term in a halfway house for his role in the scheme. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassel </PERSON>, who headed the California-based defense firm's <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, operation, was also fined $ 3,000. Both men had pleaded guilty Sept. 26 to bribery charges in connection with a scheme to funnel money to former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> contracting official <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>. The bribes were funneled through <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>, who was convicted Thursday of eight charges, including bribery and conspiracy. Both <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassel </PERSON> testified as prosecution witnesses against <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> acknowledged that both men had cooperated with the government's investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement fraud, nicknamed `` Operation Ill Wind.'' <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassel </PERSON> played a minor role in the scheme. Before he was sentenced, <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> to show leniency for <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassel </PERSON>, who he said `` only acted as a good trouper who carried out my orders.'' <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassel </PERSON> were executives of <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION>, which was taken over by <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> in 1986. <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> was a vice president and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassel </PERSON> was head of <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> operation. Van Tassel now lives in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> lives near <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. Another former <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> executive, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, was acquitted of all bribery and conspiracy charges against him by the same jury that convicted <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> The jury's verdict against <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> followed more than two days of testimony, including tape recordings of wiretapped conversations involving <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>, company officials and other defense consultants. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> testified he made repeated protests to <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> about the bribery scheme but was told to mind his own business. <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> testified <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> did object but later stopped. The testimony was offered to try to convince jurors that <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> eventually acquiesced. `` Ill Wind blew itself out,'' <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Topel </PERSON>, said after the verdict. `` In their zeal to broaden this investigation, -LRB- prosecutors -RRB- put too much reliance on the credibility of their informants.'' Hilton scheduled <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>'s sentencing for Feb. 16. He faces a possible 70-year prison term and a maximum fine of $ 1.04 million. During the trial, <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> testified he negotiated to receive more than $ 80,000 worth of bribes in return for helping <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> get </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> electronic contracts. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> and two other defense consultants, who also testified as government witnesses, served as conduits for the payments. <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> and he split the bribe money, with <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> taking a third. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, who is serving an 18-month prison term after pleading guilty to a separate scheme, recalled receiving $ 25,000 from <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, was a stockholder and vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION>. He became a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> after the 1986 takeover. The <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> subsidiary pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy and paid $ 3.5 million in penalties. More than 25 individuals and four corporations have been convicted in the continuing investigation. In the only other trial, a former <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> executive was acquitted last spring during a trial at which two of his colleagues were convicted for their roles in the influence-peddling scandal.

 A state lawmaker has proposed a $ 1 fine for anyone who beats up a person who burns or desecrates <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> or state flags. Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrarca </PERSON>, a Democrat, introduced the legislation earlier this week. The $ 1 fine would replace the normal penalties for assault or aggravated assault. A person convicted of aggravated assault could be sentenced to 10 years in jail and fined $ 25,000. <PERSON> Petrarca </PERSON> said he offered the bill because the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was unwilling to seek a constitutional amendment to punish flag burners. `` Since so many of our neighbors and family members have made huge sacrifices to protect it on foreign battlefields, sometimes with their lives, I feel desecrating the flag is a matter to be taken extremely seriously,'' <PERSON> Petrarca </PERSON> said in a statement. The fate of the bill is uncertain. `` I ca n't imagine this is going to go anywhere,'' Rep. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kukovich </PERSON>, the Democrats' policy chairman, told The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>. `` But who knows?

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pressed `` the real thing'' when he switched on the National Christmas Tree, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Friday, but he hesitated when asked the same question about former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I better let that go,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said when asked if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had used a phony button in the years that he lit the tree from the safety of a White House balcony, several hundred yards from the tree. `` Is your non-answer an answer?'' he was asked. `` Well, sort of,'' responded <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who served as press spokesman to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before taking on the same assignment with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Asked about this year's ceremony, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> asserted without hesitation: `` Last night was the real thing.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lit the 35-foot national tree on Thursday night in person at a public outdoor ceremony on the Ellipse. During his eight years in office, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stayed within the White House complex for the ceremony, supposedly lighting the Christmas tree by remote control. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was pressed about speculation that the button <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pushed each year was not attached to anything, and that a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officer actually lit the tree from the site. `` I think that's a question for <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, referring to the current press spokesman in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> office. However, <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> made it clear he did n't want to get into details of the situation. `` All I know is when the president pushed the button, the tree lighted up,'' <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said in a telephone interview.

<TEXT>
 Excerpts from the Nobel lecture of <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, which was read by his wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, on Dec. 12, 1975:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Peace, progress, human rights _ these three goals are insolubly linked to one another: it is impossible to achieve one of these goals if the other two are ignored.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 I am convinced that international confidence, mutual understanding, disarmament and international security are inconceivable without an open society with freedom of information, freedom of conscience, the right to publish and the right to travel and choose the country in which one wishes to live. I am likewise convinced that freedom of conscience, together with the other civic rights, provides the basis for scientific progress and constitutes a guarantee that scientific advances will not be used to despoil mankind, providing the basis for economic and social progress, which in turn is a political guarantee of the possibility of an effective defense of social rights.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The main solution to the problem of persecuting persons with deviant views must be liberation on the basis of international agreements, a liberation of all political prisoners, of all prisoners of conscience in prisons, internment camps and psychiatric clinics, if necessary on the basis of a resolution passed by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. This proposal involves no intervention in the internal affairs of any country. After all, it would apply to every country on the same basis, to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, to the Republic of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and to every other country. Since the protection of human rights has been proclaimed in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, this can not for this reason be said to be a matter of purely internal or domestic concern. In order to achieve this great goal, no exertions are too great, however long the road may seem.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 I am profoundly convinced that it would be better to liberate a certain number of people, even though they may be guilty of some offense or other, than to keep thousands of innocent people locked up and exposed to torture. We need reform, not revolution. We need a pliant, pluralist, tolerant community which selectively and tentatively can bring about a free, undogmatic use of the experiences of all social systems.

 Eighteen trade-union activists were arrested Friday outside the White House when they blocked a gate during a peaceful protest over the deaths of labor leaders in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Maj. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Spruill </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Park Police said the demonstrators were charged with demonstrating without a permit, a misdemeanor. Their permit was revoked when they sat down on the frigid <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> sidewalk and blocked the gate, <PERSON> Spruill </PERSON> said. The protesters, demanding a cutoff of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said more than 100 trade unionists had been abducted and killed in a wave of violence that began Oct. 31 with a bombing at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. Ten people died in that explosion.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> shared little personally except a mutual respect and a commitment to change. As they went before the nation in a parliamentary session this week, they could not have appeared more different: <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, at the pinnacle of his power, was robust and self-confident; <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was stooped and stammering. And yet, the times dictated that they work together, and it was <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s relationship to the Soviet president that defined his role in an era of reform. It was a sign of the program of change that <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> long had urged and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> instituted that Soviets could watch the two men struggle with each other at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies parliament. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> died Thursday evening in his study, preparing to challenge <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> once more on the political supremacy of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> leads. `` It's a great loss,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Friday during a break in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had served as a parliamentarian. `` During this time of perestroika, <PERSON> Academician </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had his mission, his role, and that we all understood. He was a man of conviction and sincerity. He was not some sort of political intriguer.'' The Soviet public liked and respected <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> at least as much as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. An unscientific poll conducted by the weekly Arguments and Facts in October found <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> the country's most popular politician, more popular than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> freed <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> from the exile in the industrial city of Gorky imposed by <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, and withdrew Soviet soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It was <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s criticism of the intervention into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> 10 years ago that led to his exile in <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>. Even though <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> owed his return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from the living hell of isolation, force-feedings and surveillance in <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> never dominated <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> spoke out in favor of the reforms <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> instituted because they matched his own ideals, but in the past several months had become increasingly critical of the pace of the reform and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s accumulation of power. He said the country had no alternative to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s leadership but prodded the Soviet president to push harder. The day he died, he told a group of like-minded deputies that the Soviet leadership's hesitancy to press more radical reform was leading the country to catastrophe. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> told the first <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in June: `` I personally respect <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeyevich </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> very much, but it is dangerous to give so much power even to the initiator of perestroika.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> continually challenged <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but was no match as a public speaker to the vigorous and self-confident president. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> stammered, rambled and spoke in a high-pitched voice, often losing his audience even when it supported him. He often pressed issues that a smarter politician would have left alone. Deputies hounded him in June for allegations that the Soviet military had hunted down and killed its own soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> rather than risk their captured by rebels. In recently released excerpts of a book to be published next year, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> usually greeted him with a smile that was `` half-kindly, half-condescending.'' Even when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tried to silence him, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> insisted on being heard. Their last exchange was shown to millions of Soviets on live TV on Tuesday, the opening day of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' winter session. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> the right to speak after having denied it to a previous deputy, but cut him off abruptly when he began challenging the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s grip on power. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> handed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a stack of telegrams in support of his position, and the Soviet leader retorted: `` You come to me, I will give you three files of telegrams.'' Even though <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> in exile in December 1986 to tell him he could return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the two did not meet until more than a year later, Jan. 15, 1988. Typically, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> handed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a list of 200 prisoners still held for their political beliefs.

 Lawmakers controlled by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> today named him head of the government and granted him sweeping powers, saying they took the action to confront a `` state of war'' because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions. The unanimous resolution by the 510-member <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief picked, said <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> was being designated `` maximum leader for national liberation.'' The move formally gives <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> greater powers than provisional President <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a situation that already existed de facto. Several thousand <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters surrounded the assembly as it met and cheered as the resolution passed. `` The Republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is declared to be in a state of war while the aggression lasts,'' said the resolution. `` To confront this aggression, the job of chief of government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is hereby created, and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is designated to carry out these responsibilities as maximum leader for national liberation.'' The resolution gave <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> the power to appoint public officials, control foreign relations, convoke the assembly, and `` make decisions on whatever other matter or unforeseen circumstance that affect the national life and the interests of the country.'' Asked about the move, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` This ia charade and nonsense. As far as we are concerned, at least, there is no government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> anyway. <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandeck </PERSON>, a delegate from the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Ancon </LOCATION>, predicted Thursday that the assembly would give <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> the post. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> friend since high school, was picked as president after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> halted vote-counting in a popular election in May, backed the general for the new post Thursday. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> annulled returns from the May 7 vote when they showed the opposition winning by a landslide. The move also blocked the election of a new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, so <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> picked a new legislative body. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on federal drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to oust him with economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> told the assembly Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had `` declared war on all Panamanians'' with its economic sanctions. `` It is not <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> they want to do away with,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. `` They want to do away with our national capacity to be independent.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has weathered more than a year of the sanctions, opposition demonstrations and two attempted coups from inside the Defense Forces. As chief executive, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would hold the same title as that of dictator <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, who negotiated treaties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to transfer the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to Panamanian control at the end of the century and close down <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to force his ouster because it wants to renege on the treaties. In another move against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chandeck </PERSON> said he will be distributing `` wanted'' posters for two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> generals. <LOCATION> Chandeck </LOCATION> has filed charges of destroying Panamanian property against Gen. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, commander of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION>; and Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> that includes all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The generals were charged in <LOCATION> Ancon </LOCATION>, Chandeck's constituency. They were accused of destroying public property by driving armored personnel carriers on public roads and by other actions. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military twice rejected court summons for <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials offered in one letter the `` courtesy'' of facilitating `` the transfer of custody of selected fugitives pending drug-trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' That was a reference to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the charges against him. Borough officials did not respond to the tongue-in-cheek offer. Instead, they issued an arrest warrant for <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chandeck </PERSON> said he now plans to distribute `` wanted'' posters of <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> all over the country. `` We will have their pictures and a big ` wanted' sign on top,'' he said.

 Ignoring demonstrators chanting `` Shame! Shame! Shame!'' the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> voted Friday to raise its bus and subway fares 15 cents to $ 1.15. In addition to the first subway fare hike in four years, the <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> board approved increases averaging 15 percent for the commuter trains and express buses that serve the city's outer boroughs and suburbs. `` No one likes a fare increase, but it does cost money to get things done,'' explained <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON>. `` Service is getting better.'' The average fare increase of 15 percent compared favorably with a 22 percent increase in the cost of living since the last hike, he said. Dozens of protesters, including a contingent of Guardian Angels, circled outside the <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Inside, the board's session was punctuated by shouts of `` You' r stealing food out of people's mouths! and `` Let the people vote on the fare!'' When board member <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Libert </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> if the demonstrators could be quieted, <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> replied: `` This will be a test of your attention span, <PERSON> Herb </PERSON>.'' Guards threw one sign-carrying demonstrator out of the room after he approached the table where board members were sitting. The new fares take effect Jan. 1. The TA had proposed boosting bus and subway fares to $ 1.25 with discount packages of 18 tokens for $ 20, but that was hooted down at public hearings. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> officials said this week they would veto the fare increase for <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> trains running from that state into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` If <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> fails to make us whole, we would put on a level of service -LRB- for <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> -RRB- that would reflect that,'' <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> said. He said about $ 7.7 million in cuts for <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> service would be necessary if state officials persist in their veto and refuse to increase the state's direct subsidy to <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>. The new fares include increasing <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> fares 15 percent to 20 percent. An off-peak, 10-trip ticket will be sold at 10 percent off the regular fare, and there will be off-peak `` family fares'' under which children riding with a parent pay 50 cents a ride. The $ 1 penalty for buying tickets on the train will be increased to $ 2.

 Proof that peace is breaking out all over comes this weekend with the inspection of a top-secret `` Star Wars'' laser lab by Soviet scientists. The Soviets wo n't be shown everything, as much of the project remains secret. The Pentagon described the visit as a trial to evaluate a proposed space defense treaty. The `` confidence-building'' tours are designed to show how inspections of Strategic Defense Initiative research facilities would work under the treaty recently proposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the Pentagon said. `` The visit will offer Soviet experts an opportunity to see how one of the U.S.-proposed measures, visits to laboratories, would work in practice,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. Other proposals include data exchanges and observation of tests. Ten scientists, led by Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON>, head of the Soviet delegation to the Nuclear and Space Talks, will be briefed Saturday at the TRW plant regarding the planned space-based anti-missile system, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The delegation will visit a second SDI research facility at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, on Monday and Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soviets were scheduled to arrive Friday at <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator for the Nuclear and Space Talks, will accompany the delegation. At the <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> lab near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION> the Soviets will investigate the Alpha laser facility. It is the centerpiece of the Zenith Star project, which the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> hopes will prove the viability of using space-based lasers to shoot down hostile missiles or satellites. The hydrogen fluoride laser uses high-combustion fuels to create energy, which then is amplified by mirrors and resonant chambers intended to create a concentrated beam of light capable of destroying vehicles in space. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> is the name for a 50-ton, 80-foot-long carrier for the Alpha laser. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, the Soviet team will be briefed on the evolution of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> work on Neutral Particle Beam technology, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The scientists will view the BEAR Neutral Particle beam payload which was launched into space and recovered in July 1989, and also will see the device operate in the lab.

 A county commissioner and three others were convicted of illegally making and selling equipment used to descramble pay-TV channels, a case a defense attorney said was the first of its type in the nation. Dale County Commissioner <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Herring </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Herring </PERSON>, were convicted Thursday of three counts each of conspiracy to manufacture, assemble, possess and sell video deciphers modified to receive scrambled television signals on premium pay channels without authorization. The Herring brothers and two others were convicted under a 1968 federal wiretap law that was amended by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 to include electronic communications. Defense Attorneys <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkman </PERSON> said their clients sold the devices openly and did not know the amended wiretap law applied to descrambling. The defense contended the law was intended to apply to bugging devices, not satellite transmission receivers. A new federal law, which went on the books in January, specifically covers descrambling. The four were charged with selling descrambling equipment in December 1987 and June 1988, before the new anti-descrambling law was passed. <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said the prosecution was the first against descrambling of pay-TV channels using the federal wiretap law. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> could not confirm that, but said it is one of the first. `` We're naturally disappointed with the verdict,'' <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said. `` We do n't think the defendants had sufficient notice that what they are accused of was a violation of the wiretap statute.'' In addition to the Herrings' convictions, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Goshen </LOCATION> was convicted of two counts of conspiracy and <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Ariton </LOCATION> was convicted of one count. <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Herring </PERSON> owns Tri-State Satellite in <LOCATION> Brundidge </LOCATION>, and the other three worked for him. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> did not set a sentencing date. The four remain free on $ 5,000 bond apiece. Each defendant could get up to five years in prison and fined $ 250,000 on each count. <ORGANIZATION> Dale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON> said state law requires that <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Herring </PERSON> step down from his post.

<HEAD>County Proposal Would Halt Growth In Nation's Hottest Housing Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 King County officials are considering a proposal that could bring growth in the nation's hottest housing market to a grinding halt. The proposal, unveiled Thursday by County Councilman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, would block housing construction in unincorporated <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> until after adequate roads, schools and other services are built. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> and co-sponsor Councilwoman <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the proposal aims to shift the power to make land use decisions to the public, essentially giving them veto rights over developments if their neighborhoods are being overwhelmed by growth. In May, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> voters adopted limits on downtown growth in one of the city's first demonstrations of discontent with the fast pace of development. If the county council approves the measure, it would put an amendment of the council's charter on the Nov. 6, 1990, general election ballot. The proposed amendment reads: `` No county officials shall have the authority to approve private development where facilities will not be adequate, unless an emergency is found to exist.'' That would eliminate the discretion county officials have to approve development plans when services are not in place. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> listed roads, sewers, water, schools, open space and surface water drainage as key services that would have to be in place before ground is broken for a project. `` We're taking away the permissiveness that has allowed growth to occur before we have the infrastructure to support it,'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said. He said he would formally introduce the ordinance at Monday's council meeting A simple majority on the nine-member council is needed for approval. `` What it does is require communities to ` pay as they grow' and that's something we've been promoting for over a year,'' said newly elected council member <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Derdowski </PERSON>, a slow-growth activist. Developers criticized the measure as a `` poorly drafted'' ordinance that fails to define what is adequate service. `` If this ordinance passes, -LRB- housing -RRB- prices will skyrocket,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Master </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said a later ordinance would define which services would be included and what would be considered adequate. The measure comes as the median cost of a single-family home in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area is rising at 23.7 percent a year, up from $ 88,900 to $ 110,000 in the past year, the fastest pace in the nation, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. The population is also swelling, with an estimated 650,000 more people expected by 2020. The 2,128-square-mile county has about 1.4 million residents, about 31 percent of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state's population. Incorporated areas include <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and its suburbs, with a total of about 1 million people. Much of the eastern part of the county is unincorporated. The county has grown by about 190,000 people during the past decade, with newcomers accounting for about half the increase. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> was named the nation's most liveable city this year by the Places Rated Almanac, in part because of its affordable real estate.

 <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> remained free during his toughest years as a dissident because he held a unique position in Soviet society that stymied official attempts to silence or expel him. Because of his top-level scientific reputation and the huge support he received from the West, authorities feared that jailing <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> could threaten <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s struggle to forge a 1970s detente with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Soviet authorities sometimes dealt with troublesome dissidents by expelling them from the country. But because <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was a key developer of the Soviet hydrogen bomb, the security-obsessed bureaucracy could n't imagine that course, either. Once abroad, officials feared, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> could divulge critical Soviet nuclear secrets. Meanwhile, the honors <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> won for his scientific work and his membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> gave him privileges that set him far apart from other dissidents, who were often impoverished and little-known. Foreign visitors, including parliament members and diplomats, came frequently to <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s apartment in a prestigious area of downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. As a result of his academy membership, the physicist enjoyed a hefty salary and the use of chauffeured cars, even as he suffered surveillance by the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> and vilification in the official press. Yet the threatening police presence around him and the official denunciations still put pressures on <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> that required substantial personal courage. His colleagues in the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> frequently castigated him in public, although they never voted him out of membership, and he often received threatening letters. And he never knew when his espousing of human rights and environmental causes might lead to the abrupt end of his privileges, and his fall into the world of brutal repression where many other dissidents lived. Until he was banished to the city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> in 1980, suffering many of the horrors that other dissidents faced, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s special status made it natural for him to become a central figure in the dissident movement in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Dissidents felt that if they could only contact <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and get him to speak for them, they would acquire a measure of safety from persecution. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> in reality could offer them little protection, but he rarely failed to welcome them. Dissidents from all over the nation, sometimes 15 or 20 at a time, squeezed into his two-room apartment on <LOCATION> Chkalova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to beseech him for help, and to meet with Western reporters. The book-lined, disorderly apartment was usually filled with the smell of tea brewing in the kitchen. As many as seven members of the <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> family, who slept at night on sofas and the floor, milled around with the visiting dissidents, foreign camera crews and foreign supporters. <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s outspoken wife, presided over the chaos, sometimes giving interviews herself or jumping in to answer a question asked of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. The telephone rang constantly. Authorities at times cut off his international phone service, but <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> usually was able to make and receive calls within <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and often relayed messages from one dissident to another. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s mail service functioned, too, bringing him as many as 20 appeals for help a week from dissidents throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> believed the mail was read and the phone calls monitored by authorities, but felt he had little to fear because he made no secret of his dissident activities. Along with his <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> salary of 530 rubles a month _ nearly three times that of the average Soviet worker _ <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had other privileges stemming from his three `` Hero of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'' awards for his scientific work. By showing a special card, he could ride buses and subways for free, get priority airline and train tickets and go to the head of lines at stores and theaters. He traveled occasionally, sometimes attending the trials of dissidents in other cities. Yet despite his special status, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> suffered many pressures. Frail in appearance, he often seemed stung and despairing after a new press attack or a threatening, anonymous phone call. When he visited a foreign diplomat or journalist, <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents would tail him by car. There were rumors the neighbors in his apartment building had been recruited to spy on him. Yet <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> never seemed interested in leaving the country or toning down his dissident activities. `` I have never considered emigrating. Not for one minute. It never entered my head,'' he said in 1977, the year President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> sent him a strong letter of support that gave him a new measure of safety. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s freedom did not last indefinitely. In 1980, the authorities finally stripped him of his official honors and then exiled him for six years to <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>, a city closed to foreigners. There, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was almost entirely isolated from the outside world and subjected to a far higher level of threats and harassment than he ever experienced in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> staged hunger strikes in protest. The authorities responded with painful force-feeding. According to his wife, a doctor in <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> once told him: `` We wo n't let you die, but we will make you an invalid.'' But the state never jailed him and never expelled him from the scientific community _ an enduring sign of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s special role in Soviet life.

 Some Americans and other foreigners are considering leaving and would-be visitors are canceling trips amid fears of terrorism following the failed bid to overthrow President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` It's a very critical situation,'' said a travel agent who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` If this goes on, Americans will leave this country. The rebels have accomplished what they would want to do _ create panic.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats say there has been no exodus of foreigners, who included about 100,000 Americans, since mutineers in the military staged a nine-day coup attempt that started Dec. 1. But rumors of a new attempt are sweeping the city. Travel agents and other sources in the foreign community say many foreigners have lost confidence in the Aquino government and plan to leave if the situation deteriorates. Travel agents said they are swamped with requests for open-dated airline tickets from worried foreigners as well as wealthy Filipinos. None of the agents wanted to be quoted by name for fear of being accused of hurting the travel industry. `` Wealthy Filipinos are more scared. They are frantic,'' said an American travel agent. `` Americans are a little bit more sturdy. They are not leaving now but they are preparing to leave. They want to be able to get out of the airport until they feel danger is over.'' The recent coup attempt shook the foreign community more than the previous five during the Aquino administration because much of the fighting occurred in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION>, the financial district where thousands of foreigners live. Hundreds of tourists and business travelers, including at least 164 Americans, were trapped for four days during fierce fighting in the district. Also, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to order <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> war jets to support government troops raised fears of reprisals against Americans. On Thursday, unidentified assailants fired two grenades into a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government housing area. The attack caused no injuries but reinforced fears that foreigners were no longer safe. `` They are not very happy with the situation,'' another travel agent said. `` They worry that there's going to be a coup, there's not going to be one, -LRB- there will be -RRB- terrorist attacks They feel they are not very safe going out into the streets or shopping. They feel very insecure.'' Although careful not to play up the strains, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy has made available `` stress counseling'' for those either shaken by the coup attempt or nervous about the possibility of another one. Some people have left temporarily for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> or other neigboring countries, but travel agents are not overjoyed by the extra business. `` It's not the kind of business I like because if they leave for good, then it would pull business downward,'' said one travel agent. `` If they get too panicky that means a loss of corporate revenues.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been reviewing their procedures for helping American nationals leave the country in case of an emergency. Several other expatriate organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, have set up networks to keep foreigners informed of the situation. Meanwhile, tourist officials say would-be visitors are canceling trips. Tourism Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrucho </PERSON> said the travel industry may lose up to $ 550 million in gross earnings next year because of estimates that up to 500,000 prospective tourists will travel elsewhere. One travel agent said 500 of 6,000 delegates who earlier confirmed they would attend an international medical convention here in February already have backed out. Hotel managers, who had been turning away guests a month ago, said occupancy in some five-star establishments has dropped as low as 29 percent. Occupancy at the country's most luxurious hotels, <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Hotel and <ORGANIZATION> Westin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION>, has dropped by 50 percent, managers said.

 Stripping in the aisles of <PERSON> Filene </PERSON>'s Basement, an intricate art perfected by die-hard bargain hunters over the years, will pass into history when the store builds women's dressing rooms in February. The state announced Friday that the store had agreed to build the dressing rooms in response to two complaints filed with the state's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discrimination </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Filene </PERSON>'s Basement has long had a nationwide reputation as a place for savvy shoppers to stop on tours of the historic city. The store's fame was augmented during the 1988 presidential campaign, when voters learned candidate Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> bought his suits there. But the store has no changing rooms for women, although men have dressing rooms. <PERSON> Jeanne-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabe </PERSON>, one of the women who lodged a complaint, said Friday she was outraged when she learned men had a place to change, while women had to wriggle in and out of clothes in the aisles. One Christmas, she had to return a number of items that did n't fit `` I was really getting mad waiting in line and thinking men do n't have to do this,'' said Cabe. She filed her complaint in 1988, two years after <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugill </PERSON> brought her complaint. <PERSON> Hugill </PERSON> also was surprised to learn men had a dressing room. She filed her complaint after trying to buy a bathing suit. It was not returnable, so she could n't take it home to try on. An employee told her about the facilities for men. `` I had no idea there were men's dressing rooms,'' she said. `` Obviously, I thought that was not right.'' <ORGANIZATION> MCAD </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, whose office worked out the agreement with <PERSON> Filene </PERSON>'s Basement, said she has friends who refuse to shop at the store because there's no place to try on clothes. `` I do n't know why anyone has not filed a complaint before,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` It's one of those insults women maybe thought they had to ignore, and move onto the next place.'' <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, has 25 stores in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Anathan </PERSON>, the company's president. All the other stores have changing rooms for women. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> store once had a changing room that was removed to make way for customers and merchandise. `` We really found we could n't accommodate the velocity and the traffic down there,'' <PERSON> Anathan </PERSON> said. He pointed out the new room will be small _ only about 140 square feet. `` It's probably going to create more problems for us than solutions,'' he said. An informal survey of women combing the racks at <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s on Friday elicited cries of `` Wonderful!'' from basement patrons. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a Filene's Basement shopper for 25 years, said she wo n't miss the changing technique she has perfected over the years. `` You pick up a raincoat _ if you have n't worn a coat _ and change under that without a bit of skin showing,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The news even brought sighs of relief from men, including one who is used to the sight of women in various states of undress. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Maccarro </PERSON>, a bartender at a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> striptease club who was buying bluejeans for his daughter, said he finds it embarrassing to see women changing in the aisles. `` There's certain things for certain places,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The crew of the nuclear-powered submarine <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> successfully launched its third Trident 2 missile in 11 days Friday, freeing up $ 950 million that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had withheld from the program because of early test failures. The success also put the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest, deadliest weapon on track for operational deployment at sea in March. `` A nice, safe, easy launch straight down through the countdown,'' said Vice Adm. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Submarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, who observed the test 50 miles off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast. <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> said the launch demonstrated that engineers have overcome nozzle design problems that caused the explosive failure of two of the first three undersea tests in March and August. Because of the failures, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> froze all but $ 250 million of the $ l. 2 billion appropriated for the Trident 2 program in fiscal year 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stipulated the funds would be released when the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> logged three successes of the redesigned missile. That requirement was met when the third straight success was registered Friday, said Lt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Three more submarine test-firings are planned in January and February before the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> goes on operational patrol with 24 of the powerful missiles, each capable of delivering as many as 12 nuclear wearheads to individual targets, <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> said. Twenty-four Trident 2 submarines are planned. The two early failures set the program back, missing the original November operational date. March was set as the new target after the faulty nozzle system was redesigned. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> anti-nuclear protesters were not on the scene Friday as the submerged submarine unleashed the 44-foot, $ 26.5-million missile, which propelled a dummy warhead package to an undisclosed ocean target more than 4,000 miles down the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> tracking range. A large <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> vessel was badly damaged Dec. 4 when a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship rammed it to keep it out of the launch safety zone. A smaller sailboat kept its distance as the protesters staged a silent vigil during a launch Wednesday. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the organization now would take its fight to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to kill the Trident 2 program.

 A decisive election victory gives the new civilian government vital leverage on Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who will keep command of the army after leaving the presidency, but the road ahead is not smooth. President-elect <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> acknowledges he must build careful alliances with conservatives to achieve democratic reforms sought by his center-left alliance. Also, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> appears at least indirectly strengthened in his claim to leadership of the politial right. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> won 55.2 percent of the vote for president Thursday, nearly twice the 29.4 percent of pro-government candidate <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>. A third candidate, entrepreneur <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON>, got only 15.4 percent, according to virtually complete returns released Friday. The 17-party coalition <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> represents won a majority in the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and 22 of the 38 elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats. The consitution <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s government wrote in 1980, however, allows it to appoint up to 10 more senators. His own impressive victory, and the especially good showing of his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demcratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> give <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> `` a strong mandate,'' said <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON>, Latin American studies director at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Thursday's vote demonstrates that `` <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> has broad-based support, which <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> does not,'' <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, where he witnessed the election. `` He can say: ` Look, I got 55 percent. You only got 43 percent.''' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> won 43 percent of the vote in October 1988 on a referendum proposal to extend his presidency to 1997. He lost the referendum and was forced to call the elections, but <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s showing was much stronger than <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>'s in the presidential race. `` For the right, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is the most powerful figure, potentially,'' <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON> said. The fiercely anti-communist general, 74, seized power in 1973, overthrowing elected President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, an avowed Marxist who died in the coup. He is to relinquish the presidency March 11, but has said he will remain as commander of the 60,000-man army. A special clause in the constitution allows him to keep the job until 1998. From the army command, directly across <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s main boulevard from the presidential palace, he plans to lead the military in its role as watchdog of his 1980 constitution. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> also has hinted occasionally that he may return to politics _ because, the general says, Chileans will come to miss his authoritarian leadership. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>'s platform includes several democratic changes in the constitution and in special laws, but majorities of up to two-thirds are needed to pass them. That his coalition failed to achieve such dominance is due largely to complicated electoral laws written by the junta that caused many leftist candidates to lose even when they got more votes than rightist opponents. Parties of the left have considerable influence in powerful labor groups, and <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> will need to make sure they do not feel disenfranchized as he tries to reach accommodation with conservatives. At a news conference Friday, the president-elect seemed well aware of his delicate position. He denied any intention of setting his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> apart from the alliance as a means of wooing moderate rightists known to dislike <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. The alliance will continue to work `` as a team,'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said, and he will follow a `` path of broad consensus'' between now and March 11. He spoke of the peaceful manner in which Chileans are returning to civilian government, and declared: `` In this country, the commitment toward moderation prevails.''

 Twenty-three Koreans on Friday were tearfully reunited with their relatives after arriving from the Soviet island of <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> sent them to work during World War II. The Koreans, ranging in age from 57 to 83, hugged relatives and shed tears when they arrived at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kimpo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for their first visit. They are among thousands sent to labor on <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> when the island was under Japanese control. The Soviets took it over in the closing days of the war in 1945, when <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was liberated from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s colonial rule. This was the first batch of <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> who have visited <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a program initiated in July by South Korean and Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials. The 23 Koreans will return to the Soviet territory after winding up an officially-sponsored two-week stay in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. About 4,000 Korean wartime survivors live on the island, in addition to more than 30,000 Sakhalin Koreans of the second or third generation. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had urged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to establish official channels to help the Koreans on <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> visit their homeland since the communist superpower permitted limited home visits by the <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> in 1986. Although <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has no diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the two countries have sharply improved trade and other relations in recent years. <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION>, a narrow 580-mile-long island, lies about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northernmost island of Hokkaido and straddles the Soviet mainland.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday signed into law new rules for the scandal-wracked <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, saying the regulations will help eliminate flaws that allowed the agency to be `` abused for political purposes or personal gain.'' The legislation, approved by a voice vote in both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, grew out of revelations of fraud, influence-peddling and political favoritism at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The multibillion-dollar scandal has been the subject of congressional and criminal investigations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the measure would `` improve program management and financial accountability at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and make that department's programs less susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse and political influence.'' The bill requires consultants and lobbyists working on <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs to register with the department and identify their clients and fees they receive. Recipients of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants would have to report their use of consultants and lobbyists. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> would be required to publish notices of funding availability, including waivers of regulations as a way to prevent subsidy awards based on insider information. The measure also imposes strict limitations on the use of discretionary funds by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement that `` never again must we let'' the programs of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> or any other agency be `` abused for political purposes or personal gain.'' The law, he said, `` represents a bispartisan approach to correcting many of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s past problems and helping to ensure that in the future that department will better serve those who depend on its programs.'' Other provisions: _ Create a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> chief financial officer's position, as well as a comptroller of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, to oversee financial management _ Apply new restrictions on the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program, which provided subsidies for renovating low-income housing that were at the heart of evidence of influence-peddling and political favoritism in the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandals _ Make it illegal for consultants to sell their influence in securing housing subsidies for a contingent fee or a per-unit fee, as occurred during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration _ Strengthen the secretary's ability to enforce new <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> laws with civil fines against developers, consultants, applicants and mortgage lenders It would restrict the secretary's ability to use discretion in awarding housing assistance.

 An arson blaze this morning on the first floor of a high-rise for the elderly pumped smoke into upper floors, killing three people out of reach of firefighters' aerial ladders, authorities said. After rescuers evacuated the 15-story Midtown Towers in below-zero cold, 77 residents and two firefighters were taken to <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>'s two hospitals, most for treatment of smoke inhalation. Six residents were listed in critical condition. `` A lot of people were hanging out the upstairs windows screaming,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Guilfoyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambulance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was a tremendous amount of flames coming out the front and back end of the building.'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravelle </PERSON> said a door at the base of the building's stairwell jammed, trapping some residents until it was pried open. Most of the dead and injured were reportedly found in stairwells, he said. State fire investigators classified the fire as `` probable arson,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennegan </PERSON> said. He said if this preliminary determination stands, the deaths will be investigated as homicides. Investigators said the fire started shortly after midnight in a first-floor recreation area of the 20-year-old building, which has 150 apartments. More than 100 firefighters from nine departments arrived within minutes and controlled the blaze within an hour. <PERSON> Gravelle </PERSON> said the fire was contained to the first floor, but that smoke quickly spread throughout the building. He said a safety violations helped the fire spread on the first floor _ the recreation room's double doors were left open overnight. One of the dead was found in a hallway and two were found in stairwells on the 12th and 13th floors, beyond the reach of the city's aerial ladders. `` There's not a truck in the world that could reach the top of the building,'' said former <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Damon </PERSON>, adding that the fire truck ladders reach about eight stories. Firefighters led about 200 elderly residents down fire-protective staircases out of the building or through apartment windows to a suspended aerial platform. A shelter was set up nearby for those residents not requiring medical treatment. `` I was asleep with my TV on, and all of a sudden the smoke alarm went on and I got right up,'' said 78-year-old <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Montrois </PERSON> identified the dead as <PERSON> Pansy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON> 88, <PERSON> Eunice </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 88 and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON>, 69, all residents.

<HEAD>Factory Output Little Changed As Sluggishness Spreads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Industrial production was little changed in November despite rebounding from a major strike and a devestating earthquake, the government said Friday in a report that showed spreading economic sluggishness. Many economists said the weak 0.1 percent gain in output _ the first in three months _ accompanied by moderating inflation suggests the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> should permit another drop in short-term interest rates to stimulate the economy. `` Manufacturing production continues to slow _ it's not collapsing, but it is slowing _ and I think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is sensing that it has some type of leeway to ease'' rates, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In its report Friday on industrial production, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> attributed the gain to a rebound from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> strike, which ended in late November, and from the lingering effects in the computer and related industries from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay-area </LOCATION> earthquake in October, when output had slumped 0.6 percent. `` Excluding the impact of these events, the total index would have been little changed in both October and November.'' the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported. The manufacturing sector has been among the hardest hit by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s tight-money policies as the central bank tries to contain inflation by slowing the economy without tipping it into a recession. But in the latest report on inflation, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that wholesale prices dipped 0.1 percent in November, the third decline in five months. Industrial output had not risen since a 0.4 percent gain last August and that followed a 0.1 percent drop in July. It was down 0.3 percent in September. `` Clearly, the manufacturing sector is sluggish,'' contended <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, senior economic adviser for the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` It started in the auto industry earlier this year and spread to other consumer durables,'' he said. `` We're seeing softness in appliances and furniture and, in the last month or so, seeing it show up in the capital goods industry.'' Output at manufacturing plants making both durable and nondurable goods rose 0.2 percent in November after falling 0.8 percent in October and 0.4 percent in September. Production of durable goods _ items expected to last more than three years _ rose 0.5 percent last month after falling 1.8 percent in October and 0.7 percent in September. Nondurable manufacturing fell 0.2 percent after rising 0.5 percent in October and 0.1 percent in September. In another report reflecting sluggishness, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities edged down 0.1 percentage point to 82.7 percent in November to its lowest rate since April 1988. `` That's one of the reasons you're seeing producer prices falling,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON>, economic forecasting director at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` When you have excess capacity, that's when you see price concessions. The closer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and subsequent price increases. Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or above as an indication of inflationary pressures. Factory use had dipped in October to 82.8 percent from 83.4 percent in September. The rate posted 10-year highs of 84.3 percent last December and January.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> led the nation Friday in mourning <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> in a dramatic show of respect for the physicist and human rights champion the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> once subjected to internal exile, force-feeding and <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> harassment. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who won the the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, died Thursday at age 68 in his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> home, apparently of a heart attack, as he prepared for the latest battle in his war for democracy and human rights. A brilliant scientist, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> helped develop the hydrogen bomb. But he sacrificed the perks and honors due a top scientist to pursue a human rights campaign that spanned three decades and made him the conscience of the nation. He lived to see many of his dreams come true and his own people acknowledge his greatness, as the rest of the world had done much earlier. But he died without fulfilling his latest cause: forcing the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to give up its monopoly on power. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who in 1986 freed <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> from nearly seven years in exile in the remote city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>, frequently argued with him in public but was respectful in the end. `` He was not some sort of political intriguer,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> chief told reporters during a break in a session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was a person who had his own ideas, his own convictions which he expressed openly and directly. I valued this in him. This does n't mean I agreed with him, although on many things we did agree.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent a message to <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s widow, fellow human rights activist <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, saying, `` All of us are diminished by his utimely death.'' `` All of us who knew him will never forget his courage and devotion to freedom,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` In the darkest hours of his struggle for human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he embodied all that is good and decent in the human spirit.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> died alone in his study after returning home from a meeting of opposition deputies, where he charged the Soviet hierarchy was leading the country to catastrophe. His body was discovered by his wife. <PERSON> Yefrem </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s son-in-law, said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s last words to his family were: `` Tomorrow there will be a battle'' _ a reference to his plans to press again for an end to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s monopoly on power. He then went to prepare for Friday's session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the parliament to which he was elected this year. The congress formed a committee to organize the funeral. A secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Lebedev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> worked said he would be buried Monday alongside his parents at <LOCATION> Vostryakovskoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he would attend. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s source of strength and his companion during the years of struggle and exile, sat in a chair next to the body Friday. A few close friends were admitted to the study, a separate apartment one floor down from his seventh floor apartment on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Garden Ring Road. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who suffered angina, had looked tired in recent months, which were filled with foreign trips and work as a deputy. Age and poor health curtailed his activities _ he looked far older than his years _ but when he felt he had to speak out, he did. Though he was a poor speaker, with a slight stutter and high-pitched voice, the public had come to know and like <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> so much that an unscientific newspaper poll in October indicated he was the most popular parliamentarian _ outscoring even <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the maverick Communist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. An official statement showed how far the country had come from the days when <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was vilified. `` Everything that he did was dictated by his tireless conscience, his deep humanitarian convictions,'' <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON>, a member of the Presidium of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Communist Party Politburo, said in announcing <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s death to the deputies. Fellow scholar-deputy <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON> told the deputies: `` With <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, a part of our heart has departed from us.'' Human rights activist <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, who spent nine years in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> labor camps before emigrating to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1986, said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> `` helped change the whole climate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s death was `` a great loss for reform both in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and everywhere else.'' `` We needed this man for reforms and for the troubles connected with them,'' he told the Polish <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program brought progress toward the goals <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had set since he turned from nuclear physics to human rights: withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, glasnost _ or openness _ on the country's problems, the right to strike, economic autonomy for factories, amnesty for political prisoners and freedom of emigration. But <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> pressed harder.

 `` I personally respect <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeyevich </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> very much, but it is dangerous to give so much power even to the initiator of perestroika,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in June after it added the presidency to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s job as party general secretary. He said he had no regrets about the difficult path he had followed. `` I am proud of this exile in Gorky like a medal I wear,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was born May 21, 1921, in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and like his father became a physicist. He was inducted into the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in 1953 at age 32, the youngest member ever. In 1948, he joined physicist <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamm </PERSON> in developing the hydrogen bomb and for the next 20 years lived in secrecy with a good apartment, driver, high salary and government awards. But, like <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> began to worry about the morality of developing weapons of mass destruction. He had his first major brush with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> in 1961, when he appealed to Premier <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> to stop testing nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> responded that scientists should n't meddle in politics. Two years later, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to such limits in a treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, horrified at Soviet society's mistreatment of its citizens, said his `` social and political views underwent a major evolution.'' He risked his status and began using his influence for victims of human rights abuses in 1966. The authorities showed their rage in 1968, when <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s `` Progress, Co-existence and Intellectual Freedom'' was published abroad It called for Soviet-American detente long before the concept became part of Soviet foreign policy. He was banned from work on secret projects. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> called the essay `` a turning point in my life'' and two years later he helped found the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. After the 1968 death of his first wife, <PERSON> Klavdia </PERSON>, he married <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> in 1971, and she became his constant companion. He spoke out against repression of dissidents and for democratic reforms. His cluttered one-bedroom apartment became a mecca for troubled Soviets: Crimean Tatars, Volga Germans, political prisoners, religious believers and refuseniks _ Jews denied permission to emigrate. In awarding him the peace prize in 1975, the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> called him `` the conscience of contemporary mankind.'' By 1980, the authorities had had enough. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> condemned the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in an American TV interview and on Jan. 22, 1980, <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents seized him on a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> street. Without charges or a trial, he was exiled to <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>, 250 miles east of the capital, and stripped of his awards. The once-respected scientist spent nearly seven years in the remote city with <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> guards trailing him, searching his apartment and secretly filming him. He was cut off from the world. Despite heart trouble, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was drugged and tied to a bed and force-fed during a hunger strike. `` We wo n't let you die, but we will make you an invalid,'' a doctor warned him. Western governments, scientific and human rights groups pressed the Soviets to release <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. Then in December 1986, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> phoned to say he could return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, restraining his joy at the news to show his concern for others, told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to free all political prisoners. Two months after <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s release, scores of political prisoners were freed and he threw his support behind <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He got his old job back at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and in November 1988 was allowed to travel abroad for the first time, even though <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> could not go to other countries because he knew state secrets. Survivors include a son and two daughters from his first marriage, as well as <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>'s children from a previous marriage: son, <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>, and daughter, <PERSON> Tatiana </PERSON>, who is married to <PERSON> Yefrem </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON>.

<HEAD>East Germans Pour Into West for Christmas Shopping</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of thousands of East Germans hopped onto crowded westward trains or trudged across the border through pouring rain Friday in a rush to do their Christmas shopping in the West. The Communist leadership reminded its citizens that despite their forays into `` consumer paradise,'' some `` hard, sweaty work'' is needed to improve things back home. Since borders were opened Nov. 9, millions of East Germans have poured into the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, lured in part by the 100 marks -LRB- $ 55 -RRB- in `` welcome money'' the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government gives each of them. With Christmas just around the corner, the pace of visitors has picked up, with 320,000 crossing into northern <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> alone early Friday. Tens of thousands more arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Officials in the northern state of <LOCATION> Schleswig-Holstein </LOCATION> and the central state of <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION> were planning to open nine new border crossings to handle the influx. To cut down on the traffic chaos, the new crossings will be limited to those on bicycle and foot. The will to shop was driving some of the visitors to extremes. Dozens waited at the crossing near near <LOCATION> Probstzella </LOCATION>, jumping onto packed trains as they slowed down before entering northern <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlee </PERSON> of the state border police headquarters in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. About 1,100 people could n't get on any train at <LOCATION> Probstzella </LOCATION> and walked into <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> through a driving, nearly freezing rain. Shivering and soaked, the group arrived in nearby <LOCATION> Ludwigstadt </LOCATION>, much to the surprise of local townspeople. `` It's unbelievable what people will do,'' said <PERSON> Schlee </PERSON>, noting there were dozens of children in the group. The now-familiar East German Trabant cars filled parking places in downtown <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> and in other major West German towns along the border. But the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> reminded its readers the shoppers will be returning to the same troubles after their excursions to what it called `` consumer paradise.'' `` The shining mountains of goods in the society of over-abundance have magical attraction,'' the newspaper acknowledged. But it cautioned: `` We will have to live with the reality of open borders but a markedly lower level of productivity and prosperity.'' It will take `` hard, sweaty work'' to minimize the gap between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and its rich Western neighbor, it said. For those thinking of possible reunification, <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON> warned of the `` two million unemployed in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION>, an estimated six million poor as well as the crisis in housing and education.'' East German leaders have been pleading with the people to avoid the temptation of reunification with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. But there are growing indications that a sizeable portion of the country would gladly exchange socialism for some of the shimmer and prosperity of Western capitalism. Despite the new freedom of movement, more than 1,000 East Germans each day are coming to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to resettle permanently.

 OK, so they were about 56 dogs short. But the 45 people dressed in spotted suits masquerading as `` 101 Dalmatians'' were a hit with the crowd Thursday and as they ran along they barked a Christmas carol. Every year, hundreds of runners dress up and jog through the streets in the <ORGANIZATION> Jingle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Run </ORGANIZATION>, a zany event that mixes racing and costume competition. This year's event raised money for a local blood center. One group of runners dressed as a <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> game set, complete with a silver screen and two fighters trying to save Christmas. There was a group of rap-singing and dancing reindeer. There also was a group of `` Christmas seals,'' all wearing brown trash bags and whiskers. And there was a Santa-and-elf duet, with the elf inhaling helium before the two sang `` Jingle Bells.''

 His last words were about continuing the fight. Over a quarter-century <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, 68, pursued his vision of a just, less-brutal society, undaunted by Kremlin vilification, the scorn of his scientific peers and the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. Before anybody but Sovietologists had heard of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> demanded `` glasnost'' _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness. Before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s Kremlin declared a 19-month unilateral freeze on nuclear testing, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> publicly sought a halt to all tests. Long before the Soviet leadership admitted <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s crimes to the world, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was among those few who denounced them, and he noisily sought redress for the victims. The Kremlin this year acknowledged its 1979 invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was a mistake and even a crime, but <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> in 1980 had denounced it, and he paid with nearly seven years of exile. The stooped, rumpled physicist died Thursday, but the future he and other dissidents fought so hard for in the 1960s and'70s has in part come true. For many Soviets, the man who spoke his independent mind in a stammering voice will be irreplacable. `` We have lost our moral compass,'' mourned <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s colleague at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and a fellow member of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. At the height of the dissident era in the 1970s, no cause seemed too small for <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>: Crimean Tatars, Soviet Jews and Germans seeking to emigrate, dissidents and religious activists all found succor and sympathy in his two-room <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment. While others kept silent in the oppression of the pre-Gorbachev era, this honored son of the Soviet regime spoke out against injustice and in favor of individual freedom. He risked his personal fortune, his liberty, his health. The worldwide opprobrium his criticisms brought the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, plus outrage at his 1980 exile to Gorky and brutal treatment there by the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, showed Soviet leaders they could not hope to be fully accepted members of the international community while still repressing their citizenry. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s voice was only one of many raised in protest, but it carried the farthest. In December 1986, when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> telephoned him in <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> to say he could return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, it proved the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, proclaiming greater openness, was now ready to tolerate criticism it once branded anti-Soviet and even treasonous. Many of the causes pursued by <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and the dissidents of the 1970s were won under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, named Soviet leader in March 1985. There are now greater liberties of self-expression, freer emigration, successes in superpower disarmament, mass amnesties of political prisoners. Soviet dissent, however, continues on other themes, from pro-independence political groups in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a self-styled alternative party seeking a British-style parliament. But none of their members has the domestic audience and international reach of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, and other anti-establishment leaders, like maverick Communist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, are considered by many to be demagogues or driven by ambition. A developer of the Soviet hydrogen bomb who later recoiled in horror at what he had wrought, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> could have settled into a comfortable life back in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with his wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, continuing research on the physical properties of the universe. He did so for a while. But his conscience would not let him rest. `` I personally respect <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeyevich </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> very much, but it is dangerous to give so much power even to the initiator of perestroika,'' he declared this summer, after overcoming opposition from the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> to become one of its representatives in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. With growing determination, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> fought against the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional monopoly on power. His status as a deputy meant that for the first time, tens of millions of Soviets heard his views on state-run TV. He had spoken out previously about the abuses of power; now he wanted to alter the very foundations of power. It was to be his last, as yet unsuccessful fight. A nationwide strike <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> called for Monday to force the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact a multiparty system flopped. Led by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the parliamentarians rejected debate on the issue 1,138 to 839. After dinner Thursday, the Nobel Peace laureate left his seventh-floor <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment for his book-strewn office one floor below. He was planning a speech to renew his attack on Article 6, the constitutional guarantee of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rule. His parting words were, `` Tomorrow there will be a battle,'' said son-in-law <PERSON> Yefrem </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON>. It was one of the rare battles of his times that <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> would not take part in. He died alone, apparently of a heart attack. Retiring on his laurels were not for <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. In June, he tangled for the first time with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over breaking the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s legal grip on power. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tried to cut him off, but <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> kept speaking. `` I will continue,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> declared from the podium. He did until the end.

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s main opposition party Friday unveiled its platform for next year's parliamentary elections and promised to fight to preserve the nation's multiparty democracy. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, also said the nation should seek a dialogue with neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON>, 52, was a founder of President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and a secretary-general. But <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> fired him a year ago after <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON> publicly attacked the goverment for alleged widespread corruption. <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON> formed the <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in April, and gained support from students, trade union members and farmers disillusioned with unfulfilled promises of reform made when <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> led the British colony to independence in 1980. The <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> has lost five parliamentary by-elections in government strongholds. But it captured sufficient ballots to raise government fears that <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON> could secure a foothold in the 150-seat parliament in elections next year. A date has not been set for the balloting but it must be held before April 18, the nation's 10th anniversary. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> is one of the few Western-style democracies in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But the aim of <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> has been to establish a one-party state founded on Marxist-Leninist principles. The party is to hold a five-day congress beginning Tuesday and the 4,800 delegates are to debate whether they should stick with their goal of creating a one-party state at a time when most Eastern European countries that were <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s role models are adopting democratic reforms. The <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> would need the support of two-thirds of parliament to change to a one-party system. <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON> said such a system would amount to tyranny. His platform calls for replacing the presidency with the ceremonial post of head of state and a prime minister as the government leader. `` The executive presidency in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> concentrates power in one individual and this dangerous consolidation of power in a single set of hands must be avoided,'' <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON> said at a news conference Friday. He also said <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> should establish contacts with the ruling white minority in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON> said that nation's government deserved recognition for holding talks with black nationalists, capped this week by South African President F.W <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Why not take a lead from <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s government opposes contacts with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>'s platform also calls for an economic policy based on a combination of socialism and free enterprise, and a redistribution of land to benefit the nation's 9 million blacks. About a third of the land now is held by the white minority, which numbers about 100,000. A similar program failed under <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s government when politicians bought up most available farms. <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> should withdraw its 12,000 troops from neighboring <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, where they are guarding trade routes against attacks by guerrillas of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> should open talks with the rebels to stop the attacks.

 A flock of hefty Muscovy ducks has terrorized residents of this quiet retirement community, nipping at their heals, chasing them to their doors and chewing on one woman's dress `` They are mean,'' <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scaccia </PERSON> said Friday. `` They keep after you. They get ugly and want to bite people.'' Her husband fell over a wire fence and cut his finger trying to get away from one.

When she went outside to check her mail Tuesday, she was attacked. The duck crossed a street and chased her to her doorstep. `` He chewed on my dress,'' she said. `` I was trying to get away and I took a terrible fall.'' She took her late husband's cane Friday when she went to the mailbox. `` If anyone comes near me, I'm going to bat them. They're not going to attack me again.

 A cat fancier sued <ORGANIZATION> Orkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exterminating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, accusing the pest control company of poisoning and burying her cat when she had her house fumigated. `` The point of the whole suit is that they need to recognize the value of animals and what animals mean to a lot of people,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, a nurse who filed suit Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

While Ms. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> and a roommate were moving pets out, <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>, a big gray cat, jumped from her roommate's arms and scrambled beneath the house.

 The government, criticized a year ago for holding back public warning of possible terrorist activity, issued a rare advisory Friday saying there could be holiday-season attacks on Americans overseas. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> issued a similar bulletin to airlines, and a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We have enhanced our security system-wide.'' `` We want to be as forthcoming as possible with information of this kind,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> press officer <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>. `` The information we have received constitutes sufficient reason to be concerned and to pass our concern to the American people.'' She said there was `` no information about a specific threat against Americans'' but that the warning was based on `` an increased level of weapons seizures and arrests of persons affiliated with <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> terrorist groups'' in recent weeks. She emphasized that for traveling Americans, `` We are not advising anybody anything. We are not asking or advising people to cancel travel plans. ... We are simply passing on information we feel should be brought to the attention of travelers, who must make their own decisions.'' The government advisory came just six days before the first anniversary of the terrorist attack that blew up <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all 259 aboard as well as 11 people on the ground. In the ensuing investigation, it was revealed that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities had received warnings about the possibility of a terrorist attack but had not made them public, believing they were not necessarily reliable and might unduly spread alarm. This time, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government decided to issue a public advisory at the same time it began briefing foreign governments about such a threat, said a department official who spoke only on condition of anonymity. A brief statement issued by the department cited `` recent reports of movement of Middle Eastern terrorists in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' and suggested `` terrorists may be planning near-term attacks against a variety of targets, possibly including <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. interests.'' It did not say more specifically where attacks might occur, but added: `` If credible, specific information or a threat to the public is received, the Department of State will provide additional information for travelers and other concerned parties.'' In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> advised airlines to step up security on potentially affected flights. `` Certainly it enhances our vigilance,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. But he said he did not believe the alert would impede holiday travel. `` We do have a system in place which we think we can handle the flow,'' he said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Loflin </PERSON> said, `` Largely because of the anniversary we have coming up, and also because of the incredible amount of passenger traffic, we have enhanced out security system-wide. Mostly, this involves using more -LRB- security -RRB- people.'' He declined to give specifics on additional security. Friday's announcement `` is significant because it's the first time I'm aware of that there is a public announcement,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupperman </PERSON>, a terrorism expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank. In the case of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 103, `` we warned some government officials and left the public naked. This time it appears we're not going to get caught in that way.'' The warnings followed a high-visibility mobilization of security forces in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where officers were posted at airports, public buildings and other areas where large numbers of people congregate. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government source said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was the prime focus of American concerns. The warning was triggered in part by the discovery of 440 pounds of explosives Nov. 24 in <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, and the arrest by Spanish police of eight men. French police said the men and explosives had been destined for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Spanish authorities said at least three of those arrested are members of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, an Iran-backed group of extremist Shiites based in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Also raising concern was the arrival of the Christmas season, with a number of anniversaries coming up which terrorists sometimes use as occasions for carrying out violent activities. Besides the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> explosion, other terrorist incidents that have occurred in December include attacks on the airports in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> two days after Christmas in 1985. The department official said the increased number of Americans in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> during the holiday season is additional cause for wariness.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> board has refused to grant the Medal of Honor to a World War II veteran who colleagues claimed was passed over for decoration because he was Jewish, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> official, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, said today. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>, then an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sergeant, had been recommended for the medal by company and battalion commanders. They cited a battle in the jungles of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> in which he was said to have killed more than 500 Japanese soldiers. <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said an `` exhaustive'' two-year investigation into <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>'s claims showed the battle `` did not occur as alleged.'' As for the claim that <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON> was denied the medal because of anti-Semitism, he said, `` I could not find any basis of fact in this.'' <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, was notified Thursday night of the decision and the army presented its findings to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today, <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s decision was first reported today by The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Board officials said the lack of official records, the death of witnesses and the failing memories of those who survived the campaign thwarted their review. But the toughest obstacle was the implausibility that one soldier _ armed with a machine gun, automatic rifle and a carbine _ could inflict such damage singlehandedly. They said <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON> would have needed large amounts of ammunition and would have been able to fire only one weapon while the Japanese returned his fire, forcing him to keep his head down and shoot without taking aim. Board officials said it was most likely <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON> fought well and had inflicted heavy casualties. The story of <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>'s heroics had been largely forgotten until 1986, when during a reunion of the 128th Regiment he fought in, it was learned he had never been recommended for the Medal of Honor. After the war, <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON> traveled the world as a merchant marine for more than 30 years. J.M. <PERSON> Stehling </PERSON>, his company commander, said in a recently notarized statement: `` I personally inspected the battle scene and there were more than 500 Japanese killed or wounded by the actions of Sgt. <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>. His actions were heroic, and he should receive the Medal of Honor.'' In another statement, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a retired major general who was <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>'s battalion commander, said he passed <PERSON> Stehling </PERSON>'s recommendation to Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, chief of staff of the 32nd Division `` Col. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>'s answer was, ` You mean a Jew for the Congressional Medal of Honor?''' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who died three months ago. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, who also is dead, `` just laughed and walked away.'' The board also looked at a handwritten notation on a yellowing photograph that had been removed from the body of a Japanese officer 47 years ago. He said he would commit suicide to atone for having sent into battle `` 600 fine Japanese soldiers -LRB- who -RRB- died because of a solitary <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier.'' Secret Service experts in counterfeiting told Sen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, D-Wis., that the ink and paper of the photograph that recently came to light were consistent with materials used in 1942 They concluded there was no reason to believe the photo was `` anything other than genuine.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s office had interceded on behalf of <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> resident. Of 295 Medals of Honor awarded in World War II, none went to black soldiers. Only two went to Jews, according to the Jewish War Veterans of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> invited <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to lunch Saturday on this sun-splashed French island in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, and residents are expecting a windfall of tourist dollars from the publicity. `` This is a historic situation for <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Marigot </LOCATION>, the capital. `` We have never had two presidents together.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> will hold a two-hour meeting and working lunch at an exclusive sun resort on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>, 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French officials have announced no agenda for the talks, but the two leaders are expected to discuss the latest developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including the reopening of borders between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The French president has cautioned against a push for a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, saying it could upset the European balance of power. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s invitation to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in return for a visit the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> leader made in May to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. On arrival at Princess <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maarten </ORGANIZATION>, the Dutch half of the island, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> are to be flown separately by helicopter to <PERSON> L'Habitation </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Longvilliers </PERSON>, a 253-room luxury hotel and marina at <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cove </PERSON> on the northeastern coast of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>. A helicopter and scores of French presidential gendarmes and army troops patrolled the 150-acre resort grounds Friday, checking incoming cars with a metal detector. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security officers also were making rounds. At the meeting site, workers set up a beachside tent for the leaders and hooked up communication cables. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> wo n't be mixing with residents, <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said, which explains the lack of the usual welcoming banners and bunting in the capital. A few tourist shops, however, were selling Bush-Mitterrand T-shirts. `` There's a little painting up, a little taping up, but basically that's for Christmas,'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. Similarly, on Dutch <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maarten </LOCATION>, there was little evidence of the event, although <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, publisher of The <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, said: `` Everybody is talking about it, of course.'' The island <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> are visiting is a curious mix of French, Dutch and <LOCATION> Carribbean </LOCATION> cultures. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>, with its sidewalk cafes, fashionable boutiques and strolling gendarmes in khaki shorts and kneesocks, has been called a speck of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Technically, it is a sub-prefecture of the French overseas department of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, which has a status akin to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maarten </LOCATION> is part of the autonomous five-island <LOCATION> Netherland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION>. Dutch is the official language, but few people speak it. Nearly everybody speaks English instead, although the Papiamento language is also heard. The French side is 21 square miles and the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> side 16 square miles. Population estimates vary widely, but the 1990 <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Handbook </LOCATION> says there are at least 8,000 in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> and 14,000 in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maarten </LOCATION>. The French have some topless and all-nude beaches; the Dutch, casino gambling. With duty-free shopping and 36 sandy white beaches ringing the island, both sides have been experiencing a tourism boom in recent years, with a corresponding rise in crime and concerns about overdevelopment. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said he thought the island was bound to benefit from having hundreds of foreign newspaper reporters and TV crews covering the one-day summit. `` That exposure throughout the world is very important to tourism'' the mayor said. `` And we cater to the tourist. We do n't have any other income but the tourist trade. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said 600,000 tourists a year visit the French side of the island alone, spending $ 90 million, not counting cruise ship passengers. Americans account for most of the tourist trade.

<HEAD>U.S. Merchandise Trade Deficit Surges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit surged to $ 10.2 billion in October, the worst imbalance in 10 months, as a record level of imports swamped a small rise in exports, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The October deficit was a sharp 19.8 percent higher than the September imbalance of $ 8.51 billion, reflecting a higher foreign oil bill and big increases in imports of food and industrial supplies. Private economists said even discounting the month-to-month volatility in the trade statistics, the October report served to emphasize that the trade woes that have plagued <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> throughout the 1980s will be a principal headache well into the next decade. However, there was better economic news on the inflation front, where prices at the wholesale level posted their third decline in five months. The 0.1 percent November decline reflected a big drop in gasoline costs that offset a rise in food prices. The November price reduction was expected to further ease fears about inflation and give the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> more room to cut interest rates in an effort to keep the economy from dipping into a recession. Some analysts predicted that the central bank could act as soon as next week to cut interest rates slightly, given widespread signs of weakness, especially in manufacturing. In a third economic report, the government said Friday that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s factories, mines and utilities operated at 82.7 percent of capacity in November, a drop of 0.1 percentage point from October and the lowest operating rate since April 1988. Last January, the factory operating rate hit a 10-year high of 84.3 percent as American manufacturers boosted production because of a boom in export sales caused by a drop in the value of the dollar, which made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more competitive on overseas markets. However, export growth has slowed this year and many analysts are predicting it will slow further in 1990, reflecting the fact that the dollar was rising in value for much of this year. When the slowdown in exports is combined with a growing dependence on foreign oil, many economists are predicting that the trade deficit will worsen in 1990 after two years of improvements. `` Until there is a fundamental change in our competitiveness situation, I think we'll see the trade deficit averaging around $ 9 billion a month,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, senior adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic consulting company. `` It is the same old story: Imports are continuing to rise due to oil and the increased attractiveness of foreign products, many of which we do n't produce any more.'' Through the first 10 months of this year, the trade deficit has been running at an annual rate of $ 109.4 billion, down modestly from last year's deficit of $ 118.53 billion. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, senior economist at <LOCATION> DRI-McGraw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, predicted that the deficit for the entire year would be around $ 108 billion but would rise next year to around $ 112 billion. `` Trade is going to be a continuing problem that is not going to go away in a hurry,'' he said. While some administration officials have also conceded that the trade deficit could rise next year, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> issued an upbeat assessment of the country's international performance, noting that the trade deficit is still running at a lower rate than in 1988. `` We're doing exactly the right thing and no changes are necessary at this time,'' said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The overall October deficit of $ 10.2 billion was the largest since a $ 10.8 billion deficit in December 1988. Imports climbed to an all-time high of $ 41.21 billion, 5.1 percent above the September level. Part of this increase had been expected, given the fact that merchants often boost orders at this time of year to restock shelves before Christmas. Among the biggest import increases were an 18 percent jump in foreign agricultural shipments and a 14 percent rise in imports of industrial materials. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foreign oil bill shot up 8.5 percent to $ 4.38 billion as the price per barrel rose 71 cents to $ 17.09. The number of barrels imported daily was essentially unchanged at 8.26 million. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports were also up, by 1.1 percent, rising to $ 31.01 billion with analysts saying the gain would have been even better except for a strike at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> that cut down on production of jetliners. As usual, the biggest deficit in October was recorded with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an imbalance of $ 4.9 billion, almost half of the total for the month, as imports from that country hit a record level. Other large deficits included a $ 1.28 billion imbalance with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, an $ 843 million deficit with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, a $ 783 million deficit with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and a deficit of $ 461 million with the countries of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers on Friday hailed <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> as a pioneer who played a key role in changing Soviet society. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said the ministers expressed a `` deeply felt sense of loss at the passing of <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>.'' He said the allies underscored that <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> `` played an exceptional role personally and who was a symbol for universal democratic values.'' Officials said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> counterparts discussed <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> at the start of the second and last day of their year-end strategy talks at the alliance headquarters. Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> said in view of the Soviet human rights leader's stature it was only `` natural that we reflected for a minute'' on <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s death. `` <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is a man we must remember with much respect for the untiring way he strove for freedom,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> said after the meeting. He called his death `` a loss for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and especially ... for the forces of reform there. For many in the Communist world, this man was a beacon.'' British Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said after the meeting, `` We all feel a very deep sense of loss at the death of Mr. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>.'' `` We should remember today, the great courage which it took in very difficult and dangerous times for him to act and go on acting as the focus, symbol, the spokesman of freedom in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said he was glad <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> lived long enough `` to see substantial progress in the direction which he was pointing his country toward.'' `` And I think in remembering that today we must also express the hope that the torch will be handed on and that work which is not yet completed will be carried forward by people who will rembmer him,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> `` a tremendous force for peace and freedom.'' `` He was as well a courageous pioneer who led the way in the face of great adversity and we are very sad by his passing,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` I think <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> would be pleased if our reflection on his work extended as well to all of those brave men and women, many of them whose names we'll never know, who sacrificed their liberty, indeed their lives, for the freedom of others.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said until the very end, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> pursued `` the causes that meant the very most to him, standing up in parliament for beliefs that may not be fully accepted today, but which will have their day.''

<HEAD>Navy: No Guarantee Pilots Won't Drop on Public Lands Outside Targets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ca n't guarantee pilots wo n't drop bombs outside designated central <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> target ranges, the military said Friday as cleanup of stray bombs on public lands was suspended for the winter. `` Nobody could say that it wo n't happen again,'' said <PERSON> Olin </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Fallon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's malfunction of equipment that could happen ... And there's always human error.'' Capt. <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Rackowitz </PERSON>, commanding officer at <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON> where the nation's fighter pilots train, has said bombs and rockets might have landed outside fenced ranges for the past 30 years because of pilot or equipment error. Or, he has said, they could have skipped along the desert floor after failing to explode upon impact. Bombs, duds and shrapnel that landed as much as one mile outside ranges were being removed or blown up on site in a seven-week cleanup exercise codenamed `` Operation Ugly Baby.'' The ranges begin 60 miles east of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. There are plans to keep some 110,000 acres surrounding the Bravo 16, 17 and 19 ranges closed to the public through the winter in case undiscovered ordnance remains, <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. A team of 150 Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel flown to <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON> to help with the exercise were going home Friday, <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> said. There are no definite plans to enlist such a large group again to help clear away stray bombs, he added. `` It would be misleading to indicate we were finished with this thing,'' <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> said. `` We'll keep plugging away at it, relying on the assets at our base. But basically, we only have five EODs at <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON> permanantly and they have to work on the ranges, too.'' <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> said he expects all the red flagged bombs to be destroyed Friday so the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> does n't leave ordnance exposed during the winter, although people wo n't have access to the lands normally used for hiking, hunting, grazing and off-road vehicles. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sought indefinite closure of the 110,000 acres of land surrounding the bombing ranges because of fears buried ordnance remains undetected and could blow up if disturbed by people or animals. The land will be reopened next summer and ca n't be permanantly closed without congressional approval, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. No injuries have been reported from public contact with any stray bombs, according to <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> who said the cleanup exercise went safely. He said one <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> worker hurt his leg when he fell down a hill, but no other injuries were reported during the sweeps for bombs <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> did n't have statistics on the total amount of ordnance discovered during the exercise that cost the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> several hundred thousand dollars. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recovered more than 2,000 bombs and duds from its Bravo 17 range alone. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was cited by the state of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> for improper disposal procedures of hazardous waste and for failing to notify the state of the cleanup effort that began secretly in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> faces fines of up to $ 10,000 a day per violation if found guilty.

 The 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies eased East-West tension another notch Friday, approving a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to let unarmed <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> aircraft fly over their territory in search of suspicious military activity. The `` Open Skies'' idea originated with President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> more than 30 years ago, at the height of the Cold War, and was revised by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last spring to include surveillance of laboratories. It will be discussed at a NATO-Warsaw Pact meeting in February in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, that also could produce new proposals for further troop reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. At the end of a two-day meeting, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers also agreed to consider proposals by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that the alliance's role be expanded as the threat of military confrontation with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recedes. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Western alliance, said he was confident of eventual agreement on setting up <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> panels to verify troop reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and possibly a role in mediating regional conflicts. The ministers welcomed an unprecedented visit to alliance headquarters by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> for a meeting with <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> on Tuesday. `` I do n't see it paving the way for Soviet membership in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, the former West German defense minister, said he and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> would discuss `` matters of common interest. This is a first contact.'' `` We will have an exchange of views,'' he said, but `` we will not negotiate.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also is expected ito meet informally with ambassadors of the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> foreign </ORGANIZATION> secretary, described the visit as `` a symbol of what's been happening'' in East-West relations. Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> called it a courtesy call, and said: `` I think they are interested in opening lines, and in that context I think it will be quite constructive.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he probably would not pay a similar visit to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact because the seven-nation Eastern alliance has no exact counterpart to <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>. A visit would mean meeting with a Soviet general, which <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> ruled out. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> are to meet in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at the end of January. Their main task will be clearing a path to completion of a treaty on reducing long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent in time for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to sign it at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit in June. A statement concluding the annual winter meeting of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers welcomed political and economic reforms under way in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and urged that `` the progress achieved must be consolidated.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would not say whether he considered the changes irreversible, but declared: `` Everything that we do should be directed to locking in these changes.'' In their statement, the ministers said: `` Many problems remain. The rule of law and democratic government through free elections have yet to be fully institutionalized.'' It also included a caution about Soviet military might: `` We can not ignore the military realities that our alliance continues to face and which lie at the heart of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s security problems.'' On `` Open Skies,'' the ministers said the concept `` has a very special value.'' `` The willingness of a country to be overflown is, in itself, a highly significant political act in that it demonstrates its availability to openness,'' the statement said. Western alliance ministers said the aerial surveillance could be used to ensure compliance with an agreement being negotiated in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to reduce conventional military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They proposed that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> be open to surveillance flights. Countries would be assigned quotas, based on size, prescribing the permitted number of observation flights by unarmed, fixed-wing aircraft. Several flights a month would be allowed over larger countries, and no country could accept fewer than one every three months. On German reunification, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> endorsed statements by the West German foreign minister, <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, renouncing claims to Polish territory that belonged to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> before World War II. He said the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreement affirmed that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s postwar borders were `` inviolable. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ministers supported eventual reunification of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> through peaceful and democratic means. Later Friday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials met with top officials of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s executive body <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, trade representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Portection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. At a joint news conference, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, the commission president, called for more efficient and effective consultation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on changes in the East. `` You said it, fine,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> commented.

<HEAD>Iranians Vote For Nine Parliamentarians, Seen As Test Of Pragmatism</HEAD>

 Iranians braved rain and cold in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and five other cities Friday to choose nine <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members in elections considered a crucial test for President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s pragmatic policies. Hard-liners fear <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s efforts to liberalize the economy and Iranian society will undermine revolutionary fervor and the ideological purity of the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said turnout in five of the six constituencies, including <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, was so great that the 5 o'clock closing time of the polls was extended by two hours. But observers in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> reported low voter turnout. An <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat based in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said the 5 p.m. closing time of the polls was extended to attract last-minute voters in an effort to increase the count. The radio did not provide a figure for voter turnout. But the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said all constituents over 15 were eligible to vote. Candidates chosen by the electorate will represent <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kashan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Karaj </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kerman </LOCATION>, Bandar-Turkman-Kordkui and <LOCATION> Kuhdasht-Chegini </LOCATION> in Parliament. Some of the constituencies are multi-member. Four seats in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> were being contested by 38 candidates, many of them hard-line opponents of <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and his so-called pragmatic policies. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s former seat in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, which he won with a record 1.2 million votes in the last general election in April-May 1988, is one of those vacant. He gave up that seat following his victory in the presidential elections in June. Most of the other vacant seats in the 270-member Majlis, or parliament, were left empty when <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> appointed legislators to posts in his new administration. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s ambitious policies to revive the economy by improving ties with the West to attract badly needed investment and technology are under attack by a hard-line faction led by former Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, who is contesting one of the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> seats, was dumped in August when <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> formed his new government. He is closely linked with Shiite Moslem extremists believed to hold most of the 18 Western hostages _ including eight Americans _ in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He was also involved with militants who carried out suicide bombings against the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1983, killing hundreds of people. Friday's elections are <PERSON> Montashemi </PERSON>'s first major effort to make a comeback. The Majlis is already dominated by radicals of various stripes and further gains by hard-liners in the elections will intensify pressure on <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has been very low-key about the elections. He said Friday after casting his vote that `` these are not the general elections, therefore they lack enthusiasm. But in any case, they are effective.'' His remarks were broadcast on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> TV, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who died June 3, spent much of his time after the 1979 revolution mediating squabbles between hard-liners and pragmatists, and keeping their power in check. The power struggle has intensified since <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> became president and began sidelining his opponents. Apart from <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, a number of other ex-ministers dumped by <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> are standing in the election. This includes former Labor Minister <PERSON> Abulqasem </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarhadizadeh </PERSON>, former Education Minister <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Akrani </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Behzad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabavi </PERSON>, former Commerce Minister <PERSON> Habibollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Asgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Owladi </PERSON>, and former Posts and Telegraph Minister <PERSON> Morteza </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabavi </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said Friday that acts of violence committed by leftist militants in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> against opposition groups raise `` grave doubts'' about the Sandinista government's willingness to hold fair elections. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> spoke to reporters after outlining his concerns about the Nicaraguan electoral process to Organization of American States Secretary General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> has election observers in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The administration has criticized the Sandinista government on an almost daily basis of late for alleged abuses against opposition supporters. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> that the recent spate of Sandinista violence `` is part of a systematic pattern that raises grave doubts about the intentions of the Nicaraguan government.'' He said the Nicaraguan government is at a crossroads: `` It can hold free and fair elections and thereby advance the process of national reconciliation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Or it can endanger the peace process and the sanctity of the electoral process by intimidation and violence against the opposition,'' he said. On Thursday, members of a bipartisan panel gave President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a firsthand account of bloodletting last weekend that they said was caused by <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> supporters wielding machetes. <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, called the violence `` an isolated incident'' and said the opposition has held more than 50 peaceful rallies since campaigning began. National elections are set for Feb. 25.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday announced some major provisions of the 1990 program for flue-cured tobacco. The federal marketing quota will be 877.7 million pounds, down from this year's 890.5 million, said Undersecretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON>. The 1990 average yield goal will remain at 2,088 pounds per acre. Next year's national acreage allotment will be 420,354 acres, down from 426,485 in 1989. For each farm, the 1990 basic quota and allotment will decrease about 1.5 percent from 1989. <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON> said the effective quota for 1990, which takes into consideration previous undermarketings and overmarketings, will be about 939 million pounds, up 35 million pounds from the 1989 effective quota. The price support level for 1990 flue-cured tobacco will be $ 1.488 per pound, up 2 cents from this year, he said. Further details, including next year's `` no-net-cost assessment'' and the amount of reduction under the Gramm-Rudman budget reduction law will be announced later. Flue-cured tobacco farmers approved acreage-poundage quotas last January for crops in 1989 through 1991.

<TEXT>
 The four clock faces on Big Ben clanked to a halt for three hours Friday, and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s heart seemed to skip a beat. The government agency that services <PERSON> Big </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> and other state buildings throughout the country said the clock stopped at 11:07 a.m. and was out of action until about 2:15 p.m.. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, speaking anonymously, said the cogs that advance the clock's hands were unable to turn even though the pendulum continued to swing She could not explain what caused the malfunction. Big <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> is the name of the 13 -LCB- - ton bell, which chimes out the hours from behind the clock faces Stoppages are rare for the giant 131-year-old clock tower, which has survived pollution, foul weather and war. The British <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> uses the chimes to introduce its 6 p.m. and midnight newscasts, taking the sound live by microphone from the tower. Its other newscasts use the atomic clock at <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>. In December 1986, it lost a note in the quarter-hour chimes because of a broken connecting rod. The following month, the hammers that strike its famous bongs that tell listeners the hour froze up in chilly weather. Windshields were erected to warm up the clock's mechanism and get it back on tune. The 20-story clock tower stands over the <ORGANIZATION> Houses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and one legislator took advantage of the latest stoppage to poke fun at the policies of the governing Conservative and opposition Labor parties during a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> debate on socialism. `` Far be it for me to defend socialism or whatever brand or variety the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is talking about,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of the centrist Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. `` I just can not help but reflect, however, as I walked in that Big <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> had stopped.'' Although `` time has run out on socialism,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the clock also seemed to have `` stopped on the conservatism of this government.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted Friday to fire a law firm because it lobbies for <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Christiani </PERSON>, a day after four partners and one associate lawyer resigned from the firm for the same reason. `` After individual and collective soul-searching, we decided that this was the best thing to do,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Franzen </PERSON>, one of the partners who resigned from <ORGANIZATION> O'Connor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON> on Thursday. The council voted 10-2 to drop the law firm effective Jan. 15, ending a $ 500,000 a year legal contract. After the slaying of six Jesuits last month in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a group of protesters organized under the banner of the <ORGANIZATION> O'Connor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hannan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> persuaded a majority of the council to support a resolution co-sponsored by Council Members <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a primary author of the resolution to end the city's contract with <ORGANIZATION> O'Connor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON>, called the lawyers' resignation `` a courageous decision. The other partners who quit are <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrann </PERSON>, whose office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, represents the Salvadoran leader, <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> and associate lawyer <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>. The five, who make up the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> office's lobbying division, are among the best-known legislative lobbyists in the state. O'Connor & amp; <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON> represents many public bodies, including a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> city agency. <ORGANIZATION> O'Connor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON> has said it did not do legal work for <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and provided only public relations and congressional lobbying, arranging meetings for Salvadoran officials with key federal lawmakers and journalists. A spokesman for the law firm did not immediately return a phone call Friday. <PERSON> McGrann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franzen </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday the decision to resign came after some clients had voiced their uneasiness with the firm's link to <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, and the lawyers' own personal and professional convictions compelled them to quit. `` The clients said, ` We keep reading about your law firm every day and we do n't like what we're seeing. We're uncomfortable about that,''' <PERSON> McGrann </PERSON> said. `` The whole thing led to making it very difficult for us to do the kind of work we do, generally in the public sector, without it impacting our clients. Or at least our clients felt they were being impacted.'' <PERSON> Franzen </PERSON> said the group plans to establish a law firm `` and continue serving our clients as best we can.'' `` We want to state our belief ... that Mr. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has a right to counsel and that right extends to lobbying the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' But, the lawyers said, they did not want to be involved in that effort and were unable to convince the firm to drop <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>.

 Art <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> wants $ 5 million to teach <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> a lesson, his lawyer said Friday. The columnist claims the studio stole his script idea and turned it into the movie hit `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Paramount took <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON>'s idea titled `` King For A Day'' and transformed it into the 1988 <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> comedy, which grossed more than $ 150 million, the lawyer said in opening arguments of the trial, being conducted without a jury. `` We seek substantial punitive damages to teach Paramount and others like it a lesson not to treat creative people like this ever again,'' said attorney <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, the attorney said, already has netted $ 22 million from the film and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> collected more than $ 50 million in distribution fees. But, he said, the studio refused to pay <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> and producer <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernheim </PERSON> $ 250,000 plus a small share of profits under their original contract. `` Sadly, the evidence shows that even a towering literary figure like <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> is prey to an unscrupulous major movie studio,'' the attorney said to Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. An attorney for Paramount, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Draper </PERSON>, ridiculed the idea that <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON>'s script idea was plaigarized. He said it was different and that it never occurred to <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanen </PERSON>, the head of the studio, that there was any similarity between the two ideas, both of which dealt with an African prince coming to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Draper </PERSON> acknowledged that during the year in which the case was pending, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> _ who is not a party in the lawsuit _ admitted that he had seen <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON>'s proposal. But <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said he could n't tell whether it influenced him subconsciously in writing his own script for `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` What they're claiming, I think, is that <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> did n't intentionally rip them off But in his subconscious, he ripped them off,'' <PERSON> Draper </PERSON> said in his opening statement. A <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, man, <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Armour </PERSON>, filed a $ 40 million lawsuit in January against <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, claiming the movie's plot was stolen from him and writer <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> also has claimed the story as his.

 The Communist Party proposed a multiparty system, free elections and full membership in Western economic institutions, including the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, according to a declaration drafted Friday. `` The end to the authoritiarian socialism has come,'' said the declaration, which also called for constitutional guarantees to bring market-oriented economic reform, establish an independent judiciary and protect human rights. The document, prepared for adoption at next month's national party congress and published by the <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> daily, appears to be <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s reply to the wave of democratic reforms currently sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The communist party of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> supports freedom of assembly, speech and all other civil liberties, regardless of political convictions of individuals,'' said the document released by a preparatory committee. Political `` associations, movements or parties will depend on the will of the citizens, whose freedom of choice must be guaranteed by the constitution,'' the declaration stated. It said that the communist party will no longer retain its monopoly on power and will participate along with other parties in `` free, direct and secret elections.'' `` We are changing all of this now in order that tomorrow will not be too late for socialism in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>,'' the document stated, adding that the reforms should be implemented within six months after the congress. Until now, the Communist leadership of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> was the staunchest opponent of Western-style democracy in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. But at its congress on Friday <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> appeared to have softened its hard-line stance Communists and Serbian authorities `` have no reason or wish to administratively impede the establishment of -LRB- independent -RRB- political parties'' in the republic, said <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Trifunovic </PERSON>, the region's party chief, in his keynote address. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s rejection of Western-style democracy has been shared to date by <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s military, which contended that opposition parties would be formed along ethnic lines, thus fueling ethnic tensions. However, Gen. <PERSON> Ivo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tominc </PERSON> on Friday was quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency as saying that `` the army would not stand in the way of the country's democratic development'' and that it would `` adjust itself to the changes in the society.'' The second-largest republic of <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> and liberal northern <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> have already endorsed parliamentary democracy and are both scheduled to hold free legeslative elections next spring.

<HEAD>Administration Decides To Put Hold On EPA-Corps Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> that would have begun to carry out President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign pledge to preserve wetlands will be held up for 30 days, the administration announced Friday. The two agencies `` will use the extension to allow for explanations and discussion with federal agencies that have raised concerns about the agreement,'' and to `` clear up any misunderstandings about the purpose of the memorandum,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The memorandum of agreement, which was reached in early November and scheduled to take effect Friday, has caused a split within the administration. The departments of Energy and Transportation oppose the agreement and the Council on Environmental Quality and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> are in favor. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denied reports that the agreement had sparked a fight in the department between the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said `` The only concerns we have are procedural.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had promised during the campaign to strive for a goal of `` no net loss'' of wetlands. In a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> said the way in which the White House handles the EPA-Corps agreement `` will demonstrate whether or not you are truly commited to a national wetland policy of no net loss.'' `` There is no middle ground on this one. It's either up or down,'' wrote <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hair </PERSON>. The agreement has faced stiff criticism from the oil industry in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> congressional delegation, who fear it could disrupt oil and gas production on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION> and cripple that state's economy. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> has threatened to sue if the agreement is n't changed. Many conservationists have grown increasingly concerned about the disappearance of wetlands such as swamps, bogs, marshes, potholes on the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and tidal estuaries. According to some estimates, up to 400,000 acres of wetlands per year have been lost in recent decades to housing devlopments, farms, shopping centers, highways and other encroachments of a modern economy. But wetlands buffer floods, purify streams and provide wildlife habitat for many species that ca n't life elsewhere. Federal law requires that the Corps grant a permit before developers may put fill in most wetlands. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> may challenge the decision and has certain veto powers over it, and the two agencies frequently had been at odds. The <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> agreed in the memorandum to `` strive to avoid adverse impacts and offset unavoidable adverse impacts to existing aquatic resources, and for wetlands, will strive to acheive a goal of no overall net loss of values and functions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, in its statement, said the memorandum `` does not define a ` no net loss' policy, but rather establishes a clear sequence of actions to be considered in the -LRB- existing -RRB- permit-review process.'' Under the agreement, permit applicants would first have to seek alternatives to disturbing wetlands and if none were available would have to work to minimize damege to wetlands. If the project would still cause significant harm, the applicant would have to compensate for the loss, perhaps by building new wetlands or restoring, old, already damaged areas.

<HEAD>Bribery Trial Begins For Two Execs, Two Politicians</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, accused of bribing officials by selling them cut-rate stock shares, went on trial Friday along with a former aide and two politicians in a scandal that toppled two governments. <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, whose publishing conglomerate became the name of the scandal, told Judge <PERSON> Tadatsugu </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> and a team of some 20 prosecutors that his gifts of discount shares and cash to influential public figures were not meant as bribes. The 53-year-old <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> and former Recruit executive <PERSON> Toshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, 39, both said they had `` absolutely no intention of bribery,'' but apologized for the trouble resulting from the Recruit scandal, which brought down two prime ministers and has severely shaken public confidence in the nation's leadership. <PERSON> Takao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, a former key Cabinet minister, and <PERSON> Katsuya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON>, formerly a lawmaker with the opposition Komeito -LRB- Clean Government -RRB- party also pleaded innocent to receiving bribes from Recruit but begged forgiveness for getting involved in the scandal. If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to five years in prison. Their trial is the last of five trials against 12 executives and ex-public officials that began last month as the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> delves into allegations of corruption in the nation's elite. The Recruit scandal, which began in the summer of 1988, brought down Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and his successor, Sousuke Uno. Coupled with an unpopular sales tax, it remains a serious problem for the governing conservative party, which faces a general election sometime next year. In the packed courtroom Friday, <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> responded to prosecutors' accusations by denying that he provided political donations and cut-rate shares to <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> as bribes to win favors from them Prosecutors must prove the intention of bribery in order to get convictions. Along with the other three defendants, he accused prosecutors of forcing him to admit to bribery charges under duress. `` The prosecutors questioned me from morning to night. When I tried to close my eyes they forced me to keep them open to the point that they hurt so bad that tears were flowing,'' he said. `` I was questioned for over 20 hours and suffered physical and mental damage,'' said <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>'s former aide <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, who also protested his innocence. <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> is being tried on seven counts of bribery and <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> on two counts. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, 57, who was chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary when <PERSON> Recruit </PERSON> was allegedly seeking to win special treatment for its fast-growing employment-information and telecommunications businesses, admitted he received from Recruit $ 140,000 and 10,000 shares in its real estate subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION>. But he said he did n't personally accept the gifts or provide special favors to <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>. `` I would never think of doing that in my position as chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary,'' <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> said in his brief statement. Due to his involvement in the scandal, <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> has left the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but retains his seat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Recruit offered millions of discount shares in Recruit-Cosmos to hundreds of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen before the stocks were available to the general public. When the shares hit the over-the-counter market, their price shot up and the insiders made big profits. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>'s shares were said to have earned him $ 215,000. <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> said Friday he had no idea the stocks would become so valuable after their release to the public. <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON>, 52, who resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> over the scandal, vehemently denied having any connection with Recruit and said he had not personally accepted $ 49,000 in political donations or the 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares supplied to his brother. Prosecutors' charges that he gave speeches in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> as a favor to Recruit were `` absolutely untrue,'' <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> said. `` I gave those speeches on my own initiative and based on my personal convictions.'' Prosecutors presented hundreds of pages of evidence against the four defendants in the trial, which is expected to drag on for years as the legal system considers the fine line between cordial business-government ties and outright corruption.

 Moslem separatists celebrating the release of five radicals in exchange for a government minister's kidnapped daughter hurled gasoline bombs at police Friday in clashes that killed five people Curfews were imposed in five towns of the northern state of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> after widespread violence and to stop Moslem separatists from demonstrating after Wednesday's swap. Security forces were told to shoot violators. Officials said two people were killed and 30 others were injured in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, the summer capital of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> with a population of 700,000. The Moslem-majority state lies on the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border.

In <LOCATION> Shupiyan </LOCATION>, crowds burned a forest office building and attacked police contingents. Police fatally shot three men and wounded 30 others, said Divisional Commissioner <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pandit </PERSON>, a senior government official. Curfews were imposed in <LOCATION> Sopore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baramullah </LOCATION> on Thursday after separatist violence left two teen-agers dead and 50 others injured. Security forces were ordered to shoot curfew violators Friday, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said. Soldiers have been posted in all five towns, he said. Five militants of the <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> were released Wednesday in exchange for the <PERSON> Rubaiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, held hostage since her abduction by the separatist group Dec. 8.

Prime Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said the release of the militants was not `` bowing to terrorists,'' but a decision that took into account `` the overall situation.'' He said the new government, formed Dec. 2, will assess the situation in the state but was not in favor of precipitate action becuase `` it is a delicate situation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, formed in 1965, wants <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> to secede from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and become either independent or merge with <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

Hindus account for about 80 percent of the population. <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>, the northwestern region of the state, is claimed by both <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and the two countries have fought three wars over the territory since gaining independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. A cease-fire line monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> separates the state into Indian and Pakistani territory.

 Three infants abandoned in the area in 10 days, including one found with a poignant note, may have been left by their parents because of financial and emotional pressures of the season, specialists said Friday. `` It would seem that somebody who abandons a newborn is somebody who's totally overwhelmed and feels they have no resources,'' said <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldenberg </PERSON>, a family psychologist at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Neuropsychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` Abandoning a baby is a case of pure panic. It's like a suicidal impulse.'' The three infants, now in foster homes, seem to support findings that child abandonment has grown as much as 300 percent since 1980. On Wednesday, a 5-month-old boy was found behind a state <ORGANIZATION> Disability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> building along with a note that said, `` Dear friends, please look after my son. ... I simply ca n't give him the kind of care he deserves I know you can.'' It was written by the father, who signed his name but has not been located. The same day, a man who stepped into the morning cold to get his newspaper found a newborn girl wrapped in blue cloth and placed inside a cardboard box in a gutter. Hospital workers named the infant <PERSON> Noel </PERSON>. A girl believed to be 2 to 3 days old was found Dec. 7 at a motel in suburban <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuys </PERSON>, apparently left on a bed by a young couple who told the hotel desk they needed to rent a room briefly, police said. The only clue to her identity was the paper hospital gown decorated with pink-and-blue teddy bears she wore. While experts do n't see a rise in child abandonment during the holiday season, they say that a time of merriment and celebration of family unity can prompt feelings of severe depression and hopelessness fron those without support. People who give up their children in hopes that a stranger will give them a better life may be relying on the Christmas spirit of giving, said <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzini </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> program of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` People may feel others are more generous at Christmas,'' she said. `` They count on the spirit of goodwill.'' As police officers searched for the parents of the three foundlings, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> social workers on Friday held the annual Adoption Day, on which 25 families received adoption decrees for 28 children. Many public and private agencies offer adoption services where parents can surrender children they are unable to care for, but people continue to abandon children anonymously because they are ashamed of their inability to raise the child, said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>. The bureau places abandoned children in foster homes. `` It is so much more socially negative to make that move,'' he said. `` It's somehow more permissible to leave a child with a note. Maybe what goes on in the mother's mind is that she takes this step because of the social stigma that she's not a good mother.'' <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said although babies being left on doorsteps get far more publicity, many parents leave their children with strangers or relatives and disappear, only to return later to claim the child. `` It seems like drugs are playing a big part in that phenomenon,'' <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said. `` We see children abandoned because a parent is so caught up in their drug involvement they ca n't attend to the needs of their children.'' After children are placed in foster homes or relatives are given custody, the parent returns to be reunited with his or her child, only to disappear again later, he said. `` Often they are locatable, which leads you to conclude that they want to be found,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Pizzini </PERSON>. `` That biological tie is there through thick and thin.''

 The roads and hillsides winding through <ORGANIZATION> Antietam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battlefield </ORGANIZATION> are to be softly lit Saturday night with 23,110 candles, one for each soldier killed, wounded or missing after the Civil War's bloodiest battle. `` It's a memorial and Christmas is the season of lights. We just thought it would be a good time to stop and reflect,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rambur </PERSON>, battlefield superintendent, said Friday. `` Everybody talks about 23,000, but not very many people really have an idea of how many that is.'' Up to 5,000 automobilies are expected to join a 4.5-mile tour of the battlefield near <LOCATION> Sharpsburg </LOCATION>, about 70 miles west of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Candles glowing inside lunch-sized paper bags filled with sand will outline the roadways and others will dot the snow-covered 3,200-acre battleground. More men were killed or wounded at <LOCATION> Antietam </LOCATION> on Sept. 17, 1862, than on any other single day of the Civil War. Union losses were 12,410 and Confederate losses totaled 10,700. It was the single bloodiest day of American military history. `` You're really going to get an impression of what kind of impact that was,'' <PERSON> Rambur </PERSON> said. `` When they drive through here, they're going to feel something, I'm sure.'' In addition to the bags of lighted candles, choirs will be singing at various spots in the battlefield, including the <ORGANIZATION> Dunker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the focal point of repeated clashes as both armies sought to occupy and control high ground at the site. A Civil War-era encampment, complete with uniformed re-enactors, recaptures the atmosphere of a wintertime camp 127 years ago. The soldiers will gather at <ORGANIZATION> Bloody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lane </ORGANIZATION>, a sunken road near the center of the battlefield where four hours of fighting left more than 5,000 dead or injured. Neither side gained a decisive victory in the Battle of <LOCATION> Antietam </LOCATION>, but the conflict climaxed the first of Confederate general <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s two attempts to carry the war into the North. The battle also gave President <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> an opportunity to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed all slaves in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1863. An estimated 500 volunteers from church and civic groups, historical organizations, scouting troops and area businesses have assembled the lights, said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Tourism Director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. The battlefield was divided into 23 grids and groups assigned to each section are responsible for arranging and lighting 1,000 candles and retrieving them after the five-hour display. All 23,110 tapers will be lit in the 30 minutes between dusk and dark, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` We do n't know of any -LRB- battlefield -RRB- where this has been done to this magnitude,'' he said. <PERSON> Rambur </PERSON> said organizers are encouraging volunteers to maintain a somber attitude while lighting the candles. `` This is a memorial and we're trying to stress that. We do not want <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clauses </LOCATION> and that kind of thing,'' <PERSON> Rambur </PERSON> said. `` If we learn anything from the battlefields, it is that there just has to be another answer to war.''

 The last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops sent to restore order on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> after Hurricane Hugo began pulling out Friday, an official said. All 170 members of the 276th and 471st <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> military police units will leave the island by Saturday, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Maj. <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Phipps-Barnes </PERSON>. The National Guardsmen arrived a month ago to take over from 1,100 federal troops sent by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> three days after the Sept. 17 storm to restore order and stop looting. The storm destroyed most buildings and homes here and caused $ 1 billion in damages. Due to a near complete absence of local authority, for three days following the hurricane looters cleaned out most businesses and food stores. A senior officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, who asked not to be identified, said local police and Guardsmen could handle security on the island now. `` There is no need for outside troops to be on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>,'' he said. The stateside units helped local officials in joint patrols and maintaining an 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, in effect since the storm. The withdrawal of the 1,100 troops ordered by Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> in November outraged business leaders and the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, who asked the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to keep the troops there until power and telephones were restored.

 A circuit judge has ruled that the city's year-old loitering ordinance, aimed at street drug dealers, is unconstitutional The law is vague and overbroad, and violates the Fourth and 14th Amendments of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution, <ORGANIZATION> Brevard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoon </PERSON> decided this week.

 A Catholic gubernatorial candidate's switch to a pro-abortion stance prompted <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops Friday to criticize politicians who personally oppose abortion while tolerating it publicly. `` We can not judge the state of anyone's conscience before God. We control no votes except the ones we cast personally,'' said a statement read by <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> Archbishop <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> at a news conference at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION> in Chains Cathedral. `` But it is clear to us that, objectively speaking, the tolerance of abortion in our society and the refusal to allow religious and moral principles to influence public life are positions which are both morally and socially wrong,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> group's statement was prompted by gubernatorial candidate Attorney General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s change from an anti-abortion to pro-choice public position. <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON>, a Democrat and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, announced his position switch Dec. 2, then announced his candidacy for governor Monday. He said he still personally opposes abortion. Many politicians have grown fearful of jeopardizing their candidacies with anti-abortion stands. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last month, an underdog <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the state <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> won a narrow victory after a bishop barred her from taking communion because of her support for abortion rights. <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> was followed by anti-abortion pickets this week as he opened his campaign for the 1990 Democratic nomination with appearances in 14 cities. Concluding his tour Friday in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, he said he values the bishops' opinion but sees abortion as an issue of individual vs. government choice. `` I respect the bishops tremendously,'' <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> said. `` The question here is what makes good public policy. I think we need to do a lot more to prevent unwanted pregnancies. `` I strongly oppose abortion. The issue that people are reacting to ... is who makes that decision. I believe it's an intensely personal decision to be made by the woman with the advice of a doctor, family, friends, whomever. But the government should not make that decision.'' <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, which includes bishops from all of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s six dioceses. He said the statement, which did not refer to <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> by name, was intended for all holding or seeking public office. `` This is not just addressed to Mr. <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON>. ... One might say that Mr. <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> was the occasion of it, but he was not the cause of it,'' <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It's intended for all those to whom it applies. It's intended to teach what the church teaches, and it's intended to teach those in public life that they should not attempt to divorce moral principle from public policy.'' Signing the statement with <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> were the other diocesan bishops in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>: <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ottenweller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Steubenville </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilla </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. The statement was also signed by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Pataki </PERSON>, bishop of the Eastern Rite church in <LOCATION> Parma </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Puscas </PERSON>, head of the Romanian Rite church in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>.

 A six-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> delegation returned Friday from secret meetings with <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and said they had seen a nation trying to resist intimidation by a handful of cocaine traffickers. The congressmen praised <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> for his courage as a rash of bombings and assassinations masterminded by drug lords and chips away at the Colombian judicial system. `` You have to be there to understand the kind of fear that we saw,'' Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, told reporters. `` <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is indeed a battlefield,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who noted <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s desire for American help in attacking money laundering, reducing the demand for cocaine and keeping assault weapons from entering the country. All agreed that despite death threats against top Colombian officials, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should go ahead with plans to attend a Feb. 15 drug summit in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to demonstrate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s battle. `` We will collect our forces in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to provide the type of resources that will be necessary to make this war victorious,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who led the visit, which was requested by Barco and supported by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will take our struggle to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to our allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said. The lawmakers, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also met with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s defense and justice ministers, the national police director, the attorney general, Colombian presidential candidates and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>. `` In our meetings with them, it was apparent their determination and the determination of the courts was there'' to apprehend drug traffickers and clamp down on the production of cocaine and crack, said Rep. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON>, R-Pa., the ranking Republican on the committee <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, the panel's chairman, was joined by Reps. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. Aides kept the two-day trip secret out of concerns that the congressmen could become the targets of cocaine traffickers, who have been blamed for a rash of violence that has wracked <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the capital Among those killed have been 50 judges, two newspaper publishers, the chief of the narcotics police and a leading presidential candidate. A bombing earlier this month wounded an estimated 1,000 people. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Sept. 28-29 for discussions with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cooperation with the war on drug traffickers he declared three months ago. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has asked the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government to extradite suspected traffickers indicted in this country on drug charges.

 Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON>, who has a history of arrests on drug-related charges and traffic violations, was held briefly Friday for investigation of drunken driving. Ms. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, 44, refused a sobriety test until after her arrest and until she had spoken to <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, police said. She was arrested after allegedly making an illegal U-turn, said Sgt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. The arresting officer smelled alcohol on her breath, police said, but they refused to release the results of the sobriety test she finally took. She received no special treatment and had to wait in line to be booked at the <LOCATION> Wilshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> police station, police said. She was released about two hours after her arrest after police found she had no outstanding warrants. An arraignment was scheduled Jan. 5 in traffic court. `` I was picked up at <LOCATION> Pico </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Crenshaw </PERSON> for being under the influence of alcohol,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> told reporters after being released. `` This has happened before.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s previous run-ins with the law include guilty pleas to felony counts of driving while under the influence of PCP, possession of PCP and injuring another person in 1983. She was placed on probation and ordered to enter a drug rehabilitation program.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition activist <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said Friday that if he is elected <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s first non-Communist president in four decades he will try to prevent a Communist witch hunt. `` There must be justice, but not revenge,'' said <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, the playwright and leader of the opposition Civic Forum, in an interview with the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would try my best to avoid a witch hunt in this country. Including Communists.'' His comments followed word of a deepening split inside the ruling party between hard-line and reform-minded members that could lead to the establishment of a new democratic party. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has 1.7 million members, all of them are our compatriots and there are countless people among them who are among the same as we are and who want this country to live in democracy,'' said <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Prevratil </PERSON>, spokesman for the recently founded reform <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> group <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> that next week's party congress `` will show whether this movement can live inside the Communist Party.'' Reform members of the party are anxious to distance themselves from the discredited regime of ex-party chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and former hard-line President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who resigned last Sunday after swearing in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s first government not dominated by Communists in 41 years. Since then, a dispute has developed over how to elect the president. Under the constitution, the president is to be chosen by the parliament within two weeks. But the Communist-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is reluctant to vote for <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, and is considering a proposal to throw the election open to popular vote. Negotiations are under way to resolve the dispute between the opposition and leaders of the Communist and other smaller parties. A final resolution is not expected until after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes Dec. 19 and an extraordinary party congress is held next Wednesday and Thursday. The interview with <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> is the first in a series to be conducted by the state news agency, which is moving toward greater independence from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` The real presidential campaign has begun,'' the agency said, adding that interviews would be conducted with all those considered leading contenders. These include <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, architect of the `` Prague Spring'' reforms who was ousted in 1969 after the Soviet invasion; <PERSON> Cestmir </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisar </PERSON>, the student candidate for president in 1968, later expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s prime minister until Nov. 7. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said he did not want the race to `` drive a wedge'' between himself and <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> or between Czechs and Slovaks. He said his priority, if elected, would be to `` guard the quiet, peaceful and dignified nature of the social movement, which some call a revolution'' and not let it be sullied by `` intrigue, politicking and all kinds of dirt.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, television's sharp-tongued comedy mom of the 1980s, called off her January wedding, saying in a terse statement Friday that her boyfriend was in a drug rehabilitation clinic. `` My January 20 marriage to <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> is off,'' Miss <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> has entered an alcohol and drug rehabilitation clinic.'' The statement was the only comment from the star of `` Roseanne,'' said her publicist <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasteler </PERSON>. The name and location of the rehabilitation clinic was confidential and the type of addiction was n't disclosed. The temperamental Miss Barr, 36, recently protested the firing of <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION>, a writer and comic, as a consultant to the show. The couple went to great lengths in recent months to express their devotion during appearances together on TV shows. During taping of `` A Current Affair'' in August, <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> dropped his pants and exposed a backside tattoo reading, `` <PERSON> Rosey </PERSON>.'' In a November Redbook interview, <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> said he and Miss Barr planned to marry and move into a large house, `` big enough so that <PERSON> Rosey </PERSON>'s kids can comfortably live there, as well as any others we might have.'' <PERSON> Kasteler </PERSON>, who has spoken for the couple for months, said she did not know where <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> could be reached for comment. Miss <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>'s first motion picture outing, `` She-Devil'' with <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>, placed fourth in this week's box office derby with a disappointing $ 3.5 million take.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> wants to prohibit manufacturers from using the word `` hormone'' on the labels of nonprescription skin products. Labeling such as `` hormone cream'' implies that the product has a therapeutic effect by altering the structure or function of the body, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. However, the agency said that while nonprescription skin creams can contain hormones, they are at low levels that have not been shown to have any therapeutic effect. Under the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed ban, manufacturers could not refer to their products as `` hormone creams'' or say they contain `` hormones.'' But they would be allowed to include in their regular listing of ingredients the names of hormones in the product, as long as they are not listed prominently. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has published the proposal in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> but a final rule is not expected to be issued for a year, a spokeswoman said. The ban would take effect six months after the final rule is published, but the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is asking manufacturers to comply voluntarily with the proposal before the rule becomes final.

 Up to 30 inches of new snow and intense cold iced roads and closed hundreds of schools Friday from the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> to the Appalachians, and even forced postponement of a ceremony to dedicate an airport's new snow removal equipment. Temperatures hit record lows in more than two dozen cities in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, and the wind chill effect at <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was 49 degrees below zero. The official low for the lower 48 states was 30 degrees below zero at <LOCATION> Chadron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, and at 2 p.m. the temperature at <LOCATION> Lemmon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, was still only 11 below zero, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We're draining all the cold weather out of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territories </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecaster <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Vermoch </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We're bringing it right down the pipe.'' Up to 30 inches of snow fell in northeastern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Door </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in two days, with 25 inches in the same period around <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. Generally 3 to 6 inches fell during the night and through Friday from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, with storm watches posted into Saturday in the Northeast. And snow had begun falling from southwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. In addition to the heavy snow at <LOCATION> Sheridan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, lesser amounts fell elsewhere in that state and up to 18 inches fell in the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>. Schools were closed Friday in parts of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. One <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> school closed for lack of heat. Numerous school, business, social and sporting events were canceled. Two deaths were blamed on the snow and slippery roads in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Authorities at the <LOCATION> Wheeling-Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Northern Panhandle had planned to dedicate $ 170,000 in snow removal equipment Friday, but that had to be postponed, said Airport Manager <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tominack </PERSON>. `` Actually, the equipment is currently being utilized to clean the runways and we ca n't really take the time to have the dedications,'' <PERSON> Tominack </PERSON> said. `` Priorities are such that we need to get our runways clean.'' Plunging temperatures and surface freezing on roads prompted <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION>'s government to shut down at mid-morning Friday, sending thousands of state employees home. Greater Cincinnati International Airport closed for an hour to permit removal of snow from the runway. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> canceled 12 flights there. Gusty north wind and the cold broke power lines in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, blacking out more than 3,000 customers for a time in parts of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION>, utility officials said. That wind also created wind chill effect readings across <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> from 25 below zero to 45 below. Record lows included 26 below zero at <LOCATION> Dickinson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>; 19 below at <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; 16 below at <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Concordia </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. The low of 15 below at <LOCATION> Salina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, bettered a record that had been on the books since 1901. Farther north, chronically cold <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, on the Canadian border, had a low of 18 below zero. Up to 6 inches of snow in the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> area brought much of the morning rush hour traffic to a halt. Across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, Interstate 71-75 at <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was closed in both directions while crews attempted to clear the most dangerous, hilly stretch of highway. Many people whose cars stalled or ran out of gas during the up to two-hour delay abandoned their cars at the roadside. Slippery pavement in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> suburb, led to a 20-car pileup Friday on Interstate 94. One minor injury was reported. Ski resort operators generally welcome snow, but heavy snow in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> prevented the Antelope Butte ski resort from opening this weekend as planned, according to the resort's owners. As of Thursday morning, 30 inches of snow had been dumped on the resort in north-central <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, and that closed roads to the resort, <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said Thursday. But the equally heavy snow on flatter terrain in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Door </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a peninsula jutting into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, was welcomed `` There is enough snow in the county to provide every man, woman and child with at least 100 snowballs,'' said <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Door </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Study Finds Deepening Hardship Among Latino Families, Children</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Nearly one-fifth of Hispanic families are living in poverty as the decade ends, according to a study released Friday that contends the economic expansion of the 1980s has least benefited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Latinos. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raza </ORGANIZATION> found widespread poverty among Hispanic families led by women, deepening hardships for married-couple families and significant numbers of poor Latino children. `` Hispanics made many gains in the 1980s, politically and socially, especially in visibility and growth,'' said <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raza </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yzaguirre </PERSON>. `` But unfortunately, the economic picture for Hispanics worsened at the same time.'' <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Raza </PERSON>, a non-profit Hispanic research and advocacy organization, said Hispanics were concentrated in low-wage jobs, overrepresented in industries with declining employment and more likely to lose their jobs through plant closings. Hispanics also are the most undereducated group in the country, with only 51 percent of Latinos 25 and older completing four years of high school or more, compared with 78 percent of non-Hispanics. The increasing number of Hispanic families led by women is also a factor, as those families tend to be poor, the study said. In 1980, 21.8 percent of Hispanic families were led by women, but by 1988, women-led families accounted for 23.4 percent of Hispanic families. While 19 percent of Hispanic married-couple families with children were poor in 1988, 59 percent of women-led families were poor, the study said. Among whites, 6.4 percent of married-couple families were poor, while 38.2 percent of women-led families were living in poverty last year, said the study, which was based on <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> data. Among blacks, 12.5 percent of married-couple families were poor, while 56.3 percent of women-led families were in poverty. The study said 12.9 percent of white families were led by women in 1988, while 43.5 percent of black families were headed by women. The study found Hispanic married-couple families had median incomes of $ 25,769 in 1988, significantly lower than the incomes earned by black married-couple families, $ 30,424, and of whites, $ 36,883. The 1980s were also a period of significant poverty among children, the study said, and Hispanic children were among the hardest hit. The study found 44.2 percent of black children living in poverty last year, compared with 37.9 percent for Hispanic children and 14.6 percent for whites. The study said the concentration of Hispanics in low-wage, unstable jobs was one of the most significant factors contributing to Latinos' economic disadvantages in the 1980s. About one-third of all employed Hispanics work in agriculture, mining, manufacturing and private households, while one-fifth of the entire workforce is employed in those areas. The study said evidence also indicates Hispanics have experienced significant levels of employment discrimination throughout the decade. The Hispanic population has grown from 14.5 million to 20.1 million from 1980 to 1989, accounting for 8.2 percent of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population. Hispanics make up 7.6 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workforce.

 If Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> glanced out a bay window of the 40-room Governor's Mansion on Friday, he could a homeless shelter opening across the street. What does the governor, who only spends about a third of his time in the Greek Revival mansion, think about the shelter? `` It's in a good location,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said earlier this week. He said he plans to volunteer soon at the shelter, a two-room building. `` If we're neighbors ... I think it would be a great thing to do,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. The shelter came to the neighborhood after downtown businesses were reluctant to rent space for it, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lofgren </PERSON> in Mayor <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Langfelder </PERSON>'s office, which is enthusiastic about the facility being run by Helping Hands of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, a volunteer group. The <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> offered use of its vacant building, which had been used for storage, and the state provided $ 46,000, <PERSON> Lofgren </PERSON> said. On Friday afternoon, volunteers were painting the walls and sweeping floors. Homeless people were expected later in the day at the shelter, which will offer soup, donuts and coffee. `` They've been constantly asking me, ever since they heard about it, when it's going to open up,'' said volunteer <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> McShane </PERSON>. On Friday, the wait might have seemed particularly long. The noon temperature was 4 degrees below zero _ 37 below with wind chill factor, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. On any night, an estimated 30 to 50 homeless people are on the streets of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lofgren </PERSON> said. The shelter, which has a $ 50,000 annual budget, will be open 24 hours a day. It is intended to serve as an emergency shelter and does n't have beds.

 The last link of a $ 675 million freeway has opened, more than 30 years after its proposal set off years of bickering and court fights. The final link of the <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuther </PERSON> Freeway opened to a flood of cars Thursday evening. <PERSON> Reuther </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickmeyer </PERSON>, and the man who originally proposed Interstate 696, former highway director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON>, attended the ceremony. <PERSON> Reuther </PERSON>, a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union, died in a 1970 plane crash. The final 9.1-mile section was finished this month and was the last link of the 28.2-mile, $ 675 million freeway. The road is expected to carry more than 100,000 vehicles daily at first with that number growing to 170,000 daily, cutting east-west travel time north of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> by as much as 30 minutes, state officials said. Interstate 696, which borders 16 cities, was first proposed in 1957. But the section between Interstate 75 and <LOCATION> Lahser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> had to go through seven communities, and it was up to them to decide which routes to choose among five or six alternatives. They could n't agree, according to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Garceau </PERSON>, deputy district engineer for the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> In 1966, then-Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Romney </PERSON> held a marathon meeting with the seven communities, but they still could n't agree. Binding arbitration upheld court challenges from the disgruntled communities and eventually settled the route in 1968. But then the federal Environmental Protection Act of 1969, which required environmental impact statements, further delayed bid-letting on the last part of the freeway just completed. Land acquisition alone cost $ 81 million.

<TEXT>
 An AIDS test will be routinely performed as part of all autopsies in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and the information will be used to warn contacts of the deceased who may be at risk, health officials said Friday. They emphasized that the identity of any body that tests positive for HIV, the AIDS virus, would be kept confidential, as required by the state's AIDS Confidentiality Law. Thus the medical examiner's office will not report names of AIDS-positive corpses to the city <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. But it will pass on such information as sex, race, age and neighborhood to help studies of how and where the incurable disease is spreading, said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, the chief medical examiner. The only people to know names will be counselors who follow up to warn sex or drug-abusing partners of the AIDS-positive dead that they may have been exposed. The counselors will be trained and made available to <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, but will be under <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>'s command, said Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, city health commissioner. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>'s office estimated that at least 1,000 of the approximately 8,000 post mortems performed annually will turn up HIV infection. About 75,000 people die each year in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but the medical examiner takes jurisdiction only in cases when deaths are violent, suspicious, unexplained or occur without a doctor in attendance. The AIDS testing will be put into effect at the medical examiner's offices soon, after meetings with various AIDS advocacy groups, said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Borakove </PERSON>, speaking for <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>. The groups, representing racial, ethnic and social populations hardest hit by AIDS, have generally resisted, on privacy grounds, any forms of involuntary testing or disclosure. `` We're going to reserve comment until we find out just how it is going to work,'' said <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, spokesman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> developed the plan with <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> and said he could see no sane reason to oppose it. `` What argument can anyone make to not warn the unsuspecting partner of someone who is dead?'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. He and <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> both have said that because of recent gains in treating the disease, infected people reached early enough may expect longer and better lives.

 President <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s government threatened Friday to stop paying soldiers loyal to Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who refuses to recognize the new administration and give up control of the Christian heartland. Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, appeled on televised to Christians in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the Christian-dominated coastal zone to the north to renounce <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and help reunify <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He said a new round of the 14-year civil war could begin at any time. `` My brother in the eastern area: I can guarantee that I am not going to declare war on you, but I can not guarantee that the war is not going to explode again,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, 64, was elected president by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 24 with a mandate to carry out a peace plan negotiated in October. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> like <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, has rejected the election and the accord, demanding a specific timetable for withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A government statement said future army payrolls would be handled by Gen. <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahoud </PERSON>, who was appointed army commander last month after <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> would not pay army salaries unless the five brigade commanders in the Christian enclave submitted monthly payrolls to <PERSON> Lahoud </PERSON> within five days. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> controls the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Officials loyal to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> urged all institutions and employees to `` reject directives and instructions, which are null and void, from those who deal with the occupiers,'' meaning the Syrians. The reference was to <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s government, which is <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and most other governments support. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> became head of a Christian government after President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term ended in September 1988 with <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> unable to agree on a successor. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> led a competing Moslem Cabinet until the peace plan was worked out. In defiance of <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> remains in his bunker beneath the shell-battered presidential palace at <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, a Christian suburb east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and commands about 20,000 Christian troopers. In his televised appeal, <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> told Christians he could not guarantee peace `` as long as the secessionist movement led by General <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> exists. We have learned from past experience that wars simply explode without anyone declaring them.'' He called <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 54, a `` mutineer who is leading the nation toward final partition merely because he is hungry for power.'' Most of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is controlled by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, whose soldiers are in the country under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and the Syrians fought a six-month artillery war that was ended in September by an Arab League cease-fire. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lahoud </PERSON>, who commands 22,000 Moslem soldiers, have established temporary headquarters at <LOCATION> Ablah </LOCATION> in the Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Private Researcher Criticizes Pesticide Report</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A widely circulated report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on pesticides used by farmers included information that was deficient, out-of-date and in some respects one-sided, a private researcher said Friday. However, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gianessi </PERSON> of the Washington-based non-profit Resources for the Future said that despite what he perceived as shortcomings, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> report issued Sept. 7 `` makes an important contribution to the debate'' over the use of chemical pesticides. `` Perhaps my expectation was that it would provide answers to most of these questions as well. It does n't,'' he said. `` It probably should be viewed as an important first try to get on top of this issue and not as the final word.'' The 450-page <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> report cited case studies of farmers using alternative methods of production without the indiscriminate use of chemicals. Among its many proposals was one for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to revise federal farm policies so that environmentally sound production methods would be encouraged. Environmentalists and many others applauded the report, based on a three-year $ 625,000 study by a 17-member committee. The <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> put up $ 410,000 for the study, and other financing included $ 80,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gianessi </PERSON> presented his paper at a briefing on the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> report held by Resources for the Future, an independent group founded in 1952. Its specialty is research in development, conservation and use of natural resources. In his critique, <PERSON> Gianessi </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> _ a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> _ used case studies that were `` data deficient'' in making its case for alternative ways of producing farm crops and livestock. `` Information is often not presented for such key factors as: How often do these alternative farmers simply abandon fields because they are too weedy? How much pesticide use is there on these farms? The report hints at these questions but does n't provide any real quantified answers,'' he said Also, <PERSON> Gianessi </PERSON> said, the case studies were for the 1986 crop year _ and the report came out in 1989. `` The farms are referred to as if they are currently sustaining their successes for 1986,'' he said. `` One of these farms has gone out of business. At least two others have had to abandon key parts of their successful program because of the emergence of a new pest in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the withdrawal of a key pesticide in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.''

 Communist leaders and opposition activists met Friday for the first time and agreed to hold more talks while thousands of people again rallied demanding political reforms. <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Trenchev </PERSON> of the independent trade union <PERSON> Podkrepa </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the Communist leadership, and Premier <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Atanassov </PERSON> met with a Podkrepa leader and three members of the Club for Glasnost and <LOCATION> Perestroka </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trenchev </PERSON> did not attend the meeting. He said it was agreed that a round of talks would begin next week, with the agenda still to be decided. Parliament took these actions Friday: It agreed to have a parliamentary commission headed by <PERSON> Lukanov </PERSON> investigate corruption under former party leader <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>. The commission includes representatives of independent groups who are not members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. A commission was estalished to examine possible environmental damage because of two power projects. Eliminated clauses in the penal code dealing with crimes against the state and granted amnesty to all those punished under those sections. It could not be immediately determined how many people were affected by the amnesty. Several thousand people, many holding candles, gathered near the <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevski </PERSON> cathedral, chanting `` Freedom!'' and `` Resign, Resign!'' as they did during Thursday's mass demonstration in front of Parliament when they called on <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> and house speaker <PERSON> Stanko </PERSON> <PERSON> Todorov </PERSON> to quit. Many of the people first went to a rally outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> but marched to the cathedral when the reform <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> appealed to them to go to the church to honor Soviet human rights champion <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> who died Thursday. About 2,000 people later left the cathedral and walked a half-mile to the state television headquarters where they booed and demanded an apology for television coverage of Thursday's demonstration They said the report had represented them as extremists. <PERSON> Filip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bokov </PERSON>, recently appointed to head the television and radio system, was drowned out by jeers as he tried to address the crowd. He insisted the television commentator had not used the word `` extremists'' but also apologized and TV later showed portions of Thursday's demonstration. Thursday's angry protests be tens of thousands of people developed after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> postponed action on demands that Article 1 of the Constitution, which guarantees the Communist Party the dominant role, be scrapped. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> unanimously approved a statement saying the clause would be removed at its next session in January. The statement said <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> considered dropping the article `` an important step on the way to solidifying political pluralism and the development of a democratic state of law.'' Proposals to set up free elections, which are scheduled to be held by May, and to redistribute state-owned land also be will te considered at the January session. The independent representatives at Friday's meeting were <PERSON> Zheliu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhelev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Petko </PERSON> <PERSON> Simeonov </PERSON> of the Club for Glasnost and Perestroika and <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Spassov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Podkrepa </LOCATION>.

 A French mercenary and 21 of his men arrived in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Friday after French troops landed in the <LOCATION> Comoros </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and peacefully ended the mercenaries' rule Foreign Minister R.F. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told reporters most of the mercenaries, who were in uniform, would be put on flights to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> within 48 hours and the future of their leader, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, was being discussed by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` The idea is to get them out of here as soon as possible,'' said Dries <PERSON> Venter </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. He said the mercenaries had been carrying sidearms, which were confiscated. Earlier Friday, French troops landed at the airport in <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> islands, and took control of security. The French <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> Comoros </LOCATION> government had requested the `` military assistance mission.'' `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has not intervened in the Comoros,'' Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> said in <LOCATION> Lome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>. `` We have lent a hand to a process of returning to a more normal situation toward democracy.'' <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> and the other European mercenaries boarded a South African military plane four hours after the French landing and left for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. They trained and led the 600-man Presidential Guard, and had controlled the Comoros since President <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> was assassinated Nov. 26. Most Comorans believe <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> and his mercenaries, who first put <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> in power in 1978, were responsible for his death. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> has said a bodyguard accidentally shot <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had been the two largest aid donors to the Comoros, a former French colony. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has extensive economic interests in the nation, had financed the presidential guard. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had cut off assistance, however, and were pressuring <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> and his men to leave. Negotiations had been going on for the past several days. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> told a news conferece in <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION> on Thursday that he was willing to relinquish control of the Comoros if the safety of his men was guaranteed and if they were given an unspecified payment. It was unclear Friday if those demands were met. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevenement </PERSON> said earlier this week that the French military would not intervene in the Comoros. A <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> military spokesman said Friday that his nation's troops were dispatched under the French-Comoran defense cooperation agreement and came from the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Mayotte </LOCATION>, 185 miles away. The news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France-Presse </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION> that 50 French paratroopers in helicopters landed Friday morning and were followed by two transport planes full of troops. AFP said that as the first aircraft landed at <LOCATION> Hahaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, about 250 Presidential Guardsmen stood at attention at one end of the runway. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> also was present, dressed in civilian clothes. Five other mercenaries arrived in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Friday after an overnight flight from <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION>. One of them, identified only as Lt. <PERSON> Didier </PERSON>, told reporters that <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> `` did n't want to be king'' of the Comoros. `` He became it in spite of himself,'' <PERSON> Didier </PERSON> said.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration dismissed on Friday as a `` charade'' the promotion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as head of government. As the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not recognized the Noriega-led government since February 1988, the action by the People's Assembly changes nothing, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said.

 For the first time in its 143-year history, the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> is trying to attract corporate support for its vast educational and research activities as a permanent supplement to federal financing. The Smithsonian recently announced the creation of a Corporation Associate Program, starting next year and intended to raise more than $ 1 million annually through corporate contributions or membership dues. The founding chairman of the new fund-raising venture will be <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goizueta </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> pledged the maximum $ 25,000 in membership dues under the new corporate program, which allows companies to co-sponsor a major special event at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> Corporations choosing to pay annual dues of $ 10,000 will be entitled to VIP treatment at Smithsonian events. In the past, corporate support of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> has been confined mostly to underwriting specific museum exhibits or projects. The new program is intended to generate unrestricted funds for the whole range of Smithsonian activities, including its 14 museums and art galleries, the National Zoo and various other educational and research facilities. <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> officials said the institution's current congressional appropriation of $ 266.7 million is insufficiet to finance several ambitious new initiatives. These include attracting more Hispanics, blacks and other minorities, developing exhibits focusing on cultural diversity, environmental and conservation projects; and celebrating the 500th anniversary of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>' discovery of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Federal funds, including $ 30 million in government grants and contracts, account for 83 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s current budget of $ 358.4 million. Net income from non-government <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> trust funds, which include endowments and donations from individuals, foundations and corporations, is expected to total $ 61.7 million. The estimate of corporate donations in the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, was unavailable, but the combined total of unrestricted corporate and foundation gifts last year _ not earmarked for any specific use _ was only $ 1.6 million.

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said Friday he will exert his authority over the millitary and Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who intends to retain command of the army when he leaves the presidency March 11. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said he would meet with the military service commanders, who have ruled <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> since a coup in September 1973, to establish a working relationship. Scattered disturbances broke out Friday in downtown <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. Groups of young leftists threw rocks at police, who responded with water cannon and tear gas. Skirmishes scattered shoppers and halted traffic several times on the principal boulevard, <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. The protesters demanded immediate release of leftists imprisoned on charges of political violence, including many accused of guerrilla activity. Police reported at least 20 arrests. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> soundly defeated two opponents in Thursday's election. At a news conference, he pledged to `` exercise the full powers of the president, and the armed forces must be subordinate and obedient to the president.'' Later Friday, <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> told hundreds of thousands of supporters at a <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> rally that the armed forces' political role `` must end in March'' when he takes over. `` We want to see the armed dedicated to their professional duties, disciplined, obedient, thus recovering the respect of all their compatriots.'' His comment went to the heart of one of the new civilian government's most difficult and sensitive problems: the considerable power that still will be held by the armed service commanders, particularly <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> as head of the 60,000-man army. A special provision of the constitution <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s government wrote in 1980 says the commanders can not be dismissed until 1998. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, 71, won 55.2 of the 7 million votes cast Thursday, as the candidate of a 17-party alliance of the center and left. <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, the pro-government candidate, got 29.4 percent and <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON>, a wealthy enterprenneur, 15.4 percent. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, deputy secretary of state, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` We are enthused ... that -LRB- the elections -RRB- were free and fair. We are very, very pleased that <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has returned to democracy.'' In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> hailed <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>'s victory as `` the return of a great and friendly country ... to the path of freedom.'' At his news conference, <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said: `` <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> is effectively moving back to democracy. There will be no puppet democracy, and there will be no extra-democratic control over my government.'' He said he would talk with military leaders `` as soon as circumstances permit.'' Under the new government, the military will have a majority on a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> empowered to `` represent'' its views to the government. In addition, a bill now being discussed by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s junta would give the armed forces substantial autonomy under the civilian leadership. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> expressed confidence that `` a reasonable formula'' could be found, but declared: `` Nothing will prevent me from fully exercising the presidential powers.'' One of the most delicate issues in future military-civilian relations is expected to be how <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> handles the investigation of human rights abuses under the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> regime. `` We do n't have a wish of revenge, but of truth and justice,'' he said Friday. He also said anyone who committed abuses may be brought to justice, including <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. The 74-year-old general says he will not accept human rights trials of military men, and has issued a clear warning: `` If one of my men is touched, the state of law will be broken.'' After overthrowing President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, an elected Marxist who died during the coup, the military embarked on severe repression of leftists who had supported him. Thousands were arrested, many tortured or killed and others forced into exile. In his campaign, <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> emphasized plans to lead a government of national unity that would attempt to overcome bitter social and political divisions created by the coup and military rule. He indicated Friday that he would seek support from conservative groups to repeal or make democratic changes in laws enacted by the junta. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> was careful to declare, however, that he would govern with the 17 parties of the alliance he led to victory. His alliance will have a 72-48 majority in the 120-seat House of Deputies. It won 22 of the 38 elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats, but <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s constitution gives his government the right to appoint up to 10 more senators Complex election laws written by the junta caused many leftist candidates to lose their races despite getting more votes than rightist opponents. Aides to <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said the laws were designed to ensure a healthy minority presence in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Opponents said the purpose was to prevent changes in the constitution, which require a two-thirds vote in both houses.

<HEAD>FDA Downgrading Rating of Products by Four Generic Companies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is downgrading the therapeutic rating of products made by four generic drug companies because they submitted false or incorrect information in their applications for <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval, the agency said Friday. Many of the products already have been recalled by the companies, or their distribution has been suspended. The lower rating tells physicians and pharmacists that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> does not consider the drugs to be interchangable with the brand-name drug. One of the companies, Quantum Pharmics of <LOCATION> Amityville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, has agreed to give up <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approvals for nearly all its drugs, said <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerling </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Quantum's parent company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>. Quantum had stopped production on the 25 products in September. The company has one drug left on the market, but <PERSON> Emerling </PERSON> said no decision had been made on whether the other products will be reintroduced. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it had downgraded the ratings of 29 products made by <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and that the company has agreed to voluntarily relinquish approvals for the products. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has said it was initiating procedures to withdraw the approvals. However, <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said the company had not agreed to give up the approvals. He said distribution of the products was suspended in April and the company has resubmitted data to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> in supplements to the drug approvals. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> also lowered the rating for a generic form of Dyazide, a popular high blood pressure drug made by <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Copiague </LOCATION>, N.Y. The agency has said it wants to withdraw <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>'s approval for that drug, which would leave no generic version of Dyazide on the market The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> also said it has downgraded the ratings of three tablet strengths of diazepam made by <ORGANIZATION> Superpharm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bayshore </LOCATION>, N.Y. The company voluntarily recalled the products Dec. 7. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is lowering the rating for orphengesic tablets, orphengesic forte tablets and triamterene-hydrocholorothiazide tablets made by Par Pharmaceuticals of <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, N.Y. The agency is moving to withdraw <ORGANIZATION> Superpharm </ORGANIZATION>'s and Par's approvals for those drugs

 A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 passenger jet made a safe emergency landing here Friday after it flew through volcanic ash and temporarily lost power to all four engines, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. There were no reports of injuries. The engine problems were reported immediately after <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 867 passed through ash from Redoubt Volcano, which erupted Thursday and Friday. The volcano is 115 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. The jet carrying 231 passengers and a crew of 14 landed at <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at 12:25 p.m. and taxied to a gate under its own power, airport and <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The plane was traveling to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> when the crew reported smoke in the cockpit and loss of engine power at 11:50 a.m., <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtalik </PERSON> said. About eight minutes later, the crew reported two of the engines had been restarted, <PERSON> Wojtalik </PERSON> said. She said the other two were restarted shortly afterward. The jet fell 13,000 feet during the engine trouble, <PERSON> Wojtalik </PERSON> said. She said the volcanic ash was so fine that it went undetected by radar, and the pilot was unaware of the ash until it appeared on the plane's windshield. Flight restrictions had been imposed because of the volcanic ash. <PERSON> Wojtalik </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> plane was flying where it was supposed to be when the engine problems occurred.

 <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> invited <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to lunch Saturday on this sun-splashed French island in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, and residents are expecting a windfall of tourist dollars from the publicity. `` This is a historic situation for <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Marigot </LOCATION>, the capital. `` We have never had two presidents together.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> will hold a two-hour meeting and working lunch at an exclusive sun resort on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>, 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French officials have announced no agenda for the talks, but the two leaders are expected to discuss the latest developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including the reopening of borders between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The French president has cautioned against a push for a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, saying it could upset the European balance of power. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s invitation to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in return for a visit the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> leader made in May to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. On arrival at Princess <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maarten </ORGANIZATION>, the Dutch half of the island, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> are to be flown separately by helicopter to <PERSON> L'Habitation </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Longvilliers </PERSON>, a 253-room luxury hotel and marina at <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cove </PERSON> on the northeastern coast of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>. A helicopter and scores of French presidential gendarmes and army troops patrolled the 150-acre resort grounds Friday, checking incoming cars with a metal detector. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security officers also were making rounds. Friday afternoon, French security officers exploded a box found under a marina of the resort complex where <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will confer. Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillot </PERSON> said it was determined later that the box, found by divers during a routine surveillance, had been empty. About 100 people were briefly evacuated from the Privilege Hotel nearby. At the meeting site, workers set up a beachside tent for the leaders and hooked up communication cables. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> wo n't be mixing with residents, <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said, which explains the lack of the usual welcoming banners and bunting in the capital. A few tourist shops, however, were selling Bush-Mitterrand T-shirts. `` Tere's a little painting up, a little taping up, but basically that's for Christmas,'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. Similarly, on Dutch <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maarten </LOCATION>, there was little evidence of the event, although <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, publisher of The <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, said: `` Everybody is talking about it, of course.'' The island <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> are visiting is a curious mix of French, Dutch and <LOCATION> Carribbean </LOCATION> cultures. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>, with its sidewalk cafes, fashionable boutiques and strolling gendarmes in khaki shorts and kneesocks, has been called a speck of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Technically, it is a sub-prefecture of the French overseas department of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, which has a status akin to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maarten </LOCATION> is part of the autonomous five-island <LOCATION> Netherland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION>. Dutch is the official language, but few people speak it. Nearly everybody speaks English instead, although the Papiamento language is also heard. The French side is 21 square miles and the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> side 16 square miles. Population estimates vary widely, but the 1990 <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Handbook </LOCATION> says there are at least 8,000 in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> and 14,000 in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maarten </LOCATION>. The French have some topless and all-nude beaches; the Dutch, casino gambling. With duty-free shopping and 36 sandy white beaches ringing the island, both sides have been experiencing a tourism boom in recent years, with a corresponding rise in crime and concerns about overdevelopment. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said he thought the island was bound to benefit from having hundreds of foreign newspaper reporters and TV crews covering the one-day summit. `` That exposure throughout the world is very important to tourism'' the mayor said. `` And we cater to the tourist. We do n't have any other income but the tourist trade. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said 600,000 tourists a year visit the French side of the island alone, spending $ 90 million, not counting cruise ship passengers. Americans account for most of the tourist trade.

 The high court on Friday threw out convictions imposed in the country's longest treason trial and freed five black activists, including three prominent anti-apartheid leaders jailed since 1985. Scores of jubilant supporters, including Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, welcomed the men as they passed through <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s airport en route from <LOCATION> Robben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> prison to their homes near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> `` It's a sign we are winning the struggle,'' said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. `` We knew that justice would prevail one day.'' The three leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and one of their co-defendants, a church worker, were convicted of treason in November 1988 after a three-year trial. They received sentences ranging from six to 12 years from a judge who contended the front sought to incite anti-government violence. The Appeal Court in <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION> overturned the verdicts against those four and seven co-defendants convicted of terrorism. Six of the seven received suspended sentences, but one, <PERSON> Muzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Malindi </PERSON>, was given a five-year term and sent to the <LOCATION> Robben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> penitentiary. <LOCATION> Malindi </LOCATION> was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Vaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Hundreds of chanting well-wishers greeted the five at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s airport. Police used guard dogs to control the crowd, confiscated banners, and seized film from at least two news photographers. The independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported that a woman in the welcoming crowd was bitten by a police dog and that the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, an anti-apartheid leader, was arrested when he tried to aid her. Police had no immediate comment. A five-judge appellate panel unanimously upheld defense lawyers' arguments that the trial judge, <PERSON> Kees </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON>, improperly dismissed one of the two legal experts assisting him in the trial <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> asserted that law professor W.A. <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON> was too sympathetic to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> because he had signed a front-supported petition opposing a new constitution that entrenched racially segregated politics. During the trial, most of the defendants were granted bail. But <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> repeatedly denied bail for the three leaders of the front, a huge multiracial coalition formed in 1983 to campaign for black political rights. `` We have not sacrificed more than so many others. We do not feel bitter,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lekota </PERSON>, one of the front leaders, after being carried shoulder-high through the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> airport. `` For us, it does not stop here. It's the beginning of another chapter.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> ruled that the front was a `` revolutionary organization'' that conspired with the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement to provoke violence in black townships in 1984 in a bid to render <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> ungovernable. The front was banned in February 1988, but most of its leaders have circumvented or defied the ban. <PERSON> Lekota </PERSON>, 41, the front's publicity secretary, was sentenced to 12 years in prison; <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Molefe </PERSON>, 37, the front's national secretary, and <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, 41, secretary of the <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> branch, were sentenced to 10 years. The Rev. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Manthata </PERSON>, 49, a church field for the South African Council of Churches, was sentenced to six years. `` We always believed in their innocence,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the church council. `` Their conviction and sentencing were examples of the grave miscarriage of justice which the apartheid courts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> hand down.'' Lawyers for Human Rights, an association of civil rights lawyers, hailed the <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling as `` an excellent victory'' that would help restore the credibility of the South African judiciary. The group urged the government to disclose the cost of `` this abortive prosecution which took years of blundering incompetence to achieve nothing but red faces.'' The trial began in 1985 in the farming town of <LOCATION> Delams </LOCATION> and was shifted to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Eleven of the original 22 defendants were acquitted at various stages. One of the activists' lawyers, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, said the Appeal Court ruling appeared to be based solely on legal questions and doubted it was related to the changing political climate created by President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s easing of curbs on opposition activity. The trial entailed 439 days of court proceedings spread over more than three years. The 368-page indictment named more than 900 alleged co-conspirators, ranging from <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> to African National Congress leader <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>. There were more than 220 witnesses and the official court record contained about 30,000 pages.

 Investigators have found no evidence of jury tampering in the murder trial 26 years ago of a fertilizer salesman charged in the slaying of civil rights activist <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>. Charges against <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, a white supremacist who at the time was a salesman in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, were dropped after two all-white <ORGANIZATION> Hinds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> juries were unable to reach verdicts. Allegations of possible jury tampering by a state agency recently were raised. `` So far, there is absolutely no evidence to indicate jury tampering,'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON> said Thursday. `` None were contacted. None were even aware that any contact had been made with their employers until after the fact.'' <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON>, who led the jury-tampering investigation into the second, April 1964 trial, said he told a <LOCATION> Hinds </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury his findings Thursday in a closed-door meeting at the courthouse. Prosecutors now will turn their attention to <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>'s first trial earlier in 1964, although no allegations of jury tampering have been raised about that trial. <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, field director of the state <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, was shot to death June 12, 1963, outside his home in northwest <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>'s rifle, bearing one of his fingerprints, was found near the Evers home. <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> contended the rifle had been stolen from him. <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON> said Thursday that prosecutors are still trying to decide if the murder case itself can be reopened and new charges sought. `` My opinion is unless we can have the benefit of the evidence available in 1964 and newly discovered evidence, it would be extremely hard to get around the speedy trial question,'' <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, 68, now lives in Signal Mountain, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. The district attorney's office investigated <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>'s April 1964 trial after a Jackson newspaper reported Oct. 1 that the state <ORGANIZATION> Sovereignty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the state's segregation spy agency, screened potential jurors. `` What was done was the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Sovereignty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- investigator would call up employers and say, ` What can you tell me about this person?''' <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON> said. `` While I consider it extremely unethical for one state agency to be working against state prosecutors, it still is not a crime,'' <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON> said. The commission, formed by the 1956 <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, died after its funding was cut off in 1973. <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON> said he and others in the district attorney's office contacted 11 of the 12 jurors in the second <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> trial and are seeking the other juror. <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON> said he and investigators talked earlier with former <ORGANIZATION> Sovereignty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Erle </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> and reviewed records <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> kept. The commission's own records are sealed in a vault on orders of the 1977 Legislature. The rifle and all other evidence from the two trials are missing from the <LOCATION> Hinds </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> circuit clerk's office. But <PERSON> DeLaughter </PERSON> said there's no indication the evidence was stolen. If cases are inactive for many years, the law allows the evidence to be destroyed.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> published a draft declaration Friday that it was ready to give up guaranteed power and compete with other parties in elections next year. It also called for a new constitution guaranteeing market-oriented economic reform, respect for human rights and an independent judiciary. `` The Communist Party of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> supports freedom of assembly and speech, and all other civil liberties regardless of political convictions of individuals,'' said the document, written by a committee preparing for a party congress next month. The party will relinquish its monopoly on power and take part in `` free, direct and secret -LRB- ballot -RRB- elections,'' the document said, and `` we are changing all of this now in order that tomorrow it will not be too late for socialism in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.'' Reforms specified in the declaration should be carried out within six months after the congress, it said, as published by the daily <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION>. Some opponents of change fear independent parties would be formed along ethnic lines and further exacerbate tensions in this tenuous federation of six republics and two autonomous republics. Communist leaders in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the largest of republic, has resolutely opposed Western-style democracy, but appeared to soften the stance Friday at a regional congress. <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Trifunovic </PERSON>, Serbian party chief, said in a keynote address that Communists and <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> authorities `` have no reason or wish to administratively impede the establishment'' of other political parties. <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, the second-largest republic, the liberal <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> in the north already have endorsed democratic reform. Both have scheduled free legeslative elections for spring. Numerous independent political movements and parties have been formed in <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> during the past year. Despite official opposition, several independent groups also have been formed in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bosnia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, where Communists have in tried to avoid reform in the past. The Serbian leadership has argued that one-party rule was needed to control centuries-old ethnic conflicts that have boiled up since the death in 1980 of President <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, who founded Communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Much of the recent unrest has centered on the province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where ethnic Albanians form a majority of more than 90 percent. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> is the largest republic, and both of the nation's provinces, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, are part of it but not fully subject to its control <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, was a part of ancient <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. Most of the Christian Serbs in the province view the Moslem Albanians as intruders and accuse Albanians of harassing them. The draft declaration by the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> will seek `` full participation in integration processes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and membership in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and other similar organizations and institutions.''

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> announced Friday that it has 627,500 troops abroad, its first such disclosure of its foreign forces, and said it would like to bring them home by the year 2000. However, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>, who made the announcement, said the pullouts would not be unilateral and would depend on negotiations with other nations. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the statement was `` encouraging.'' He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position is that all such matters are to be worked out at the conventional forces talks under way in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> did not give a breakdown of troop deployment and said it was well known that the troops were stationed in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries and in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>.

A year ago, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced his nation would make massive, unilateral cuts in soldiers and military equipment overseas. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said that next year it is possible to conclude a practical agreement on withdrawal of conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` But in order to achieve the aim of withdrawing troops to national boundaries, it is necessary to use different bilateral and multilateral arrangements and talks,'' he said.

 Nearly one year after the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, investigators said Friday they have assembled some clues to the international terrorist plot but are not close to prosecuting anyone. `` What we are doing in effect is trying to piece together an international terrorist jigsaw,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Esson </PERSON>, a police official. `` We have some of the pieces, some we are trying to place, and some we have yet to find.'' <PERSON> Esson </PERSON> spoke as Scottish officials announced the first public inquiry to be held into the explosion of Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21, 1988, that killed all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground. The inquiry, to be held next year before an independent judge, will be the first in which members of the public will have the chance to attend the proceedings. A criminal police investigation and a <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation alreday are under way in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Speaking at a news conference, officials said one focus of the investigation is the Popular Front For the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, a radical Palestinian faction headed by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>. But they said other groups also were under investigation. `` It would be right to say that we have focused our attention on one group but it would be unwise for us to exclude others,'' <PERSON> Esson </PERSON> said. Asked whether that one group was the <ORGANIZATION> PFLP-GC </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` certainly.'' <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, a former Syrian army officer, has denied involvement though he has said his faction has used devices like the one that brought down Flight 103. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s senior law officer, and <PERSON> Esson </PERSON>, chief constable of the <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> <PERSON> Constabulary </PERSON>, told reporters they also are interested in <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>, a member of another radical Palestinian group who is charged in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> with four bombings in northern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Also Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, attorneys for families of 13 members of the flight crew filed a lawsuit alleging that two companies failed to provide adequate security. The lawsuit says <ORGANIZATION> Alert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which provided security at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airports, failed to comply with minimum security procedures. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Loflin </PERSON> said the airline had n't heard of the lawsuit. <PERSON> Esson </PERSON> said the police investigation has encompassed 52 countries and <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> have been `` the focus of important areas of investigation.'' Investigators have said the bomb was made of a plastic explosive packed in a radio-cassette player in a suitcase loaded into a forward cargo hold of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747. They released photos Friday showing the reconstruction of the forward hold, with a gaping hole, and the reconstructed metal container which held the suitcase bomb. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said significant progress had been made in identifying other contents of the suitcase, including clothing. He said he ordered the Scottish public inquiry now because the police investigation had reached a stage where he thought it would be `` appropriate.'' He did not elaborate, but said the inquiry could be postponed or canceled if criminal proceedings appeared likely. The public inquiry, formally known as a fatal accident inquiry, will be held next year although a date and a presiding judge have not yet been selected, <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said. He confirmed he had requested Swedish permission for Scottish police to remove clothing from <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>'s Swedish home, reportedly to compare it with the recovered shreds. `` I have at present no intention to seek the extradition of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Esson </PERSON> would not say how many individuals were under investigation nor whether all were Arabs. Some are in a position where they could be extradited, he said. Scottish police still believe the bomb `` either started or passed through <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport'' where the flight originated, he said. West German police maintain that has not been proven. Unconfirmed news reports have said the suitcase arrived in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on an Air <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> flight from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island and was transferred onto the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight without an accompanying passenger. <PERSON> Esson </PERSON> said he believed police will obtain enough evidence to prosecute the bombers, but said `` there are more investigations to be conducted.'' The photographs released Friday were of sections of the plane, painstakingly reconstructed from wreckage scattered over 845 square miles to determine precisely how it was destroyed. The reconstruction was done by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> based at <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which will publish a report on its findings in the first half of 1990. One photograph shows the fuselage, including the forward cargo hold area where the suitcase bomb exploded. The section 55 feet long, 27 feet high and 25 feet wide shows a gaping hole. The metal is peeled back, illustrating what investigators called the `` petaled out'' effect produced by the explosion. Another photo shows the reconstructed metal cargo container, with the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> insignia on the side, in which the suitcase had been loaded onto the plane.

 An arson fire Friday at a high-rise apartment complex for the elderly killed three people out of reach of fire ladders, and safety violations at the building hampered rescue efforts, authorities said. Residents of the 15-story Midtown Towers were evacuated in sub-zero temperatures after the early morning blaze broke out on the first floor and pumped smoke into upper floors. Authorities said 77 residents and two firefighters were hospitalized, most for treatment of smoke inhalation. Six residents were listed in critical condition and 19 were in guarded condition Friday afternoon. Twenty-six residents were listed as stable. `` A lot of people were hanging out the upstairs windows screaming,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Guilfoyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambulance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was a tremendous amount of flames coming out the front and back end of the building.'' As the acrid smoke filled the building, notes for help fluttered from windows to rescuers below. `` It was terrible, terrible,'' said wheelchair-bound resident <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. State fire investigators called the fire `` probable arson,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennegan </PERSON> said. If this preliminary determination stands, the deaths will be investigated as homicides, he said. A door at the base of the building's stairwell jammed, trapping some residents until it was pried open.

 District Attorney <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> was indicted by a federal grand jury Friday for allegedly aiding a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> bookie by returning seized gambling records. Eight others were also named in the indictment for running or aiding the $ 2,000 a day sports gambling operation. They included convicted bookmaker <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>, who is now <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON>'s attorney Also indicted were actor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, 63; <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, 70, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> real estate developer; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, 34, no address; <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolino </PERSON>, 57, no address; <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ethridge </PERSON>, 30, no address; and <PERSON> Darleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON> <PERSON> Toca </PERSON>, 27, no address. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bertolino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Ethridge </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Toca </PERSON> were charged with owning and conducting an illegal gambling operation. Fanning, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> were accused of aiding the operation by helping <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> devise the excuse for returning the records to <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON>. The excuse was that <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON> needed the records to pay his federal taxes, specifically, to file his December federal gambling stamp tax returns. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said that since the indictment included Fanning, who worked with him in the federal prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, the case was being handled by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> division from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> native who was in the movie `` Valley of the Dolls,'' and Ms. <PERSON> Ethridge </PERSON> also were charged with perjury for allegedly lying to the grand jury investigating the case. <PERSON> Connick </PERSON>, district attorney in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> since 1974, denied any wrongdoing. At a news conference attended by about 150 of his staff members and supporters, he accused <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> of carrying out a personal vendetta, complete with `` Brown Shirt'' tactics. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office is using the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to do his dirty work for him,'' <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> said he would not resign and would run for re-election to a fourth term next year, even if the case is still pending. He said he did not expect the indictment to affect his handling of his office. `` I'm not going to roll over and play dead for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> or anybody else,'' <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> said, sparking enthusiastic applause from the crowd of supporters. When the grand jury investigation surfaced in January, <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> said the probe centered on the way the bookmaker, <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON>, got copies of the betting sheets seized in a Dec. 4, 1988, raid on his apartment. At the time <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> said he received telephone calls on behalf of <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON> from Fanning, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, and he acknowledged that he got copies of the gambling records for <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON>. `` There is nothing unusual, nothing illegal, about a prosecutor returning to the accused his property or copies of his property,'' <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> told the news conference. He denied having been advised by his staff or police that returning the property would help a gambling operation. `` Despite being advised by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> police and his own staff that defendant <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON> needed the bookmaking records solely to pay and collect the illegal bookmaking debts and to continue the illegal gambling business without disruption, defendant <PERSON> Connick </PERSON>, without examining records and before the case had been referred to or accepted by his office for prosecution, ordered the return of copies of the bookmaking records to defendant <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON>, who he had been informed was one of the largest bookmakers in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>,'' the indictment said. <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> also told Fanning he would attempt to get <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> returned to the bookmaker, despite being advised by police that <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON> used the car in paying and collecting gambling debts, the indictment said All the defendants face a maximum 25 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine if convicted. The perjury counts could net <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Ethridge </PERSON> an extra five years and $ 250,000 fines each. <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> has denied any personal grudge. He refused to elaborate on the indictment at a Friday news conference. <PERSON> Aucoin </PERSON> was released the same day of his 1988 arrest without having to post bond.

 <PERSON> Jock </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, perhaps <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s most famous stuntman-turned-actor famed for his television roles as Tarzan, <PERSON> Yancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Derringer </PERSON> and the Range Rider, has died of an apparent stroke. He was 70. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Poulsbo </LOCATION>, died Thursday at <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where he was taken after an automobile accident two days earlier. An autopsy will be done to verify the cause of death, a routine procedure for deaths from car accidents, said <LOCATION> Kitsap </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s chief deputy coroner, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Jermy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, born <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, was a tall, rugged youth who began his film career in 1945 after serving as a fighter pilot in World War II. He did stunt work for <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Autry </PERSON> and others. <PERSON> Autry </PERSON> signed him to a contract and cast him in `` The Range Rider,'' an action-packed television series in the 1950s. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> socked and tumbled his way through appearances on `` The Loretta Young Show,'' `` Rawhide,'' `` <PERSON> Yancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Derringer </PERSON>,'' `` Laramie'' and other programs until his career began to fade in the 1960s. He appeared in several `` Tarzan'' movies during that decade, one of which led to a major bout with illness. While filming in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> came down with dengue fever, dysentery and pneumonia. `` I refused to take my own advice: Know your limitations and fight the urge to do the stunt just one more time,'' he later said. After more than two years of recovery, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s star began to rise again in the late 1960s when he appeared on numerous television shows, including several `` Tarzan'' episodes. In 1973 he suffered a severe stroke on the set of `` Kung Fu'' and made only occasional appearances thereafter. He was seen in several 1981 episodes of `` B.J. and the Bear.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, under attack for his handling of the nation's economic crisis, on Friday accepted the resignation of his economy minister and shuffled two other Cabinet posts. In another development, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> declared a bank holiday Monday to let shaky financial markets settle. By Tuesday, banks and exchange houses will have been closed for three of the past six working days. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Erman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, an accountant and former provincial treasury secretary, was named to replace Economy Minister <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> served briefly in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> as a vice president and has been in the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> as minister of health since <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s May 14 election. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s former campaign manager, <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mera </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, was appointed interior minister to replace <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauza </PERSON>, who was named minister of health. <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> is a longtime strategist in <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` I have resigned, and if you are looking for scandalous statements, then you have n't gotten to know me very well in five months,'' <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> told reporters. Asked as he walked out of the Treasury Building after noon what he intended to do in the future, <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> replied, `` I'm going to have lunch.'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> canceled a news conference Friday evening. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> told reporters no other Cabinet changes would be made and the new ministers will be sworn in Monday. `` The government will continue along the same general lines,'' declared Foreign Minister <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavallo </PERSON>, a Harvard-educated economist. The Cabinet shakeup followed a 6-week plunge of the austral on foreign exchange markets, soaring interest rates, strikes by teachers, doctors, court clerks and other public employees for higher wages and rekindled inflation. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s tax reform and 1990 budget proposal have stalled in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and organized labor stepped up its criticism that two stabilization plans imposed since he took office in July were aimed at curtailing inflation by forcing workers to accept cuts in real wages. Last week, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> officially devalued the austral and raised public service rates again. He angered businessmen by increasing taxes on exports and suspending for two years the repayment of principal on internal bonds. Labor leaders, politicians and businessmen were cautious in their assessment of the political shakeup. `` It was unavoidable,'' said <PERSON> Guerino </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreoni </PERSON>, co-director of the 3 million-member General Confederation of Labor. <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornide </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Argentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> had concentrated on curtailing inflation to the exclusion of other important goals, such as controlling interest rates and wage levels. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a member of the small <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is the third economy minister in <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s government. The first, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Roig </PERSON>, died of a heart attack six days after he was sworn in. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' appointment was expected to appeal to organized labor and factions of the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that disagree with <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s plans to reduce state expenditures, sell public companies, lower tariff barriers and increase taxes. <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ducler </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> aide who also resigned, called the departing economic team `` a dike against the demands of those who resisted the modernization of the economy.'' <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON>, 60, is a former executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Bunge </ORGANIZATION> and Born grain trading multinational synonomous with `` big business'' in this South American country. It is viewed with distaste by unions and leftist elements within <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s party. His resignation has been expected since the free market austral plunged to 1,560 per dollar on Thursday from 1,020 the week before. Meanwhile, supermarkets and other stores began to mark up prices drastically in anticipation of inflation projected to top 30 percent in December. The November rate was 6.5 percent; the October rate, 5.6 percent. <PERSON> Mera </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> is a former national deputy with long ties to the Peronists. During the 1970s, he was aligned with its leftist factions and imprisoned for three years following a 1976 military coup. After the restoration of democracy in 1983, <PERSON> Mera </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> worked within the party and was an early backer of <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, then a provincial governor.

<TEXT>
 The raucous news conferences of the <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> era will have a touch more class under his more sedate successor, his press secretary said. To begin with, call him `` Mr. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>.'' But first, raise your hand! That was the word Friday from <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON>, the press secretary for Mayor-elect <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, as he laid down some `` rules of conduct'' for the City Hall press corps. <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing, told reporters that <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> `` places a high value on courtesy and mutual respect'' and would like to be addressed as `` Mr. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>'' at press conferences. <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> said reporters also should raise their hands when they want to ask questions and be recognized before doing so, rather than blurt them out in competition with other journalists. `` I would be grateful to you if you would please respectfully pose your questions, ` Mr. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>'. He'll respond to you,'' <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> said at the third in a series of press briefings he has set up during the transition of government from the <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> administration. `` I would appreciate it if you would please try to restrain yourself and not ask out of turn,'' he said. Asked if <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> had complained to him about the way the press asked its questions, <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> said, `` No. He has not.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said later he did not mind how reporters addressed him. He said he did not know <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> was going to make such a request and had not asked him to do so. However, he said, `` I do think it would be useful if reporters were not discourteous to each other.'' At Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s news conferences, reporters tend to call him `` Mr. <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON>,'' `` Mayor'' or `` Your Honor.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> seemed amused by the whole thing when he learned about the request. `` I wonder what it would have been like if they called me Mr. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>, like a horse?'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Average Japanese Income Tops U.S.; Still Behind Switzerland</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Edits throughout to CLARIFY that figures are per capita calculations
of gross national product.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national income, figured on the basis of population, rose slightly in 1988 but was far outpaced by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. Per capita income in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year was $ 19,780, compared with $ 18,580 in 1987. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the income rose from $ 15,840 to $ 21,040, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said. The bank gave all incomes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> arrives at its figures by dividing the value of a country's total production, the gross national product, by its population. Per capita income thus includes people without income, such as children, and non-wage income, such as returns on invstments. The Swiss continued to rank first in per capita income with a 1988 average of $ 27,260, up from $ 21,310 in 1987. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> ranked lowest among the 152 members of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> with a 1988 annual per capita income of $ 100. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which in 1987 ranked second only to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> in per capita income, was fifth last year, behind <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. The figure for <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> was $ 20,160, while in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> it was $ 20,020. Much of the rise in the Japanese income can be attributed to an increase in the value of the yen in comparison with the dollar, as well as to increased Japanese production. Elsewhere, differences could be linked to shifts in the value of the dollar compared with other currencies. The dollar has been rising in 1989 after a fall that began in 1985. One former <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> economist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned that the figures should not be taken to reflect living standards. `` In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, people have to spend 15 percent of their income fighting the climate,'' he said. `` That's not the case in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s per capita income was $ 13,320 for 1988, compared with $ 10,430 the previous year. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s was $ 19,150, up from $ 15,610. The bank gives no figure on per capita income for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which is not a member country. However, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> puts it at $ 8,850, well behind $ 12,480 in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and $ 10,140 in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> rank low on the list with an average income of less than a dollar a day _ $ 330 a year. The per capita in the African countries of <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> was $ 340 a year and $ 360 a year in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> reported the fastest growth rate: 9 percent between 1986 and 1988, while <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s income grew by only 1.5 percent and <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> declined 4.5 percent. That does not take in account such illegal production as drugs and other goods made for the black market, or wages that are unreported to avoid taxes. It has been estimated that this `` underground economy'' can account for as much as a third of some countries' incomes. `` The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> Atlas 1989'' also reported on some quality-of-life elements. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was at the top in life expectancy. A Japanese baby born in 1988 could expect to live to age 78, compared with 77 for a Swiss, French or Swedish baby, 75 for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> baby, 69 for a Soviet and 42 in such poor African countries as <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>. Literacy varied widely. <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> reported in 1985 _ the latest figures available _ that only 12 percent to 14 percent of their people could read and write. <ORGANIZATION> Unesco </ORGANIZATION> reports that the literacy rate is 95 percent or higher in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the more prosperous countries of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> reported a 69 percent literacy rate. Many poor countries have reported big jumps in school enrollment between 1970 and 1986: from 56 percent to 80 percent in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and from 7 percent to 50 percent in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>.

 A commander of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction insisted Friday that his forces had raided a Syrian army base in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, though <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters condemned the attack. Thursday's attack, which Lebanese police also blamed on <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> group, threatened to undermine efforts to end a six-year rift between <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> Police reported 15 people were killed and 43 wounded when Palestinian guerrillas from <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest faction in the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, attacked <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intelligence headquarters in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> at the village of <LOCATION> Rmaile </LOCATION>. `` The operation was carried out by Palestinians. No Lebanese took part in the attack,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> commander, who identified himself only by his nom-de-guerre of Abu-Maher. He said <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> commanders in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> prepared the attack without consulting <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` No one knew about it at <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>,'' he said in an interview in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Hilweh refugee camp 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It is the main <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A statement issued Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, denounced the attack without explicitly denying that <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> members were involved. The statement said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had ordered an investigation in collaboration with the other factions in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> to identify the `` authors and commanders'' of the attack. As chief of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> umbrella group, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> presides over several factions of guerrilla fighters who sometimes launch independent attacks or war among themselves. Syrian officials in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> made no comment on Thursday's fighting, which undermined efforts by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> to achieve long-elusive <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unity before convening an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference About 150 of <PERSON> Abu-Maher </PERSON>'s fighters reportedly stormed and ransacked the Syrian base three miles north of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> to free comrades held there. Police said the dead included four Syrians and five Palestinians. They said a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla, two leftists and three members of the Nasserite militia that has ruled <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war broke out in April 1975 were also killed at a checkpoint north of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> when they clashed with the returning <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> fighters.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s drug treatment czar, under fire for alleged shoddy management of his agency and helping friends obtain lucrative state contracts, resigned Friday. The embattled bureaucrat, former heroin addict <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, was quickly given a new state job by <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> at a `` comparable'' salary. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 45, one of the <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> administration's highest ranking Hispanics, received $ 87,338 as director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Substance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. He will become head of the state prison system's drug treatment programs, said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON>. Only a few hours earlier, but before <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> had a lengthy meeting with several top <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> aides, a spokesman said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> had no plans to quit. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> came under fire Thursday when the state <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION>, after a year-long probe, outlined a string of alleged abuses and called for an overhaul of the Martinez-led state substance abuse division. In his resignation, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said the commission's report failed to present `` a complete and balanced view'' of his division's work, but the charges `` have effectively precluded my ability to provide strong and continuing leadership within the agency.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, in a letter to <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, said the job he had held was `` undoubtedly one of the most difficult positions in public service anywhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The Martinez-headed agency also had come under fire from the state comptroller's office and <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s own management advisers. The division announced a restructuring after that earlier criticism. <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> got a new job `` because the governor has a very high regard for <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> and always has. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>'s ability to motivate and inspire people to seek and participate fully in treatment is a great asset to the state.'' <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> also noted that in his new job, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> `` would not have the administrative burden'' he had in the old job. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and a drug treatment activist in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was picked to head the state's drug treatment efforts by then-Gov. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> in 1979. Hispanic leaders recently had pressed <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to keep <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> in that post despite the critical reports about his agency. Traditionally, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> does n't fire cabinet members he's unhappy with, they simply resign, as <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> did. The governor, who is facing an expected re-election race next year, has recently been trumpeting a major new state effort to battle drug abuse. On Thursday, the Cuomo-appointed anti-corruption commission said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s agency suffered from an intricate web of favoritism and infighting. The commission said friends of <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> won million-dollar, drug-treatment contracts that never led to any treatment. Three of four residential drug treatment programs investigated over the last year failed to open a single bed, despite millions of dollars in state funding, said the commission, headed by <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Dean <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Feerick </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Ferrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, over the objection of other top division officials, frequently had intervened on behalf of friends and long-time associates to arrange funding for their proposed drug-treatment programs. `` The evidence concerning all four programs under investigation indicates that a personal connection to Director <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> or other executive staff members smoothed the way for <ORGANIZATION> DSAS </ORGANIZATION> funding,'' the commission said. The commission report did n't call for <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> to be replaced. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said Friday that the commission has not yet decided whether to recommend a criminal investigation.

<HEAD>Reports Soviet Military Cutbacks on Schedule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet military budget for next year is 8.2 percent lower than for 1989 and unilateral cutbacks have reduced Soviet armed forces by 256,000 personnel, a senior army officer said Friday. Col. Gen. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> told a news conference that under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program `` the image of the armed forces is changing.'' He said military staffs were going ahead with the plan to cut troop strength by 500,000 by 1991. Plans for the cutbacks and reduced military spending were announced by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 7, 1988. `` As of today, we have carried out 50 percent of our goal, we have reduced our troops by 256,000 people,'' said <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON>, director of the General Staff. He said there has been an additional reduction of 173,000 military cadets. `` We have substantially reduced major military maneuvers and we are reducing the plans for military materiel and weapons,'' he said. As of Jan. 1, 1990, Soviet troop strength will consist of 3,993,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen, compared to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 2.2 million military personnel, according to <LOCATION> Chervov </LOCATION>. He did not specify where the cuts were made, but said the reductions were not limited to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and applied to all branches of the armed forces. <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> said the 1990 military budget is 70.9 billion rubles -LRB- $ 114.8 billion -RRB-, compared to 77.3 billion rubles for this year. Some of the money slashed from the military budget will be used to convert military production plants into civilian operations to produce more consumer goods, he said, but he gave no figures. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms include increasing consumer goods to alleviate the country's chronic shortages.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, the son of Colombian peasants, was a pig farmer who became one of the richest men in the world with profits from cocaine trafficking. He was believed to have more than a billion dollars stashed away at the time of his death Friday in a gunfight with police. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, 42, was one of the leaders of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, which along with the <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> cartel is responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> had a grade school education and went from pig farming to bartending. In the 1970s he became a hired killer for a Colombian gangster trying to gain control of emerald mines. He became feared throughout the tropical areas of central <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, killing emerald buyers and stealing their wares. He also became wealthy and surrounded himself with bodyguards and beautiful women. About 10 years ago he became aware of the immense appetite for drugs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and began using his emerald-war profits to buy cocaine base from <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> to be processed into pure cocaine. By 1984 he had so much money he was giving some away. When the southern city of <LOCATION> Popayan </LOCATION> was devastated by a 1984 earthquake, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> was seen walking through the ruined city giving money to stunned survivors. He and other major drug traffickers banded together to form the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, named after the northwestern city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> where smugglers traditionally had their headquarters. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> had many ranches, but perhaps his favorite was at <LOCATION> Pacho </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. After the government declared war against the drug dealers last August when a presidential candidate was assassinated the army occupied the Pacho ranch. Many peasants in the area told an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter at the time of the takeover that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> was generous. They said he gave away thousands of dollars, providing money for medical treatment and for seed and farm equipment when they could not get loans from the government's farm bank. Police acknowledged that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>'s popularity with peasants had made it difficult to trap him. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diplomat, speaking with the condition of anonymity, told journalists three months ago that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> and other traffickers had hundreds of people on their payrolls to help watch for police raids. A vendor in a town square would be paid $ 50 a month to watch for security forces heading toward <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>'s ranch, the diplomat said, and a police colonel might be paid $ 15,000 a month for information. But if <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> was a saint to some Colombians he was a monster to others. Authorities said he was behind the Aug. 18 murder of Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, one of the country's leading presidential candidates who was shot down while addressing a campaign rally. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> had called for more energetic action against drug traffickers. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> also was responsibile for the killing in 1988 of <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON>, leader of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. More than 700 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> have been slain the past four years. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> was accused of paying right-wing death squads to kill peasants suspected of supporting leftist guerrillas. Officials said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> was enraged by the guerrillas' attempts to extort money from ranchers in areas where he owned property and vowed to exterminate them and any of their sympathizers

<TEXT>
 A thief who ransacked a house, raided the refrigerator, unwrapped about 40 Christmas presents and made off with some of the gifts apparently had a change of heart. The thief returned the packages the next day with about $ 5 in change and this note: `` Please forgive me. Here are your belongings and some money to fix the window. It may not be enough, but I'll keep bringing some til I pay you back fully. I'm very sorry. Please accept my apology and please do n't send me away.'' <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shigley </PERSON>, 31, said the presents were found Thursday on her porch by her 10-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, with about $ 5 in nickels and dimes. Mrs. <PERSON> Shigley </PERSON> said the money probably came from a change jar that the thief spilled in the house the day before. The presents were in their original boxes. `` I was amazed. My heart was broke when they all got stolen,'' she said. `` When they came back, I thought, ` Jesus, people really do have a conscience.''' Mrs. <PERSON> Shigley </PERSON> said she may return the favor. `` I thought of leaving a note out there to wish him a merry Christmas and thank him for having a conscience, and I've even thought of leaving a small gift out there for him.'' Her other daughter, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON>, 12, arrived home from school Wednesday to find the back door window broken. `` Apparently, they came in and made themselves at home. There was cereal and chocolate cookies and cherry pie filling laying out,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Shigley </PERSON> said. She later said she believes only one thief was involved. The presents under the family Christmas tree were unwrapped, and about seven were missing. `` The rest were open for everybody to see,'' she said. `` All my kids know all their surprises.'' <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION>, a city of about 23,000 people in the northwestern corner of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, is about 100 miles east of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>.

 `` Gone With the Wind'' turned 50 years old Friday, but it will never age in the eyes of the fans who gathered for a gala `` re-premiere'' of the blockbuster Civil War movie. `` It's part of our blood,'' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who traveled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> with his mother and sister to attend the week-long celebration marking the anniversary of the movie's Dec. 15, 1939, premiere. <PERSON> Butterfly </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>, the child-voiced actress who played the slave Prissy in the movie, did n't attend the premiere in 1939, when the <ORGANIZATION> Loews </ORGANIZATION> was a whites-only theater. But she stole the show Friday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatre </ORGANIZATION>, entertaining the crowd with lines from her role and a song to the tune of the `` Tara'' theme. Hers was the biggest applause when the surviving cast members were introduced by talk show host <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, but the real star of the show was the movie itself. The crowd applauded everything _ from the title as it swept across the screen to the stars' names as the credits were rolled. Many of the fans came to the reception and screening dressed in antebellum costumes. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Burleston </PERSON> of Amboy, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, wore her wedding dress, altered with a hoop and green trim to resemble an 1860s ball gown. Her friend, <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, rented her hoop skirt from a costume shop. `` They said it -LRB- antebellum attire -RRB- was optional, but we thought, ` Why not?''' said Ms. <PERSON> Viola </PERSON>, whose trip to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was a Christmas gift from her aunt. Fans from as far away as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> came for the event, but the crowd was far smaller than the million or so who waited in the cold to see <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Cable </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> on that Friday night in 1939. Then, the crowd was so thick that one man perched on a street sign for hours in hopes of catching a glimpse of the stars as they passed in a 30-car motorcade on <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> to the Loews Grand Theatre. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the home-grown author whose Pulitzer Prize-winning book became one of the world's most popular movies, also rode in the parade down the street where she was raised. This time, only a few hundred people gathered in cold, cloudy weather to watch a re-creation of the motorcade. And this time, only 10 minor cast members were in town for the festivities. The two top stars both died in the 1960s, and Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> died in 1949. The parade did n't head for the Loews Grand either. It was torn down after being gutted by fire in 1978. The theater's stand-in for the `` re-premiere'' was the <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, an ornate 1920s movie palace that was restored in the 1970s. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> media mogul who acquired the rights to `` Gone With the Wind'' in 1985 when he bought <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s huge film library, appeared with the cast members at an antebellum ball Thursday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Only about 1,500 of the 3,000 tickets to the ball were sold, but there were plenty of would-be <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Haras </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butlers </PERSON> in the crowd. A replica of <PERSON> Tara </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>'s plantation home, decorated the banquet area. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, whose colorizing of many classic black-and-white movies has made him a controversial figure in the motion picture industry, was dressed in a cream-colored frock coat. As he greeted the ball-goers, he quipped, `` All I can say is, thank God they shot ` Gone With the Wind' in color.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Friday stalled defense attorneys' efforts to have death row inmate <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> released on bail, ending his hopes of freedom by Christmas. The court, which overturned <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s capital murder conviction earlier this week, ruled Friday that a <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> judge would have to prove he had jurisdiction in the case before a bond hearing set for Monday could take place. Defense attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON> said the ruling essentially puts an end to efforts to free <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> before Christmas _ or even before a third trial could take place. `` The announcement of the -LRB- prosecutor's -RRB- filing of a new trial effectively denies any hope of <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> being freed or even coming off death row,'' <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Speers </PERSON> said Thursday he would ask the appellate court to reverse its decision and, failing that, would retry <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> for the capital murder. <PERSON> Speers </PERSON> filed a motion with the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> asking the court to prevent the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> judge from conducting the bond hearing in the meantime. The appeals court said the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> judge would have until Jan. 2 to prove why he has jurisdiction to decide bail for <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>. <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON>, however, said he had decided to withdraw his motion for bail from the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> court. He said <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s release would be stalled until the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> issues a decision on the prosecutor's request that it reverse its decision. `` I'm disappointed that the prosecution has n't gone ahead and dismissed the indictment and instead is seeking to keep <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> on death row while they're asking for a reversal,'' <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>, 38, was convicted in the rape-strangulation of 16-year-old <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fergeson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bellville </LOCATION>, who was killed in 1980 while attending a volleyball tournament at <ORGANIZATION> Conroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court Wednesday set aside the verdict, saying <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> did not receive a fair trial. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>, who is black, was a janitor at the school when <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Fergeson </PERSON> was attacked. Miss <PERSON> Fergeson </PERSON> was white. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON> supporters contend the former janitor's conviction was racially motivated. <PERSON> Brandley </PERSON>'s first trial ended with a hung jury. In the second trial, an all-white jury convicted him of capital murder and sentenced him to death. He has come within six days of execution.

 Police who had stalked him for months killed <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, one of the most powerful cocaine barons, in a shootout Friday near <LOCATION> Covenas </LOCATION>, a port on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, his 17-year-old son <PERSON> Fredy </PERSON> and five bodyguards were killed in the shootout 360 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> at a ranch owned by <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, another kingpin in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s multibillion-dollar drug empire, national police chief <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> said No mention was made of police casualties. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> Friday night and congratulated him and the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> police on the death of the 42-year-old trafficker, Gen. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> said in a television interview. The gunfight was at a ranch only 70 miles south of <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>, the city where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to meet in February with the presidents of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s three major drug-producing countries _ <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maza </PERSON>, commander of the federal investigative police, said police had been pursuing <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, for 70 hours in the Covenas coastal zone before catching up with him. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> was on the list of a dozen Colombian drug traffickers most wanted by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> said telephone switchboards at police stations and the presidential palace were flooded with congratulatory calls. `` The country and the world have received this news with satisfaction,'' he said. `` We know this because of the quantity of calls from citizens, from women crying with joy because the head of the most dangerous and forceful terrorist organization on earth has just died.'' But he said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>'s death would not end terrorist violence in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` We can not say that we have broken the back of organized crime, but since its head has lost its brain, what follows will be a little easier.'' he said. Police will know concentrate efforts to capture <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> said. `` We just need a little luck like we had today with <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, a former pickpocket who leads the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> operation and remains at large, was believed to be in the area of the ranch at the time of the shootout, Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> said in a televised interview. <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> did not elaborate except to say sternly to the camera, `` Individuals who are involved in crime will end up like <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> ended up.'' <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, nicknamed `` El Mexicano'' because of his fondness for anything Mexican, have been the objects of manhunts by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Colombian authorities since <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> ordered a crackdown on drug traffickers after a opposition presidential candidate was slain Aug. 18. Police earlier reported 11 bodyguards among the dead before downgrading that at a news conference to five. `` The operation to locate <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> was an intellegence operation of great care,'' Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Casadiego </PERSON>, assistant director of the national police, said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> radio network. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, national drug control policy director, said <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> told him the news by telephone call. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the fugitives `` resisted police efforts to arrest them, opening fire on Colombian authorities. Colombian police returned fire, killing <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, his son, and 10 or more cartel bodyguards.'' Authorities say <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> planned the Dec. 8 bombing of the federal investigative police headquarters in downtown <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The blast, which left a huge crater, killed 63 people and injured an estimated 1,000 people. The bombing was the most brazen by the traffickers, who have mounted dozens of attacks to retaliate for the extradition of 10 drug suspects to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A total of 209 people have been killed in bombings and assassinations. Among those killed in the bombings have been 50 judges, two newspaper publishers and the chief of the narcotics police. The two men also were accused in the Nov. 27 bombing of a Colombian domestic jetliner just outside <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> that killed all 107 people aboard. In October, the government offered $ 581,000 for the capture of either man. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, who died a billionaire, was a pig farmer before he got into the cocaine business. Among his victims, according to Colombian authorities, was the president of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON>, assassinated Oct. 12, 1988. He also was accused of several massacres of peasants believed to sympathize with leftist guerrillas. He was said to be financing right-wing death squads that have killed hundreds of other leftists. In addition to wars with the government and peasants, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> also fought the rival cocaine cartel in <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, a southern city, and was involved in a struggle with other gangsters for control of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s emerald mines. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> started out in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s second most populous city and about 200 miles from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, as a petty criminal and car thief. Now, <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> ranks him as being worth $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> was indicted in July 1988 with six other reputed drug traffickers by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He was charged with importing 1,350 pounds of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 World leaders and human rights activists heaped praise Friday on <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who sacrificed position for principle, disdained his persecutors and became a universal symbol of the unquenchable human spirit. The 68-year-old Soviet scientist and humanist died Thursday night of an apparent heart attack in his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment. On Friday morning, the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stood in a minute of silent mourning for a fellow member, who first was a national hero for building the hydrogen bomb, then reviled for insisting on human freedom, and finally released from internal exile by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in 1986. One legislator called him a man `` such as maybe appears once in a hundred years.'' President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, with whom <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had several confrontations, said he `` was a man of conviction and sincerity. He was not some sort of political intriguer. He was a person who had his own ideas, his own convictions which he expressed openly and directly. This does n't mean I agreed with him, although on many things we did agree.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` All of us who knew him will never forget his courage and devotion to freedom. In the darkest hours of his struggle for human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he embodied all that is good and decent in the human spirit.'' To <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, prime minister of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was `` a remarkable person. There was this fantastic courage, and among the scientific people there was a tremendous capacity for original thought. `` It did not stop with the science, but went into freedom, liberty, politics and culture. He worked so hard for everything that is coming to pass in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He was one of those who would always say the truth must be found and was never afraid of stating that and letting everyone know.'' `` It is just sad he will not be preeminent in the freer future of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity trade union and a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s death was `` a great loss for reform. ... It is very bad that God's sentences are such. We needed this man.'' In a telegram to <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, he said: `` The wave of reforms that he has fought for flows over all <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today.'' <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, the human rights activist who appears close to becoming the new president of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s work was `` one of the cornerstones of the future European home and worldwide understanding.'' `` A towering figure of his time'' was how <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> described <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. `` His life spanned a period of immense complexity and change in the history of his country,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, Polish Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>, the Dutch premier, were among the many leaders who sent telegrams or praised <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> sent a message to Mrs. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> saying her husband knew `` better than anyone else ... how to reconcile scientific discipline with humanist values. He leaves the memory of a rouser of conscience and indefatigable defender of human dignity.'' <PERSON> Aase </PERSON> <PERSON> Lionaes </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Norwegian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that awarded <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> the Peace Prize in 1975, said he `` fell in the struggle for democratic reforms. His death represents a great loss, especially at a time with hopes of a positive development in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and in all Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Norwegian painter <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparre </PERSON>, an old friend, called <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> `` the greatest reconciler of our century. He gave his life for other people's freedom.'' `` We have lost our moral compass,'' said <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>, former head of the Soviet space program, who worked with <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said: `` We are pained by the loss of the great fighter for human rights, for the rights of Soviet Jews and prisoners of Zion. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> will always be remembered as the man who deserves great appreciation by the Jewish people.'' <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, who spent nine years in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> labor camps and immigrated to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1986, said: `` <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had tremendous influence ... among dissidents, among free people in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and ... by his own personal example helped change the whole climate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Staunton </PERSON>, director of the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> `` represented a whole generation of people ... in what seemed at that time a hopeless situation. Everybody looked up to him, his death is really the end of an era.'' In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, however, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official media Saturday carried only one-sentence reports of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s death without mentioning his role as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s leading dissident. Earlier this week, in protests over the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Tibetan spiritual leader the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, the Chinese press also criticized <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s receiving the prize in 1975.

 An official of a Montana-based church was sentenced Friday to a month in prison and three months home detention for his role in a scheme to buy paramilitary weapons illegally. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quackenbush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, 39, that his crime merited prison time because of his position as a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> and Triumphant of <LOCATION> Corwin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>.

He was accused of giving nearly $ 150,000 in cash and gold to another church member, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, who used fake names to purchase large-caliber semiautomatic weapons and ammunition.

He will be allowed to leave his home only for church services and certain appointments. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> also was fined $ 5,000 and placed on two years of supervised release, meaning he would be returned to prison to serve the entire two years should he violate terms of his release. `` I am extremely sorry for the acts I took and the involvement I had in this,'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> told the judge prior to sentencing. `` There simply is no excuse.'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, the church's reputed security chief, was given three years probation and fined $ 1,000 on Dec. 1 after pleading guilty to a conspiracy count.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> canceled a trip to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and a speech Friday night to the 80th convention of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> because he has laryngitis and there could be bad weather in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Even before the trip was scrapped, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s prepared address had been shortened to about eight minutes because of his ailment. Speaking briefly by telephone to the gathering, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> apologized for not being there and said, `` I will use my office to speak out against racism and bigotry wherever it is found.'' Stepping in at the last minute, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> quoted from portions of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech.

The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a storm warning for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and predicted possible heavy snow, accumulating four to six inches, along with heavy winds.

 A state appeals court has upheld the convictions of a woman who forced her daughter to work as a strip-tease dancer and was prosecuted for child abuse after the girl committed suicide. <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s appeal seeking to overturn her 1987 convictions on charges of child abuse, forgery and procuring a sexual performance by a child was rejected Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, altered her daughter's identification before forcing her to get the job dancing nude at an adult club, court testimony showed Her daughter, 17-year-old <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON>, shot herself to death in March 1986. Testimony at the subsequent trial showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ordered her underage daughter to perform at nude bars, then collected most of the girl's earnings. No date of surrender has been set yet for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has been free on $ 4,500 bail, working as a cab driver. She was sentenced in 1987 to 364 days in prison, followed by two years of house arrest and two more years of probation. `` They shoot horses, do n't they?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said after learning of the appeals court opinion. `` Why do n't they do that with me and get it over with? I wish they would have done it a long time ago.'' The trial was believed to be the first use of a psychological autopsy in a criminal case involving suicide. In rejecting the appeal, the justices approved the use of the evidence in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s trial `` We are satisfied,'' the justices wrote in their opinion, `` that ... the psychological autopsy is accepted in the field of psychiatry as a method of evaluation for use in cases involving suicide, and that the trial judge acted within his discretion in admitting this evidence at trial.''

<HEAD>CBS Finally Signs New Programs Chief</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, facing a third season as No. 3 in prime time ratings, reached agreement Friday with movie executive <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON> to be its new programs chief, sources close to the negotiations said. The move comes two weeks after the resignation of his predecessor, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON>, who resigned as <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> president after only two years in the job. Although <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment and a spokesman for <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON> said `` there is no announcement yet,'' one executive who asked not to be named said <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON>'s hiring would be announced Monday by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>. The delay, the executive explained, was to allow for `` an orderly transition'' at both companies. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, owns <ORGANIZATION> Tri-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON> has been president since March this year. CBS' agreement with <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON> had been expected. But it was delayed by extended negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> for the release of <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON> from his Tri-Star contract, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> officials have said. Ironically, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> previously considered him for the job before deciding on <ORGANIZATION> LeMasters </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON> was wooed again before and after <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' unsuccessfully bid last week to lure to its vacant job a top TV production team, <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carsey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>. Their company makes <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne,'' the nation's two highest-rated series <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON>, who will be responsible for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' entire program schedule, faces a large task of restoration in coming months at the once-dominant network that last month suffered its worst-ever November ratings. Although its daytime schedule emerged first in the November ratings `` sweeps,'' CBS' prime time programs, late-night `` The <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON> Show'' and `` CBS This Morning'' all were third in network ratings. However, the morning program, usually third in ratings even when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> enjoyed prime time success, showed slight improvement when its ratings were compared with those of November last year. In prime time, though, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> slipped two-tenths of a ratings point in November. It averaged a 12.0 rating, a full ratings point behind <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and 3.1 points behind first-place <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. A ratings point represents 921,000 homes, and in prime time can be worth between $ 120 million and $ 140 million annuallly to a network. The results of the quarterly sweeps periods are most important to affiliates, which use them to set their own advertising rates for the next three months. Although some CBS programs like `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'' and the recently returned `` Beauty and the Beast'' have gotten critical praise, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has n't had a hit series since the debut of `` Murder, She Wrote'' in 1984. In news, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>'s `` CBS Evening News'' broadcast, once usually first in ratings, also is showing signs of slipping. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' has won in ratings for the last two weeks. In the last ten weeks, that broadcast, anchored by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, has won eight times and tied twice with Rather's program in the Nielsens.

 <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> has withdrawn financial support for its coveted $ 200,000 World Food Prize, given yearly to a scientist for agricultural research in Third World countries, company officials said Friday. `` Funding for the prize was always decided on a year-to-year basis,'' said <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON> in a telephone interview. `` We believe the award should succeed in establishing broad-based support from other corporations.'' The 3-year-old prize has been awarded to scientists for achievements in developing new crops and livestock systems to help feed underdeveloped regions of the world. The announcement of the funding cut-off came nine months after <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> merged to form Glenview-based <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>.

Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, who won the award in 1988 for his work as director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, said losing the annual prize could mean fewer important discoveries. `` It's a stimulation and something to be hoped and aimed for,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, 82, said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Clermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, home. This year's prize was awarded to Dr. <PERSON> Verghesi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurien </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for pioneering work in establishing a dairy cooperative system.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is eager to enter into oil well service contracts and joint ventures with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> petroleum producers, Soviet officials told oil and gas executives. The 11 Soviet petroleum officials were on a two-day trip to the oil-rich <LOCATION> Permian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> in west <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to see how Americans pump hard-to-get oil from the ground. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is the world's largest oil producer, but increasingly is having problems recovering crude from marginal wells `` If we are able to execute one joint venture tonight, we will have considered our mission here to have been a success,'' <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Vershinin </PERSON>, senior engineer for a Siberian oil - and gas-producing region, said at a vendors' reception Wednesday night `` I am absolutely certain we can work together,'' said <PERSON> Vitali </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasnichi </PERSON>, senior engineer for the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> and Gas, adding that both sides can learn from each other.

Secession has long been sought by some residents of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s smallest borough, who complain they have little voice in city affairs compared to residents of more populous <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, nearly 14 miles long and 7 miles wide, is 2 -LCB- times the size of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Yet the 400,000 mostly middle-class residents of the island are only a fraction of the city's 7 million residents. `` I want to congratulate the governor on his prudent decision,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Republican and chief sponsor of the bill. `` It comes as an early Christmas present for me and, I believe, for the people of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.'' The secession movement gained steam last spring with a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s form of government was unconstitutional. <ORGANIZATION> Staten </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> feared that a new government drawn up by a charter revision commission would give them even less power. The secession bill was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> on the final night of its 1989 session, yet was held back from the governor's desk for several months by <PERSON> Marchi </PERSON> The measure was opposed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> officials worried about the loss of tax revenue from <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> residents. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> argued that voters in the entire city, not just <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, should vote on secession. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said that there's `` more than enough time'' to deal with the opponents' objections. He did, however, attach one condition to his signature. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he wants new legislation requiring that any new charter that is adopted by <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> voters also be subsequently approved by the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marchi </PERSON> has agreed to sponsor such legislation next year, said his spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor-elect <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has been an integral part of the city since it joined in 1898. `` The law allows the residents of the borough to reconsider this historic relationship,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said. `` It is my hope that after they complete their evaluation, they will choose to remain part of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatest city.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, who becomes <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> borough president on January 1, said the chances of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> eventually seceding are `` very, very slim'' because if secession benefits the island financially, legislators from other parts of the state wo n't approve it. If it does n't benefit <ORGANIZATION> Staten </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION>, voters there would turn it down, he said. `` So it may be nothing more than a cruel hoax,'' <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, the late deposed ruler of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, was found liable Friday in the 1981 murders of two anti-Marcos activists in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' estate and his widow, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, were ordered to pay more than $ 15 million to the survivors of Silme Donigo and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON>. Family members and supporters of the plaintiffs cried as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> read the unanimous verdicts, and erupted in cheers when the judge dismissed the jurors. The verdicts found <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his widow were part of a conspiracy and were negligent in a way that led to the shooting deaths on June 1, 1981, in offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. A six-member jury deliberated 5 hours before ruling on the involvement of the Marcoses in the shooting deaths of <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION> and Viernes. `` We were informed today that the jury in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> has rendered a substantial damages award against the estate and myself,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` We believe there are important legal issues in this case which will ultimately cause the verdict to be reversed. Our lawyers have been instructed to pursue all appropriate remedies.'' The civil lawsuit was the first of several legal cases against the <ORGANIZATION> Marcoses </ORGANIZATION> to go to trial in this country, according to the Marcoses' attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` I myself thought that the case was one that could not be won,'' <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said. `` There is an appeal already before the court.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Withey </PERSON>, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said he would ask state prosecutors to reopen the criminal investigation in the case. Three men were convicted of murder in 1981 and 1982, but on the theory that <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON> were killed because of an internal dispute in the union, of which they were reform officers. `` Clearly, the foreign head of state of a country has been implicated in crimes committed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Withey </PERSON> said. `` Other countries, such as <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, better not try the same thing in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' Jurors had to decide whether the Marcoses were part of a conspiracy that led to the murders and whether they were negligent in exercising control over their intelligence network. A unanimous verdict on either of those questions was sufficient to find <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' estate and Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> liable and subject to damages. Survivors of <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> were awarded $ 12,794,000, while <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON>' survivors were ordered to receive $ 2,254,000 Attorneys for victims' survivors had asked jurors to calculate the Marcoses' liability at about $ 10 million. The civil trial had a lower standard of proof than the `` beyond a reasonable doubt'' proof required in criminal trials. The conspiracy count required a showing of `` clear, cogent and convincing'' evidence, and the negligence count a showing of a `` preponderance'' of evidence. <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> will judge liability of the other defendants: <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Baruso </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> who allegedly paid the murderers and whose gun was used in the killings; Dr. <PERSON> Leonilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> friend who allegedly ran an intelligence slush fund that financed the murder payment; and the three men convicted of the murders. Prosecutors who convicted the three in 1981 and 1982 contended <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and Viernes were killed because of an internal union dispute. They had been elected as reformers of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and reportedly had worked against gang influence on work assignments and gambling in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> fish canneries. But plaintiffs claimed the men were killed by an intelligence network, headed by the Marcoses, that harassed and intimidated activists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who opposed the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' martial-law regime. In testimony during the 3 -LCB- - week trial: _ <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, in a video made before his death, admitted he used four agencies to gather intelligence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> But he insisted they did nothing more than the normal intelligence gathering of all nations, that he practiced `` maximum tolerance'' of his opposition, and that he did n't become concerned about dissidence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> until about 1984. _ <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> described <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON> as a friend, but invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when asked about any intelligence connections with <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Mabuhay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which allegedly was a cover for a slush fund that provided $ 15,000 for the murders. The Marcoses face several other legal cases against them. In October 1988, the Marcoses were charged in a criminal indictment with siphoning more than $ 100 million from the Philippine treasury and funneling it into this country for the purchase of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate and art. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcoses </PERSON>' trial is scheduled to begin March 14 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said several claims also have been filed in various cities in which individuals are suing the Marcoses because of torture or other abuses they allegedly sustained during the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> regime.

 Air fare increases that all took effect on the same day last fall are now being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for possible antitrust violations. Government and industry officials said Thursday that several airlines have been ordered to supply documents and information about their ticket-pricing procedures. The focus of the inquiry apparently is a system that allows one air carrier to signal its intention to raise fares, giving others the opportunity to follow suit before the increase actually takes effect. On Sept. 8, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> filed increases in fares into computerized systems read by thousands of travel agents and other airlines. By the time the increases took effect on Sept. 29, several other airlines had matched the hike, with fares up $ 10 to $ 80 depending on how many days before departure tickets are purchased.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Near yuletide last year, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Palin </PERSON> was returning to his <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> home and family. He recalls the joyous cries of his children, to wit: `` ` Got any presents?' I said, ` I've been traveling light.' He sighs. `` The shopping. That was far, far worse than traveling around the world in 80 days.'' Which is what the merry-faced member of <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON>'s Flying Circus had been doing for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He emulated the famed globe-trot of <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Verne </PERSON>'s fictional <PERSON> Phileas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogg </PERSON>, traveling only by land and sea. He went by train, cargo ship, dhow, ferry, taxi, camel, even a passing sheik's new red Mercedes. No jumbo jets, though. He did n't mind: `` I find air travel highly overrated, usually late, and a sheeplike form of transport. Starting Jan. 7, `` Around the World in 80 Days,'' a seven-part documentary series about his expedition, will be shown Sundays on cable's <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which bought it from the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>. Since his Python days, <PERSON> Palin </PERSON> has been in various movies, some, like `` Time Bandits'' and `` A Fish Called <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>,'' with <PERSON> Python </PERSON> pals. He also has been writing, including a tome for tykes, `` Small <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and the Toothache Pills.'' He made a well-received <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> series on train travel in 1980. But his round-the-world voyage, filmed with a crew of five, was, as a <PERSON> Python </PERSON> would say, something completely different. What to wear was only the start. `` There's no shop like <ORGANIZATION> ` </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circumnavigators </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>,''' he notes. `` But the idea is to take as little as possible.'' For him, this meant six shirts, three pairs of trousers, and a small bag containing tapes and a diary book. World travelers have been known to unwillingly visit the wretched nations of Dysentary, <PERSON> Hepatitis </PERSON>, and Mysterious Ailment. So <PERSON> Palin </PERSON> got an armful of shots, having queried a glober-trotter who advised: `` Just take everything.'' He set off from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in the fall last year, proceeding eastward via the <ORGANIZATION> Orient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, then varied forms of transport, among them an elderly dhow whose engine failed at midnight in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>: `` It sort of fizzled out, and the captain sort of scratched his head and said, ` Oh, the rubber band broke.''' <PERSON> Palin </PERSON>, who at one point suffered food poisoning and several times found himself behind schedule, also faced much suspicion by gimlet-eyed border guards in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. At such times, he says, it's often best just to say, `` I'm on a journey, going somewhere else.'' One guard asked <PERSON> Palin </PERSON> why he was in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> if going to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. He was told: `` Oh, well, that's a long story, do n't want to bore you.'' The gate was raised. Off went <ORGANIZATION> Palin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, proceeding to <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, where he got a shave from a blind barber, thence to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and the Mysterious Orient. That included a hydrofoil trip up <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and dinner at a small cafe that served only the meat of poisonous snakes: `` They bring the snake to you in a little box, set it down on the floor, and execute it then and there. A fast, modern cargo ship brought him across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and the forever-docked Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, where he spent a night. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> carried him _ save for a hot-air balloon ride in the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> _ to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He got home by ship. The worst part of the whole voyage? <PERSON> Palin </PERSON> smiles. `` Well, getting back to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was the worst part of the journey, getting back just before Christmas. There was a lot of real mean spirit about the place. I do n't know if I was tired or something. `` But people were Christmas shopping and pushing each other, there were ads everywhere and bands playing and electric bells ringing. `` It seemed just utter madness after what I'd been through, which was quite a long sea journey, something calm and quite reflective. It was as if my country did n't match up after a world of hospitality.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s brain is on a shelf. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s elephant and Tears for Fears' sun are tucked away elsewhere at music video director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON>'s studio. The brain is clay, and appears in the video for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s song, `` Leave Me Alone.'' The elephant, which stars in the `` Boy in the Bubble'' video, is a photograph acquired from a 1950s movie. And the sun is really a 3-inch paper cutout, stuck to a wall since its appearance in the `` Sowing the Seeds of Love'' video. In the four years since <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blashfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Associates began making music videos, the director has raked in awards, as well as business from such musicians as <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Memorex </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and even `` Sesame Street.'' `` He's one of the top five video makers,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayeroff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> division. `` I deal with this stuff every day, so I know how good this guy is. So much of what we see in videos is stupidly exploitative, but his work is sort of a psychedelic celebration. It makes you walk away and say, ` Geez, that was interesting.''' The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> piece took a Golden Lion award _ the highest honor _ in the category of commercials, short films and videos at this year's <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>. It also won the 1989 MTV award for special effects. <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> nominated that reel in five other categories, and has nominated other Blashfield videos. `` Sowing the Seeds of Love'' was No. 1 on <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>'s Top 20 Video Countdown in October. <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON>'s style features colors from some otherworldly Crayola box, coins and globes spinning through space, and flying people. `` Essentially, you're making up reality,'' <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON> said. In the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> video, the star moves through a surreal world of floating chairs, huge chomping teeth and amusement park rides. It took 25 people six months to make the video, which clocks in at 4 minutes, 45 seconds. It features photo collage animation, using 24 photographs per second and a total of 6,840 photographs. <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON>'s videos are n't just giant grab bags of weird objects on film. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> video tells a story: <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has become an amusement park and has been tied down like Gulliver by the nuisances that come with megadoses of fame. <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON> got started in the music video business in 1985, with the hit video for Talking Heads' `` And She Was.'' On a whim, his former producer and current houseboat-mate, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsland </PERSON>, sent a copy of their 12-minute `` Suspicious Circumstances'' film to Talking Heads' management company. <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON> got a call a few days later asking if he would like to make the video for `` And She Was.'' He and his staff _ mostly part-time temporary employees and some free-lancers _ had just 28 days to make it. `` It looked like it might be impossible,'' <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON> said. He got so nervous about the production that he once woke up in the middle of the night thinking, `` Oh God, what have I gotten myself into? Did I actually say I knew how to do this?'' <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON> described work on the videos as collaborative, with producers handling finances and client relations, supervising production and helping with creative work. Also involved are animators, photographers, artists and production assistants. `` My job is to come up with ideas and kind of guide people,'' he said. Until the Talking Heads video, <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON> had been barely supporting himself with local commercials and documentaries, animation and experimental films. He is 45 now, but his fling with film began at 19. <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON> had acted in high school and college productions, and met a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> filmmaker, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rausch </PERSON>, through a play. `` I thought, ` God, I could actually make those things that go up on the screen,''' he recalled. He often looks at photos or objects to develop ideas. `` Sometimes I can see things in my head, but very often my head is not loaded with images. Once you get a seed of something, it reminds you of things.'' Ideas also come from <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON>'s musician clients, with whom he confers by telephone and in person. Later, his staff spends two or three days getting the musicians on film. <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON> and company went to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to film <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` flying'' in a toy rocket at a soundstage, but <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> for shooting. There's no need to move to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to be at the top of his profession, <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON> said. `` I'm in a really fortunate position. What you'll find in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> now is a lot of people trying to figure out how they could live in a place like <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and still do national-based work.'' <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON>'s clients must meet his personal standards. Tears for Fears qualified. `` Sowing the Seeds of Love'' is a humanitarian song with spiritual overtones. The video includes a striking, seemingly three-dimensional scene of a multifaceted mandala _ a circular form symbolizing the universe in Eastern religions. `` These guys are very interested in matters of the spirit,'' <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON> said. `` And I find that I am increasingly, too. ... I'm starting to look around for where the other dimension to life is.

 AIDS may rob its victims of their health and eventually of their lives, but volunteers are making certain the disease does not deprive them of their loving pets. The Pet Owners With AIDS <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, called POWARS for short, provides food, fun and foster care for the dogs, cats and other pets of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> AIDS patients who are too sick to care for them. `` People's first concern has to be themselves. Once they're attended to, it's time to think about their pet,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON>, founder of POWARS `` By the time they get to us, they've been through a nightmare of federal, state and local red tape. We're trying to take the chaos out of somebody's life,'' he said. <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> laboratory technician with two <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> terriers, founded <ORGANIZATION> POWARS </ORGANIZATION> in May 1988 with $ 2,000 of his own money. Now, he and about 200 volunteers help care for some 30 cats, 20 dogs, a bird, a ferret and fish _ the number of pets grows each week. Some clients get monthly food deliveries, while others need occasional or constant litter-box cleaning, supplies, grooming and walking. Some veterinarians donate their services, as well. A few clients pay $ 10 or $ 15 a month; most get supplies and services free, thanks to donations to the tax-exempt group. When a client is hospitalized, volunteers care for his or her pet in its own home or a foster home. Permanent homes are sometimes found when patients die. `` It brings tears to my eyes, the organization is so wonderful,'' said <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> woman with AIDS-related complex who asked that her last name be omitted. `` I know how much love I have for my animal. I depend on her; there's not as much intimacy with people, sometimes,'' she said of <PERSON> Suzie </PERSON>, her 3 -LCB- - year-old mixed Maltese-Yorkshire terrier A friend persuaded <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> to call POWARS for help. She resisted, at first, because `` I had a lot of pride. I want to walk her as much as I can.'' Now POWARS provides food, grooming and veterinary care for the fluffy white dog. `` When I saw how accommodating, nice and sincere they were, I could let the help in,'' <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> said. `` It's possible I may need more of it sometime down the line.'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, who has AIDS, gets help with his 10-year-old Yorkie, <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>. Last summer, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> was distressed about unemployment and medical bills. `` On top of that, I was worried about the dog,'' he said. Then he learned about POWARS. The service provided minor eye surgery for <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>, `` something I could n't afford. It's a comfort to know he is well. I can be better; part of it is stress,'' he said. `` I love this dog. He's my friend and foe,'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> said, playfully shaking the tiny dog, who clearly adored him, too. `` He makes me laugh. He's a little pal. It's better than living with humans sometimes.'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> had a heart attack in January. `` When I got out of the hospital and I saw my dog, I cried. Everything else is dispensable.'' A neighbor took care of <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> that time. But <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> feels confident that POWARS will be there if a friend ca n't be. Another client's relatives asked POWARS for help. The man was hospitalized and unable to move. `` He talked about his dog, so the nurses and doctors decided the dog could be brought to the hospital,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Persky </PERSON>, a POWARS volunteer. `` The dog came up to his room and jumped on his bed. The gentleman sat up for the first time,'' said <PERSON> Persky </PERSON>. `` It's more than a bond; it's a healing process.'' A trainer teaches volunteers obedience commands and suggests solutions when a pet exhibits behavior problems. Animals feeling stress because of their owner's illness often relax once they're put on a schedule, <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON> said The volunteers are screened to make sure they're sensitive to the needs of animals and humans. `` Asking for help is having to share your animal,'' said <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON>. `` We try to be as non-intrusive as we possibly can. Everybody's needs are different.

<HEAD>No Guarantees With Forecasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Decade-ahead forecasts have the potential of landing far off the mark, and generally they fulfill it. Remember those 1960 forecasts of the checkless society? The cashless society? Everyone can cite special examples. Did anyone in 1970 foresee the incredible double-digit inflation and 20 percent interest rates? Of course not. And if seers in the early 1980s foresaw seven straight years of economic expansion nobody heard them shouting. And the 1990s? Will there be a `` Marshall Plan'' for Eastern bloc nations whose economies have been stymied by central planning? Will European economic integration succeed? Your guess is as good as the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s. Much of what can indeed be forecast is demographically based. You can, for example, expect the number of Americans over age 65 to grow rapidly and baby boomers to become middle-aged. That much is in the numbers. It is clear also that recent immigrants will play an increasing role in business, a reality borne out by statistics. By the year 2015, for example, Hispanics will comprise the largest minority segment of the population. It is likely also that older people will continue to work, if their companies let them, because of health improvements and growing life spans. And that many of them, and younger workers too, will work from home. The latter is based on a continuation of existing trends, which show both business and individuals utilizing technology _ computers, copiers, facsimiles, telephone lines, answering machines _ to transport data rather than people. In 1988, according to <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a market research firm, 4.2 million Americans began working at home for the first time, up from 2.4 million in 1987. Link foresees more than 30 million in the 1990s. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanow </PERSON>, a small-business consultant, believes many workers will have their own businesses. He sees them providing work more efficiently for larger companies, and even becoming capable of competing with them. `` It's not just young entrepreneurs working from home anymore,'' says <PERSON> Sanow </PERSON>, president of Business Source, based in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area. `` Even large corporations have innovative home work programs to fit employee needs.'' Believing the trend will continue, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employs <PERSON> Sanow </PERSON> as a spokesman for its Toll-Free 800 Business Directory, which has grown from 20,000 listings in 1984 to more than 120,000 in the latest edition. As <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T sees it, the growth of toll-free numbers also permits small businesses to operate nationally. As callers, it makes it easy for them to acquire information, goods and services inexpensively from anywhere. As owners of an 800 listing, it permits them to advertise widely and accept sales from any part of the country. In spite of such forecasts, and in fact the likelihood that they will be correct, nobody can say for certain that working at home will continue to grow as anticipated. Some other development, inconceivable now, could thwart it. But it is such demographically and actuarily based forecasts that seem most likely to come true. If in 1989 there are a certain number of people aged 60, it can be fairly well predicted how many will be 70 in 1999. Combined with current trends, such as the work-at-home movement and the development of technology that makes it more efficient to transport information than people, such forecasts have at least a fair chance. A better chance, certainly, than those economic forecasts about inflation and recession which carry guarantees that, at best, are good for a few months.

<HEAD>Of Life and Death and Compound Q</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Once a week for three weeks, AIDS patient <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> sat for four hours in a doctor's office near his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> home receiving a drug smuggled from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. That this treatment was not government-sanctioned did not concern him. Nor did he have second thoughts when two others in the trial died. For <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON>, the decision to participate in this renegade test of the drug known as Compound Q was a matter of his own life and death. `` I'm a 48-year-old man and if I do n't do something, I doubt that I'm going to see 50. That is not acceptable to me,'' <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I may go down, but I'm going to go down fighting.'' <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON>, a playwright, said he feels the government has failed him by not moving more quickly to get promising AIDS drugs to him and the tens of thousands of others with the disease or its early symptoms. But he and other AIDS activists are not so quick these days to heap blame on the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the government agency that decides whether new drugs are safe and effective enough to be marketed. Although people with AIDS remain frustrated by the weight of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy, `` there's a little more willingness to believe in their good will'' in light of several new drug approvals this year, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> of the New York-based AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. Many, however, say it is the determination of AIDS patients like <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> that has pushed the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to relax the rules and speed the process that still averages more than four years to grant approval to a drug. <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> said treatments last June with Compound Q, derived from the roots of Chinese plants similar to cucumbers, appear to have slowed progress of his disease and gave him more energy and an improved appetite. But he said the benefits waned and he hopes to resume treatments soon. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, organizer of the underground study begun in May, announced in September that test results indicated Compound Q had `` a significant effect'' and could be valuable in combination with other drugs. An FDA-approved study of Compound Q is being conducted elsewhere in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> and others said it was running far behind the secret experiments. `` If you're talking about a cure for dandruff, I'd say OK,'' <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> said. `` But you're talking about a life expectancy of 16 months. ... It would have been a year from now before they -LRB- researchers in the official trial -RRB- found out what we found out in six weeks.'' When the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> learned of the secret trials, it did not crack its regulatory whip, as might have happened before, but took a more conciliatory approach. The agency invited <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> to bring his data to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and talk about conducting further trials under <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> sanction. <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, in a move reflecting the growing cooperation between AIDS activists and the government, accepted the offer and agreed to stop the trials and retreatments of patients until new trials were approved. `` You have to adjust the rules for the reality of the epidemic,'' <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> has said. `` Where the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has been slow is in changing the height of the hurdle, accepting the need to make adjustments, but I think we may be getting there.'' `` The epidemic of AIDS is extraordinary and must be met with extraordinary measures,'' then-FDA Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said earlier this year in announcing his agency's decision to expand availability of the anti-AIDS drug dideoxyinosine, known as ddI, while still in the early stages of testing. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> says a study shows it has shaved more than three years off the average time it takes to move a life-saving drug from initial tests to approval, cutting the period to about 4.2 years. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppinger </PERSON>, deputy associate commissioner for planning and evaluation, said most of the time saved comes from more efficient clinical trials and speedier delivery of test results to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. Last year, the agency said desperately ill patients can import drugs approved in other countries but not here. Regulators also are helping move drug tests from university medical centers and government research laboratories into neighborhood clinics accessible to more patients. In explaining the relaxation of some of the rules that had stretched the time needed to prove drugs safe and effective, Young spoke of the urgency facing AIDS patients: `` These are people that have no alternative therapy, so that medicine becoming available as early as possible really makes the difference between life and death.'' Throughout his illness, <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> said, he has researched all available therapies, keeping up on the approved drugs, looking for clinical trials of promising drugs and finding all he could about untested therapies. `` I'm not advocating going off willy-nilly, popping things in your mouth,'' he said. Rather, he is following his belief in individual responsibility, using personal judgment rather than waiting for the government to act. `` Safe and effective is a meaningless phrase for me, because I'm going to die of AIDS before they know what safe and effective is by their route,'' he said

 From the blue-collar housing projects of cockney east <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to the gardens of the gentry, grown men scan the skies for hours most weekends, waiting for their pigeons to race home. They rhapsodize about pigeon racing, the sport known as `` the fancy'' and now one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s more popular pastimes. `` All you see is a pinprick in the sky,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Camilleri </PERSON>. `` They fly toward you and you hope its yours. Then they fold their wings, they drop out of the sky, they literally do. They come straight down like bullets.'' Says <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who has 60 pigeons: `` Unless you're a pigeon fancier, you just find it very hard to understand, to see a person out in the garden, like me yesterday, bucketing down with rain, looking for pigeons to come from 100 miles. `` With pigeons I find one thing and one thing only: You're the jury, you're the prosecution, you are the judge. All that happens down in your backyard is down to you.'' <PERSON> Camelleri </PERSON>, a retired soldier who runs the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pigeon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, estimates <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has more than 200,000 pigeon breeders and racers among its 56 million people. Nearly 2 million pigeons, many with meticulously documented pedigrees dating back several avian generations, are registered with <PERSON> Camilleri </PERSON>'s association alone. The sport has an honorable history: The ancient Egyptians kept pigeons; <PERSON> Hannibal </PERSON> took them over the <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION>; they served in both world wars, carrying messages for the Allied intelligence forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Thirty-one pigeons were awarded the Dickens Medal, the `` <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>,'' in World War II. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, pigeons were traditionally associated with beer-drinking, cloth-capped men, but it has moved upmarket in recent years, attracting lawyers, actors and titans of industry. At the top end of the scale, Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> maintains a pigeon loft. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest pigeon breeder, <LOCATION> Louella </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pigeon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION>, is a high-tech enterprise that paid a world record 77,000 pounds -LRB- $ 120,120 -RRB- in 1988 for the racing pigeon Emerald II. `` That, pound for pound, makes it more valuable than the Derby winner,'' <PERSON> Camilleri </PERSON> said, referring to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most prestigious horse race. Emerald II is moved from one secret location to another, because with the large sums sometimes at stake in bets and prize money, sabotage and pigeon-napping are not unheard of. However, high prices do n't always guarantee success, <PERSON> Camilleri </PERSON> said, and a good racing pigeon can start as low as 20 pounds -LRB- $ 32 -RRB-. `` Stockmanship comes into it, knowing and understanding pigeons,'' he explained. `` They all have their individual characters and what you've got to do is understand their character well enough and encourage them to come home quicker than the next pigeon.'' No one knows exactly how pigeons they find their way home after being released, sometimes hundreds of miles away. `` The sun is definitely one -LRB- factor -RRB- and magnetic field is definitely a second,'' <PERSON> Camilleri </PERSON> said. Research in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> indicates the sense of smell also may help. There's also a very basic urge. Most pigeons in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are kept on the `` widowhood system.'' As soon as a hen and cock produce a pair of young, or squeakers, they're separated. Only the males are raced, and the only time they get to see their hens is when they return to the loft at the end of a race. Each fancier's loft is registered and the distance between it and any of the 200 official British `` liberation sites'' measured to the nearest yard. Pigeons are bundled into baskets, sometimes the night before a race, and taken to the liberation site in air-conditioned trucks. Each wears a rubber band about the size of a wedding ring on its leg with the details of where it came from. The pigeons are all released at the same time. They ascend rapidly, quickly become oriented and head for home. When they land, the fancier removes the rubber band and puts it in a timeclock that is sealed and taken to the local racing club. The flight distance is divided by the time it took to determine who won the race. What is it about pigeons that engenders such passion and loyalty? `` The fascination about it: you get a few pigeons, you start winning races, and from then on it's a lot like horse racing, only cheaper,'' <PERSON> Camilleri </PERSON> said. `` You can pit your wits against nature.''

 Three years ago, a friend talked to <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON> about a project concerning <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> permitted to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after World War II. The director, who makes films about issues _ Greek political assassination in `` Z,'' Chilean government brutality and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> compliance in `` Missing,'' white extremists in `` Betrayed'' _ was immediately interested. He read books on the subject and developed the idea for his new film, `` Music Box,'' in which a lawyer -LRB- <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> -RRB- defends her Hungarian father against accusations of atrocities committed during the war. `` Essentially, I like to do something which has never been made or said before,'' the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> director explained in a recent interview. `` It's the best way for me to do a movie, to deal with a very original subject. `` We in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> used to think most of the war criminals went to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. When I was in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> they showed me places, ` Here,' ` Here,' ` There,' where Nazis lived. <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> also. In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, it was quite secret for the general population.'' Memories of the Holocaust also haunt `` Enemies: A Love Story,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON>'s new film. The director started with <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Beshavis </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>'s novel and filled in his own memories of growing up in the <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> during the 1940s. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON>, a Polish Jew who hid from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> during the war and now lives in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. He is torn among his current wife, <PERSON> Yadwiga </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> -RRB-, a Polish peasant who took care of him while he hid from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Masha </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Olin </PERSON> -RRB-, a fellow survivor with whom he's having a passionate affair; and his first wife, <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Angelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> -RRB-, who has returned after supposedly being murdered by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON>, like Singer _ and <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON> _ was never in the Holocaust. But `` Enemies'' is simply a story, based on second-hand knowledge and a first-rate imagination, the director insisted. `` <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> spoke to many survivors, I'm sure, who must have flooded the streets of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON>, who also has directed `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tonto </LOCATION>,'' `` An Unmarried Woman'' and `` Down and Out in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>.'' `` He probably got the story from talking to more than one survivor, so that people like <PERSON> Masha </PERSON> and her mother and <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> and the person who hid him in the barn _ those are stories he probably heard and made this tale up. `` I met many survivors, had dinner, conversations, whatever. All that I had gotten I gave to the actors while we rehearsed. I had them meet with some of these people, in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' For `` Music Box,'' Costa-Gavras began with non-fiction and built a story around it. In both films, the Holocaust is always present but never on screen, unlike the recently released `` Triumph of the Spirit.'' For <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON>, the subject seemed too large for even the most learned observer. Singer himself wrote: `` From his -LRB- <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>'s -RRB- own experience with <PERSON> Masha </PERSON> and other survivors of the German camps, he knew that the whole truth would never be learned from those who had survived the concentration camps or the wandering through <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> _ not because they lied but because it was impossible for them to tell it all.'' So <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON> deferred to documentaries such as `` Shoah'' and `` Hotel Terminus'' as more appropriate ways to learn directly about that tragedy. Once research was completed, he concentrated on the actual film. <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON> agreed, saying he deliberately confined `` Music Box'' to the present. `` You run the risk of being eaten by the story. In ` Music Box,' there's no particular action, no landscape. It's a very empty movie. It takes place in the present, but with people speaking about the past. How you deal with the past, that's the challenge.'' With such explosive material, it is important to have actors with whom the audience will be comfortable. But balance is necessary; the story always comes first. As <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON> noted, `` Music Box'' is not a `` <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'' film, any more than `` Missing'' is a `` Sissy Spacek'' film or `` Betrayed'' a `` Debra Winger'' film. `` It's not only being known, it's being a good actor,'' he said. `` You're a good actor and you get known. That's the case with <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON> or Debra or <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> and now <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>. You can spoil the story with a big actor. `` We're far away from the actors of the'40s and the'50s. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>. This is over, those kind of mythical stars. Now we go to see an actor playing a character, a real character. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> made her character real.'' <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, acclaimed for his performance on stage in `` Speed-the-Plow,'' and said the actor was ideal for playing `` a Herman.'' `` A <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> is somebody who comes from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, whose father was a rabbi, who's a scholar, an intellectual, who loves women, who's very bright, ironic, and who's sad,'' the director explained `` Ron can play that. Certain other actors, a lot of them do n't have all those qualities They'd have to find them. I'm better off finding someone who already has them.'' `` Music Box'' ends with <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, shattered by what she has learned about her father, embracing her son in back of their lakefront house. With her own innocence gone forever, she can only pass on her knowledge and help her son adjust. `` The theme is about memory,'' <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON> said. `` Of course, the memory goes with the future. She does what she does to save her son, to have her son thinking differently and acting differently. To learn how to live with this.'' <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON> adds his own touch at the end of the film, dissolving from a closeup of <PERSON> Yadwiga </PERSON>'s baby to a shot of the <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> `` Wonder Wheel,'' which can be viewed from <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>'s window. The message is bittersweet: Wounds eventually heal, a new generation is born. But also, the lessons of the Holocaust may be forgotten. `` Out of the baby comes this image of the wheel,'' <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON> said, `` and all through the movie <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> has focused on the wheel in his most contemplative and meditative moments, when he's thinking about God knows what `` The wheel keeps turning, life goes on. The baby is life and life is mysterious. There's man and there's woman, it never ends. Even the Holocaust is absorbed into that circle and the life will go on.''

<HEAD>A Long Dry Spell for Small Stocks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` Think big'' has been much more than just a slogan in Wall Street's bull market of the 1980s. Big deals in big stocks have engendered many a big profit. But there was n't much left over for investors in many newer, smaller companies known collectively in the financial world as secondary stocks. So on the verge of the'90s, while owners of blue chips are wondering whether the market can keep on rising, fans of small stocks are asking a more plaintive question: Is their turn ever going to come? Historically, investors who take a chance on smaller stocks have been rewarded with better returns, on average, than those who opted for the presumed safety and stability of household-name companies. <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, investment management firm, says that sine 1950 small stocks have averaged a total annual return -LRB- capital gains plus dividends -RRB- 2.5 percentage points higher than their bigger counterparts, as represented by <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock composite index. When the market began its long advance in the late summer of 1982, that pattern seemed to be holding. So-called `` junior growth'' stocks in technology and other businesses scored some of the standout gains in the first year of the bull market. But around June 1983 they abruptly stalled, and have failed to catch up. `` During the last 6 -LCB- years, investor indifference to small-cap stocks has been virtually unrelenting,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> analysts observed in a recent report. Since mid-1983, they noted, the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 has been rolling up an annual return of better than 15 percent a year. Over the same span, the Value Line composite index of nearly 1,700 stocks _ which gives greater weight to a broad array of smaller issues _ has posted an average annual gain of 6.9 percent. That showing failed even to match the 7.2 percent annual return produced by three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, which are considered about the safest, most conservative paper investment available. So investors effectively got paid nothing for taking the considerable risks that come with smaller stocks. Many reasons have been cited for this seeming anomaly, including the predominant influence in the market of investing institutions and foreign investors. Both those groups have a notorious predilection for big-name stocks with large numbers of shares outstanding and high visibility in the marketplace. At the same time, individual investors, who represent a primary constituency of the smaller companies, have been shunning investments in individual stocks, opting instead for mutual funds or other choices far removed from the stock market. It is axiomatic on Wall Street that no trend lasts forever, and this one has gone on for a long time. Small stocks are now `` priced at attractive levels compared to the major market averages,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says. Despite their subpar showing in recent years, the firm maintains, small companies still hold an edge over bigger ones in their growth potential, since they start from a smaller base and often are run in a more youthful, venturesome spirit. If a bear market develops, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> cautions, it is quite conceivable that neither big nor small stocks will be spared.

<TEXT>
 It begins with a male actor recounting a romantic date _ dinner by candlelight, conversation by the fireplace. `` Finally, we kissed,'' the actor says. `` Then he asked if I enjoyed safer sex. I have never felt so good about saying yes.'' The city unveiled the 30-second television spot, which ends with the line `` rubber up for safety,'' with much fanfare last summer as part of its latest AIDS education campaign. Months later, viewers of late-night programming on a local cable channel are about the only ones who have seen it. To avoid acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the surgeon general recommended that people learn how the disease is transmitted and how it can be prevented through use of condoms. The sloganeering has changed from `` safe sex'' to `` safer sex,'' acknowledging that no sex practice, including condoms, offers fool-proof protection against AIDS. But getting the message to some of the people most at risk, such as homosexual men or inner-city youths, without offending the masses is difficult at best, say the people charged with creating the ads. Critics of explicit AIDS education campaigns warn they could backfire on health professionals and erode public support. `` I think they're turning people off,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of more than 200 physicians and scientists active in consumer education. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckson </PERSON>, the public health commissioner in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, announced in 1987 that he wanted a sophisticated multimedia campaign similar to those that `` sell <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> tennis shoes to poor black youths.'' The department then argued with city officials and community groups for more than a year over wording on posters; it negotiated with local news outlets and the public transit system, which would not display placards with the word `` condom.'' `` I did not anticipate ... significant opposition at so many different levels,'' <PERSON> Tuckson </PERSON> said. Reaction was negative in some <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> quarters when a social service group, <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, unveiled its AIDS poster. It shows four young men, three with hats and one holding a condom over his head, with the caption `` Be cool. Wear your jimmy hat.'' The group received complaints that by using the term `` jimmy hat'' _ slang for condom and also the title of a rap music hit _ the posters spoke specifically to young people and encouraged them to have sex. `` People who are dying of AIDS and are in their 20s obviously contracted the disease while in their teens,'' <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ABCD </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said in reaction. Nevertheless, the posters, ready in March, did n't make it onto city buses and subways until June, held up by <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> review. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s `` rubber up for safety'' campaign includes two television spots, the one so widely rejected and a second ad that features a talking head: Health Commissioner <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. Two television stations, including the local <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliate, have aired the <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> spot. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Capriello </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Chabrowe, the agency that designed the campaign, said her people went back and forth with local TV stations on the more controversial ad, changing it each time, but the stations still said no. `` They would n't have anything to do with them,'' she said. The city's newspapers have refused to run the campaign's print ads, but they have shown up in subway cars and on station billboards. One uses the headline `` Man-to-Man,'' with the letter `` o'' represented by a rolled-up condom. Part of the goal, <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said, was to reach men who engage in sex with other men but do not consider themselves part of the gay community and thus do not frequent bars or organizations where they would see other AIDS education messages. `` The bulk of the campaign, when it comes right down to it, is in the subway,'' said <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>. <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said she objected to advocating condom use not for moral or `` prudish'' reasons, but because condoms are not 100 percent failsafe even when used correctly. In addition, she said, the ads appear to condone, at least unintentionally, homosexuality or sex outside a monogamous relationship, behavior that many people oppose. `` If they're meant for homosexual men, I think they should be targeted at them and not at everybody else,'' she said. `` I think you end up turning people off and making them less sympathetic.'' As head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroger </PERSON> is responsible for creating AIDS education materials for the public. The first campaign in 1987 offered promotions on the use of condoms for sexually active people. `` In general those were not played by anybody,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said he had since refocused the message of the TV ads, avoiding the word `` condom'' but including a telephone number people can call for information. `` Rather than putting lots of money into messages that would not be seen by anybody, we opted to do less explicit messages,'' he said. Public health officials and the ad agencies say they realize their work is controversial and they take pains not to be `` unnecessarily provocative.'' But <PERSON> Tuckson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> health commissioner, says he feels they have a responsibility to get information on reducing the risk of AIDS to the people who need it. `` This is a society that advertises feminine hygiene deodorant spray and depicts explicit sexual behavior in prime time,'' he said. `` What is offensive and insulting is not to give people information that can help save their lives.''

<HEAD>Some Think Farmers Soon Will Be Panting for 1990 Drought Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If the 1990 wheat crop is already suffering, can calls for federal drought aid be far behind? Probably not, government officials say. A weekly weather and crop bulletin by the departments of Agriculture and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said winter wheat was in `` fair to good'' condition across the country, although <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> wheat aphids were at work in some areas. `` The <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> remained dry'' the week of Dec. 4-10, the report said. `` Snow provided some needed moisture and reduced insect activity in the central and northern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>.'' But farmers in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and other plains states are looking at the possibility of drought for the third straight year. Winter wheat farmers, particularly, are concerned for the crop they planted this fall and will harvest next summer. Collectively, farmers were paid $ 3.9 billion in federal aid for 1988 drought losses and stand to get $ 897 million under 1989 provisions. As of Nov. 30, about $ 319.7 million had been paid out for this year's losses. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., was asked last month about the possibility of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> being asked again for disaster aid if winter wheat faltered because of drought `` I would guess if there is another disaster, we're going to respond,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Now it looks like if we do n't get some moisture fairly soon, it's going to be a repeat performance.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> acknowledged that many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including himself, want farmers to start relying on federal crop insurance to take care of bad harvests, but he said that wo n't happen until lawmakers improve the program. `` Every year we make these statements, ` No more disaster aid. It's going to be crop insurance.' We have n't reached that point yet,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` It may come up in the farm bill next year.'' Last week at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was asked about <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s comments. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> historically is the No. 1 wheat producer. `` If drought conditions persist, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will inevitably look at drought aid. That is as _ you can bank that as easily as death and taxes _ assuredly so,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` And it's unfortunate that dry conditions do persist once again out in the winter wheat producing areas.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is in the midst of writing a new farm bill to replace the 1985 law that expires next year. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the whole question of crop insurance and `` so-called ad hoc disaster assistance programs'' should be reviewed. It was said that disaster aid for farmers in 1988 was hastened by it being a presidential election year. But there were no national elections this year, when a scaled-down relief measure was adopted. Although the number of farmers continues its long-term decline, farmers and their organizations retain considerable clout on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Whether that can translate into political advantage for one party or the other is open to question. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> put it on the line with farmers July 15, 1948, when he accepted his party's presidential nomination in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` Confidence and security have been brought to the people by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> said. `` Farm income has increased from less than $ 2.5 billion in 1932 to more than $ 18 billion in 1947.'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> added: `` Never in the world were the farmers of any republic or any kingdom or any other country as prosperous as the farmers of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and if they do n't do their duty by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> they are the most ungrateful people in the world.'' Some time after his stunning win against the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> that fall, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> noted that he lost four Southern states to `` Dixiecrats'' but carried 13 of the biggest urban states and seven major farm states _ <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.

 A $ 900 million recapitalization plan preserves <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s credit rating at a time of weak profits and layoffs at Wall Street's second-largest brokerage. The deal, announced Thursday, also reduces parent <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s stake to under 50 percent and excludes investor and <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, who was in talks for a minority share in exchange for a large investment. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> confirmed <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s senior debt ratings after the plan was disclosed, removing a major threat to <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s reputation and financial stability. Securities firms need good credit to borrow money for large transactions. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s said the recapitalization plan `` will materially increase <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s tangible net worth.'' `` Continuing efforts to reduce expenses should help boost <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s performance,'' <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s said in a statement. `` However, intensifying competition in the global securities business and a difficult operating environment will remain constraints.'' The recapitalization includes the issue of 20 million new shares of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> common stock, which would raise $ 295 million if sold at Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closing price of $ 14.75 a share. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, which bought its <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> stake in 1981, would buy 3 million shares of the new issue, pumping about $ 44 million into <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>. The travel, credit card and financial services company also plans to purchase <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> cumulative preferred stock with a liquidation value of $ 250 million. In addition, $ 300 million in capital would be raised through two equal stock placements with large institutional investors. Finally, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> would buy <ORGANIZATION> Ayco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> financial counseling subsidiary, for $ 56 million, bringing the total new capital to $ 901 million. The institutional investors were not named, but Wall Street sources said discussions were held to give a minority stake in <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>. `` There were talks. They were preliminary. It really did n't come to terms,'' one source said. The sources, who asked not to be named, said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> had not finalized the outside investors, but they said there would be a number of them. The recapitalization is expected to shore up <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s balance sheet but is not expected to guarantee a turnaround during a time of slumping profits and slow business on Wall Street. The plan would achieve <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>' long-desired goal of reducing its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> to under 50 percent from 61 percent to remove the brokerage's up-and-down performance from its earnings report. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s on Oct. 30 said it was considering downgrading <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s ratings on $ 4.8 billion in bonds and commercial paper because of the firm's low capital, weak profits and exposure in commercial real estate loans and investments, as well as the overall securities industry slump. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> stock has fallen in recent months because of poor earnings. The firm recently began laying off 800 workers to reduce its size to 35,700 employees, reshuffling its senior management and slashing stockbroker commissions for the first time in 15 years. The boards of directors of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> approved the recapitalization plan late Thursday. Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> will remain the largest shareholder in <LOCATION> Shearson </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, currently the second-largest shareholder with 13 percent, would remain in that position, although its new stake would be smaller. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said it expects to record a one-time charge to net income reflecting the difference between the value of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> on its books and the value of its holdings based on the share price. The charge would total $ 60 million at Thursday's share price, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said. Officials said <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> was willing to part with Albany-based <ORGANIZATION> Ayco </ORGANIZATION>, which provides financial planning services to corporate executives, because it fits more with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>' operations. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said it planned to file registration statements with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> early next week on the recapitalization.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman says he will begin an effort to change the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, saying the `` splendid isolation'' of the central bank `` wo n't continue forever.'' `` I recognize the need to give the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> room to operate and make objective judgments,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, a longtime critic of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. `` But, this does n't have to mean ... -LRB- it -RRB- operates as some separate government, free to veto economic policy spelled out by the administration, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people at the voting booths,'' he said Thursday. On another matter, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> prodded President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to re-evaluate the administration's `` Pollyannaish'' view that a $ 50 billion savings and loan bailout is sufficient. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested earlier this week that the $ 50 billion the government is borrowing to close S & amp; Ls through September 1991 may fall short. However, a day later, his spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, backtracked, saying the president had no plans to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for more money. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, offered few specifics on how he would restructure the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, but afterward mentioned expanding the board to include representatives of interests other than banking. Consumers, builders, manufacturers and other groups hurt by high interest rates have long sought more influence over <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy. The seven <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> board members in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are appointed to 14-year terms by the president and once in office can not be removed. The boards of the 12 regional banks that comprise the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> are dominated by members chosen by bankers. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, through most of his 28-year career in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has been frequently critical of the central bank for fighting inflation at the expense of economic growth. When interest rates soared in the early 1980s, he introduced legislation to impeach <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman. A bill introduced this year by Reps. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, would force the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to announce the results of closed-door sessions immediately rather than with the current six-week lag It also would require it to meet regularly with administration officials. However, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the approach was `` fragmentary'' and that he would launch a long-term effort to comprehensively restructure the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, starting with hearings and studies next year and legislation after that. `` The splendid isolation of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> wo n't continue forever,'' he said. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s effort may get some sympathy with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which has complained periodically about the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s tight-money policy Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has suggested that administration officials should have more influence over monetary policy. However, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., and the panel's senior Republican, <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, have said they would oppose any attempt to weaken the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s independence <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has said the central bank's independence serves the country well by giving it the ability to make unpopular decisions that benefit the economy in the long run <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has maintained for nearly a year that more money was needed for savings and loans. He invited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` to look very closely at the situation and to start running those computers overtime.'' `` Bad news may go down a lot better in January than next October with the crisis once again at five minutes to midnight,'' he said.

 Suppliers to department stores owned by financially distressed <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> are taking a cautious approach regarding future merchandise shipments. One of the companies that act as middlemen between manufacturers and retailers, known as factors, said Thursday it no longer would extend credit on goods bound for <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s stores. Meanwhile, several apparel and accessory manufacturers said they were keeping in close touch with executives in charge of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailing operations Bills have been paid on time so far, they said. The suppliers, whose fates are tied to retailers, expressed hope that business would n't be disrupted as <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> copes with a worsening cash shortage. `` I'm very worried about the situation,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Chetta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a clothing maker. `` It gets progressively worse looking every day. I'm taking a wait-and-see posture.'' Retail analysts said disclosures by <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of deepening financial difficulties were unsurprising given the fierce competition in the industry. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied said in documents submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that their cash could run out by March or sooner and that they might seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. The move would permit Campeau-owned retailers to remain operating while their Canadian parent company sorted out its financial problems. At the heart of the trouble is the massive debt <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> acquired in taking over <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> in 1988 for $ 6.7 billion and Allied in 1986 for $ 3.4 billion. A threatened inability to meet interest payments on junk bonds sold to pay for the acquisitions forced the Toronto-based retail and real estate company to turn to outsiders for help earlier this year. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> came to the rescue with a $ 250 million loan to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>. As part of a deal for an additional $ 800 million next year from <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> put the <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s department store chain up for sale in September. About a half dozen bidders are evaluating the chain and <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has said a final sale could be arranged by February. In the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filings, made public Wednesday, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied said bankruptcy court protection would be an alternative if lenders wo n't ease repayment terms. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> owes creditors $ 1.15 billion by the end of April and Allied faces debts of $ 633.7 million due by the end of March. Failing a rescheduling of the payments, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said it would consider selling additional holdings, raising money by taking out mortgages on its stores or possibly seeking bankruptcy-court protection. In addition to the 17-store <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s chain, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> operates <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s. Under the Allied umbrella are The <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marche </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s. Combined, the two have about 100,000 employees and 260 stores. Vendors, such as clothing makers <ORGANIZATION> Bernard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chaus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ellen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claiborne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, that do business with many of the stores said they would continue to monitor developments at <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> and that up to now they've been satisfied with how promptly the company has paid for goods. Another yardstick of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s relationship with vendors could come when some manufacturers seek credit in coming weeks to ship spring merchandise to the stores. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaus </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the ready-to-wear clothing company that bears his name, said: `` We certainly are going to support them on all fronts.'' <PERSON> Chaus </PERSON> added, however, that he assumes <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied stores would `` have some major problems with merchandise shipments.'' <PERSON> Chaus </PERSON> does n't use factoring, which involves companies buying accounts receivable and taking over the job of collecting the money due. The second-largest factor in the country, Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Heller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, shut off credit lines to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> suppliers as of Thursday morning, spokeswoman <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiracek </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> CIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group-Factoring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest in the business, said it was continuing to assess the situation. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Basile </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> CIT </ORGANIZATION> unit, said he was concerned there might be an undue reaction in the retail community. He said the only new development was <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s public acknowledgement that bankruptcy-court protection might be necessary. <PERSON> Basile </PERSON> said in an interview that outsiders have thought all along that was a possibility. But, he noted, `` There's a lot of things that we're going to have to resolve before we can approve any future orders.''

<HEAD>Founder of Company at Heart of Scandal Denies Bribery Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> gave its name to a scandal that brought down a government and tarnished the Japanese establishment, said in court today that he did not bribe politicians and public officials. Also denying bribery charges were <PERSON> Toshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, an executive of Recruit, an information conglomerate, and two politicians: <PERSON> Takao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister, and <PERSON> Katsuya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> of the opposition Komeito -LRB- Clean Government -RRB- party. If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to five years in prison. Their trial is the last of five, which began Nov. 22 in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> and will last for months as the legal system delves into allegations of corruption in in the cozy relationship between Japanese government and business. The Recruit scandal began in summer 1988 and brought down Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who resigned last spring after acknowledging he received large donations from Recruit. Other key figures in the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have been sidelined by the scandal and the honesty of ranking bureaucrats has been questioned because of gifts they accepted from Recruit. <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, 53, told Judge <PERSON> Tadatsugu </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> today he accepted the prosecution's allegations that he provided gifts and bargain-priced shares of stock to influential figures. But he said they were n't intended as bribes `` These events did occur, but I do not agree with the substance of the charges,'' <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> said. `` I had absolutely no intention of committing bribery. ... I apologize for causing social disorder.'' Like the other three defendants, <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> accused prosecutors of mistreating him. `` The prosecutors questioned me from morning to night. When I tried to close my eyes they forced me to keep them open to the point that they hurt so bad that tears were flowing,'' he said. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, 56, was chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary under Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s predecessor. He is accused of receiving the equivalent of $ 140,000 and 10,000 shares in <LOCATION> Recruit-Cosmos </LOCATION>, a subsidiary whose stock was offered to influential people at a reduced price before it was sold publicly. Prosecutors say he put pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> not to change the traditional season for recruiting college graduates, which would have hurt Recruit's sales of job-placement magazines. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> denied the allegations. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> said he had been unaware of both the political donations from Recruit and the share-dealing, which was done by an aide. <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON>, 52, is charged with receiving $ 14,000 for himself, $ 35,000 for his wife and 5,000 shares in Recruit-Cosmos for his brother. According to prosecutors, he gave pro-Recruit speeches in Parliament in return. <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> resigned his seat; <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> remained in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, but resigned from his party. <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, a 39-year-old former company department head who faces two counts of giving bribes, denied the allegation. The other trials involve six bureaucrats and two other Recruit executives. Prosecutors must show the point at which a gift becomes a bribe. Japanese law says bribery occurs when a public official or politician receives money or valuables from people or companies the official is in a position to supervise. Recruit offered millions of discount shares in Recruit-Cosmos to hundreds of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen before the stock was available to the general public. When it was offered on the over-the-counter market, the price of the stock shot up and the insiders made large profits. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>'s shares were said to have gained him $ 215,000 On Wednesday, the former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, 79, acknowledged he made about $ 145,000 in 1986 on <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares he bought before the issue went public, but denied favoring Recruit with special treatment when it entered the telecommunications market. `` I accepted the offer of shares, but I never regarded it as a bribe,'' he said. `` Rejecting such an offer is considered rude in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' Defense lawyers have argued such favors were normal between businesses and the powerful bureaucracy in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where an entire industry has evolved around the custom of exchanging gifts to cement personal and business ties. Businessmen say such gifts are not aimed at winning specific favors but at establishing relationships with business associates, supervising agencies and politicians that make it easier to do business with them.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, the former owner of The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe New Mexican, regained control of it Thursday from <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, less than one month after going to court to block <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to sell the newspaper Thursday's purchase by <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> and his daughter, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, ended a nearly 14-year association <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> had with <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, Va.-based <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, including a bitter nine-year legal battle over day-to-day control of the newspaper. <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> sold the daily newspaper to <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> in 1976. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCorkindale </PERSON>, vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer for <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, told a meeting of security analysts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Thursday the transaction value was in the mid - $ 30 million range <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>'s public affairs director, said the newspaper group decided to sell The New Mexican because `` we felt this was a good idea. I ca n't comment beyond that.'' Neither <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Middleburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, nor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, owner of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Taos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, returned telephone calls to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> seeking comment on the purchase. <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, in a question-and-answer piece scheduled to appear in Friday's editions, said, his relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> `` has been long and stormy. `` In the course of the current negotiations, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>'s conduct has been proper in my opinion and I think that <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> would say that my conduct has been equally proper,'' <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> wrote. `` I think, however, that both of us will now be happier going our own separate ways.'' Among the reasons for buying back the publication, he added, was `` I did not want to see the New Mexican owned by or sold again to another chain operation.'' <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> agreed in September to sell The New Mexican to <ORGANIZATION> Donrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, in a deal valued at $ 35 million, according to court records filed in a lawsuit brought by <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> to block the sale. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> said in court documents it terminated the agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Donrey </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> filed a complaint alleging that <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> had violated an employment agreement with him. The employment agreement, under which <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> remained the newspaper's publisher for five years and editor-in-chief for 10 years, was part of the transaction in which <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> sold The New Mexican to <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> in February 1976. <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> alleged <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> failed to honor a stipulation that if <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> wanted to sell the paper it would have to give <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> the opportunity to purchase it first by matching terms of the prospective buyer's offer. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, in a counterclaim, denied <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>'s accusations and alleged `` bad faith'' by <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> to manipulate his right to refuse an agreement to sell the paper. State District Judge <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said he signed a one-paragraph order Thursday dismissing <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>'s complaint as well as a counterclaim filed by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> at the request of both parties because the issues in the case had been settled. The purchase of The New Mexican, which said it has a daily circulation of 20,088 and a Sunday circulation of 21,189, involved the transfer of 800,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> stock by <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release the shares were being transferred in a tax-free exchange for the stock of The New Mexican. <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, who first bought the newspaper in 1949, was quoted in a New Mexican story announcing the sale as saying department heads, managers and staff members would continue in their present positions. Sale of the newspaper leaves <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> with 82 daily newspapers, including <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>.

Affiliated Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he expects the company will do `` a little better next year'' as the decline in advertising volume levels off, costs of newsprint remain low, previous efforts to cut costs show results and the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> introduces more zoned editions. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> McCorkindale </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>'s vice chairman and chief financial officer, said analysts who were estimating earnings per share in the `` mid - $ 2.40 range are on the right track. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, earned $ 2.26 a share in 1988.

He said his aim was to make the newspaper profitable for all of 1990. The company, which owns more than 80 daily newspapers as well as television ands radio stations and an outdoor advertising company, declined to estimate 1990 earnings. Dow Jones, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said it expects to report 1989 earnings per share of $ 3.13 to $ 3.18, up from $ 2.35 a share in 1988. The publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> said that excluding non-recurring gains, its earnings will be off by about 4 percent to $ 1.49 to $ 1.54 a share for the year from $ 1.65 a share a year earlier. Those results have been depressed by losses connected with the foreign exchange trading service operated by its <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> unit and retrenchments in the financial community that have led to sharp declines in financial advertising volume, said Chairman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which has properties that include its namesake flagship newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, television stations and cable TV operations, said it expects its earnings per share will rise 20 percent to $ 15.50 from $ 12.90 on a pro forma basis in 1988. It said its operating income will be up 33 percent. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, president, said 1990 should be a good year although the company could not hope to reach the same level of earnings growth as in 1989. <PERSON> McClatchy </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and publisher of the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bee </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tacoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and others, expects to reach analysts' earnings estimates of $ 1.15 a share to $ 1.20 a share this year, up from $ 1.02 a share in 1988, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, vice president and treasurer. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> declined to forecast 1990 earnings prospects other than to say they should produce `` good but not spectacular results.'' But he noted 1990 results will be depressed by 20 cents a share due to the recent acquisitions of three daily and two weekly newspapers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and that <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> expects to have a loss of $ 4.5 million to $ 5 million next year on its investment in the startup of a newspaper mill in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French securities regulators will be exchanging more than pleasantries now that they've signed a new mutual assistance agreement to investigate fraud and other market abuses. Under the agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and its <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> equivalent _ the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bourse </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- COB -RRB- _ will assist each other by providing information in their respective files, taking statements from individuals and obtaining documents. Both agencies also agreed, in a separate document, to consult each other `` about subjects of common interest in order to coordinate market oversight and resolve differences that may exist'' between the two countries' regualtory system. The agreement was signed Thursday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> and COB President <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint-Geours </PERSON>. In prepared remarks for the signing, released by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said the agreement provides `` a specific means for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and French regulators to exchange information for use in investigating securities laws violations.'' The statement continued: `` Under the agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> COB </ORGANIZATION> will use their own securities enforcement powers to the greatest possible extent in providing mutual assistance. This will help us to achieve greater stability and integrity in our markets.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investors' transactions in French corporate stock increased from $ 1.2 billion in 1985 to $ 4 billion last year. During the same period, French transactions in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate stock doubled, from $ 6 billion to $ 12 billion. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> noted that he reached a similar agreement Monday with Dutch securitiees regulators. The statement added that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has undertaken several moves `` designed to stimulate international capital formation and cross-border activities of securities professionals.'' They include a July regulation easing registration requirements for foreign broker-dealers to conduct some activities in this country; and a new proposal, Rule 144-A, that would facilitate the sale of foreign securities in the private placement market without normal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> registration procedures. `` Even as we eliminate barriers to international securities transactions. we must be alert to the increased risks of cross-border fraud,'' said <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, adding, `` the agreement signed today strengthens our ability to prevent and detect these types of unlawful activities conducted across national borders.'' The agreement allows either <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or French securities officials to take statements and testimony from individuals in their own country and supply them to the other country's officials. Information supplied to the foreign authorities is to be subject, in most cases, to the confidentiality rules of the supplying country. Unlike the Dutch agreement, the new pact does not confine applicability to French territory in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The agreement, however, limits the exchange of information to events that occurred after the pact goes into effect.

 A $ 150 million federal lawsuit alleges <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> employees saw pioneering <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> graphics programs at a trade show in 1981 and pirated the design to create the revolutionary Macintosh computer. The suit, filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, also alleges then-Apple President <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON> saw a demonstration of another <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> program, Smalltalk, at <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in 1979, and that he and other <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> employees were `` very impressed with the unique and revolutionary user-friendly design.'' Jobs was ousted from <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and founded <ORGANIZATION> Next </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes workstation computers. `` <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> never licensed Apple to use the Star computer program or its distinctive graphics or its unique design and appearance or its unique concept and feel,'' the suit said. It also claims <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> gained unauthorized access by hiring several <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> employees in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including Star software developers. The suit, the first of its kind ever filed by <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>, claims <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s now-defunct <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> computer system and Macintosh Finder, both copyrighted in 1987, were derived from the two <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> programs. Smalltalk was developed in the mid-1970s, and <PERSON> Star </PERSON> was copyrighted in 1981. The lawsuit says <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> employees saw the Star program at the trade show, in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in June 1981, and copied substantial portions in its <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and Macintosh Finder programs, including the design and appearance of the main application windows, dialogue boxes and menu, and some of the exact icons, or symbols, used in the program. Apple was granted a license in June 1981 to participate with <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> in a project to implement Smalltalk into a hardware system to be developed by <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>, the suit said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>, said the civil suit was filed after efforts beginning a week ago to reach an agreement were rebuffed by Apple. `` We sought a settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> and we resorted to these legal means only when it became absolutely necessary,'' said <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Cupertino </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>'s software graphics concepts are not protected by copyright any more than depictions of birds and trees are protected by the copyright on a painting. `` We believe the case is without merits,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carleen </PERSON> <PERSON> LeVasseur </PERSON>. `` The complaint confuses the difference between ideas and expression; the copyright protects expresssion, not ideas.'' She said Apple has always recognized <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> and others as responsible for ideas, including computer graphics devices called mirrors and windows. `` Copyright covers artistic expression but not the ideas. In art, it does not cover the trees and birds in a picture, only the picture ... what <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> has done is take those ideas and spend a lot of money in research and development and make our own original expression.'' The suit, which asks for a jury trial, said the Star program `` is widely recognized in the computer industry as being the first to introduce fanciful desktop workstation graphics to allow the user to interact with the computer,'' a development that took <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> `` millions of dollars and years of creative effort.'' The suit claims a total of $ 50 million in damages from unfair competition under state and federal laws, plus punitive damages under state law of an unspecified amount. It also seeks at least $ 100 million from Apple for unjust enrichment from licenses and royalties for its products. Macintosh graphics replaced complicated word codes with simple symbols, vastly streamlining the way users ranging from schoolchildren to office workers select programs, issue commands and perform other functions. In a similar suit, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the same court in March 1988, claiming infringement of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and the Macintosh Finder copyrights, among others, and alleging both were original to Apple. Apple claimed that <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s Windows 2.03 and a <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> program called NewWave, which is based on it, too closely resemble the `` look'' of screen displays on the Macintosh. A federal judge in July issued a tentative ruling that greatly narrowed <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s suit by deciding the items covered in a 1985 licensing agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> could not be used as evidence against <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s versions of the products.

 Despite worries about the almost uninterrupted rise in the market's key index for the past few weeks, share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> posted a new closing high today, while the dollar remained higher in a narrow range. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 90.34 points, or 0.23 percent, to finish the week at a record closing of 38,271.04. The index's previous record closing was 38,180.70 points set Thursday. It breached 38,000 points on Wednesday, when it gained 258.89 points. The market needed only 16 trading days to see the index gain more than 2,000 points.

<TEXT>
 As <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock continues to tumble, industry analysts are warning investors not to expect any buyout deal for the airline company to develop soon. `` I suspect it probably will drag on for some time because it's not an easy package to put together,'' analyst <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday, one day after <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board announced it was still searching for a deal to boost the company's stock Investors registered their disappointment on Wall Street. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, fell $ 5.50 to $ 163.25 a share Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after dropping $ 8 on Wednesday. Nonetheless, airline industry analysts said they were intrigued by the board's statement that it would seek discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, an investment group that owns an 11.8 percent stake in the company and is pushing for a sale or restructuring. Some said the move could indicate a greater willingess by the board to listen to <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s ideas. But other observers said <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> directors may simply be trying to discern how much clout <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> really carries in its threat to solicit shareholder consents to overthrow <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> would not comment on when a meeting might be held. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON>, one of <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s general partners, said it was impossible to interpret the board's intentions. But he said <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> was concerned about <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s slow progress in putting together a transaction to increase shareholder value. The New York-based partnership says it will launch its consent solicitation `` if and when we conclude it would be advantageous.'' Airline analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> probably would have the support of other stock speculators who suffered steep losses on their <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> holdings when a $ 6.75 billion buyout bid by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management collapsed in October. But <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s three general partners are believed to have little desire to actually take control of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> as they have threatened, since they would then face the same problems that are hampering the current board's efforts to put a deal together. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management has drafted a new employee-buyout plan that reportedly values the company at $ 240 a share, or $ 5.43 billion, but the proposal has not been endorsed by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots or flight attendants, and the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union has said it would oppose such a deal. `` If you're going to have a meaningful <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- employee stock ownership plan -RRB-, you must must have the three unions involved,'' <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON> said. Opposition from the Machinists helped scuttle the $ 6.75 billion pilot-management bid, in which <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> also was to have participated as an equity partner. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> opened a two-day meeting Thursday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to elect new officers. Local President <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Friend </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> announced earlier this month that they were stepping down, a move expected to reduce friction between management and the flight attendants and perhaps smooth the way toward an employee buyout agreement.

<HEAD>Annual Rate Climbs to 7.7 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s annual inflation rate rose to 7.7 percent in November from 7.3 percent in October, pushed up by higher mortgage rates, the government said Friday. The underlying inflation rate, excluding mortgage payments, was unchanged at 6.1 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. The financial markets had little reaction to the latest inflation rate, which was better than had been expected. Economists had braced themselves for a rise to 7.9 percent after Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON> recently announced that more expensive home loans would push the retail price index up. The government has pushed up interest rates sharply to fight inflation, but the policy has the ironic effect of inflating the inflation rate. Major and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> have said repeatedly that fighting inflation is their No. 1 economic priority, and that interest rates will stay high as long as is necessary. Prices rose 0.9 percent in November, the statistical office said. Half the month-to-month rise was the result of the mortgage rates, it said. The index, which uses a January 1987 base of 100, stood at 118.5 in November, 117.5 in October, and 110.0 in November 1988, it said. Mortgage rates have climbed following the government's latest 1 percentage-point hike in base interest rates to 15 percent in October. The statistical office said there was a sharp rise in food prices concentrated among seasonal foods in November, partly because of poor crops caused by the dry summer. There also were price increases in leisure goods and clothing, it said. But there was a small drop in gasoline prices, and some price discounts for alcoholic beverages, it said.

 British brewing giant <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> says it will tap a fast-growing non-alcoholic beverage market with the purchase of a $ 58 million share of <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s carbonated juice business. The companies said Thursday that creation of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Era </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in which each will own a 44.5 percent share, is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The joint venture will make and sell <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sundance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sparklers </ORGANIZATION>. `` In a market that's not growing, we're seeing alcoholic beverage suppliers turn more to non-alcoholic beverages,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON>, associate publisher of the trade publication Beer Marketer's Insights.

A definitive agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> is expected early next year, although that transaction has been challenged by smaller brewers as anti-competitive and also awaits <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> review, <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said.

Guinness already markets non-alcoholic products such as Kaliber lager and <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> malt beverage and wants to expand in that area, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, a spokesman at the company's <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> headquarters. Sundance has more than 50 percent of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> juice and sparkling water market that is growing at 20 percent a year, <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said.

 Stock prices were mixed today as the market absorbed the impact of the quarterly `` triple witching hour.'' The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 15.36 to 2,738.27 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 666 up, 420 down and 629 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 73.51 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Prices were buffeted around a bit by orders from professional traders engaged in computer-program strategies involving individual stocks and a series of expiring options and futures on stock indexes. The witching hour, which comes on the third Friday of the last month of each calendar quarter, did not appear to have more than a passing effect, however. Analysts said investors also seemed uncertain what to make of a spate of new government figures on the state of the economy. Reaction was mildly positive to news that the producer price index of finished goods dropped 0.1 percent in November.

 Stock prices fell today as the market absorbed the impact of the quarterly `` triple witching hour.'' The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.74 to 2,741.89 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 545 up, 729 down and 573 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 99.40 million shares at midmorning. Prices were buffeted around a bit by orders from professional traders engaged in computer-program strategies involving individual stocks and a series of expiring options and futures on stock indexes. The witching hour, which comes on the third Friday of the last month of each calendar quarter, did not appear to have more than a passing effect, however. Analysts said investors also seemed uncertain what to make of a spate of new government figures on the state of the economy. Reaction was mildly positive to news that the producer price index of finished goods dropped 0.1 percent in November. But a separate report showed a widening of the nation's trade deficit to $ 10.20 billion in October from a revised $ 8.51 billion the month before.

<HEAD>Outflows Slow From Junk Bond Funds Though Bad News Keeps Coming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investors have slowed their stampede from junk-bond mutual funds in recent weeks as a revisionist school of thought on the risky investments has emerged. It goes like this: Junk bond prices are so low that they can only go up, and the generous yields on the bonds more than compensate for any risk that the bonds will default. `` I think what we've probably attracted are some bottom fishers,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Litvack </PERSON>, a spokesman for mutual-fund operator <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of people have felt that the correction has taken place, the headlines are positive, and they're going to come in at a decent share price. Investors began pulling out of junk bond mutual funds in late summer, apparently due to news reports of trouble at highly indebted junk bond issuers such as casino operator <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and department store owner <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. For example, the junk-bond fund run by <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rowe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> lost 28 percent of its assets from Sept. 1 through Nov. 30., though some of that was due to a decline in the price of the But Price and other operators of major junk bond mutual funds say they've seen a slowdown in outflows in recent weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>'s fund even saw a net inflow of money two weeks ago `` There might be a contrarian undercurrent out there that, given the very high yield, it might be commensurate with the risks involved,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, another mutual fund operator. Junk bonds are issued by companies that have a poor credit rating or no rating at all. They also are used to fund leveraged buyouts. Because of their risk of default, they yield more than investment-grade corporate bonds. Junk bonds are no place to put retirement savings. At best, they are suitable for surplus funds that an investor is willing to lose should the gamble falter. Many advisers say small investors should steer clear of them under any circumstance. But recently, as the prices of junk bonds have hit new lows, some experts have proclaimed them a good investment despite the fact that some of the bonds may default. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swingle </PERSON>, the manager of <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rowe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION>'s junk-bond mutual fund, said earlier this month that he considers the high-yield market `` one of the most undervalued capital market sectors.'' `` In our opinion, today's negative environment for high-yield bonds is a window of opportunity for the long-term investor,'' he said. Mutual fund operators say junk-bond funds react sharply to news reports about junk bond issuers and the high-yield market in general. <PERSON> Litvack </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.45 billion junk-bund fund is the most news-sensitive he's seen. `` What it tells you is that people are not terribly secure about that investment,'' he said. A recent <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> story headlined `` The New Lure of Junk Bonds,'' which described how some money managers see values in junk, may have stimulated junk fund investments. But headlines last week about <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s assertion that it might have to place its department store divisions in bankruptcy reorganization had the opposite effect. <PERSON> Litvack </PERSON> said an investor in a junk fund that pulls his money based on news reports `` might be better off elsewhere. This fund is not for people who are faint of heart.'' Junk fund operators say they take pains to warn potential investors of the risk. But the risk has its reward: <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 946 million junk-bond fund yielded 13.24 percent last week, compared with 7.92 for its <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> fund, a benchmark for safety. However, junk fund yields have varied wildly from year to year, making a junk fund suitable for long-term investors only. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION>'s fund yielded only 2.65 percent in the year ended Sept. 30, 1987. But in the year ended Sept. 30, 1988, it yielded 13.55 percent. `` One year of negative returns can be fully expected with this type of fund,'' <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Cold Weather Helps Boost Soybeans; Grains Open Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices rose moderately in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, bolstered by cold-weather concerns, but grain futures were mixed. Frigid temperatures in the nation's mid-section have supported the soybean market all week amid perceptions that the cold has boosted demand for soybean meal as a high-energy livestock feed. This morning's temperatures were among the lowest yet this season, with sub-zero readings across <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and much of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The cold snap also supported the corn market, but wheat prices were slightly lower amid profit-taking after moderate gains in the past week. The cold weather was expected to continue for at least another week but analysts said its influence would fade if new export business emerges. `` It's a market that's waiting for more Russian business, that's the best way to characterize it,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s floor operations at the Board of Trade In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.15 \ a bushel; corn was unchanged to \ cent higher with December at $ 2.35 \ a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $ 1.55 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents higher with January at $ 5.85 a Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle futures were .10 cent to .22 cent higher with December at 77.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent lower to .40 cent higher with January at 83.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .12 cent lower to .33 cent higher with December at 52.85 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .43 cent to 1.20 cents higher with February at 50.75 cents a pound. Livestock futures ended mostly higher on Thursday while pork bellies fell.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Shows Biggest Imbalance in 10 Months</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 3 grafs with Fitzwater comment after 9th graf, The drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Thea </PERSON> nation's merchndise trade deficit soared to $ 10.2 billion in October, the biggest imbalance in 10 months, as imports climbed to a record level, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the October deficit was 19.8 percent higher than the September imbalance of $ 8.51 billion. The worsening trade balance reflected a big jump in imports, which climbed 5.1 percent, to an all-time high of $ 41.21 billion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports were also up, by 1.1 percent, rising to $ 31.01 billion. The trade deficit is the difference between imports and exports. A worsening in the trade deficit had been expected, given the fact that imports normally shoot up in October as merchants restock shelves in preparation for Christmas. However, the size of the increase caught many economists by surprise. For the first 10 months of the year, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit is running at an annual rate of $ 109.4 billion, down a modest 7.7 percent from last year's deficit of $ 118.53 billion. The overall October deficit of $ 10.20 billion was the largest since a $ 10.80 billion deficit in December 1988, although the August imbalance of $ 10.10 billion was nearly as high. In brighter economic news, wholesale prices, held down by a sharp drop in gasoline prices, dipped 0.1 percent in November for the third decline in five months, the government said today. The drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index, which measures prices of goods one stop short of the retail level, brought the annual rate of inflation for the first 11 months of the year down to 4.6 percent, compared with 4 percent for all of 1988. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that, despite the October rise in the trade deficit, the deficit for January through October was $ 91.2 billion, `` down $ 6 billion from the trade deficit for the first 10 months of 1988.'' `` So it's still moving in the right direction,'' he said. `` We're doing exactly the right thing and now changes are necessary at this time.'' On wholesale prices, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the decline for November was `` another example that inflation is low and under control.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said industrial production edged up 0.1 percent in November as the economy rebounded from the effects of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft strike and the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay-area </LOCATION> earthquake that were largely responsible for a 0.6 percent drop a month earlier. In another report, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities edged down 0.1 percentage point to 82.7 percent in November, its lowest rate since April 1988. Many economists are looking for very little improvement in the trade imbalance in the coming year, a forecast which would spell trouble for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing sector, already suffering job losses because of weakening sales. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is likely to come under growing pressure in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to erect trade barriers in an effort to stop the flood of imports into the country. As usual, the biggest deficit in October was recorded with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an imbalance of $ 4.9 billion, almost half of the total for the month, as imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> hit a record level. Other large deficits included a $ 1.28 billion imbalance with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, an $ 843 million deficit with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and a $ 783 million deficit with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> continued to be one of the few countries with which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enjoys a trade surplus, with the October surplus totaling $ 123.2 million. The poor trade showing in October reflected import gains in a variety of areas. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foreign oil bill shot up 8.5 percent to $ 4.38 billion as the price per barrel rose 71 cents to $ 17.09 while the number of barrels imported daily held basically steady at 8.26 million. Imports of agricultural products shot up 18 percent to $ 2.24 billion while imports of industrial supplies were up 14 percent to $ 11.7 billion.

<HEAD>GATT Rules EC Soybean Subsidies Unfair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a ruling favorable to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a world trade panel has ruled that <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> subsidies to soybean processors and producers impede trade, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Friday. The soybean case, one of the main American disputes with the 12-nation European trade bloc, had been portrayed as a test of whether <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> agricultural subsidies generally violate international trade rules. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said a panel set up under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- had ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> soybean subsidies violate <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules and impede trade. `` The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> panel was correct,'' <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said. `` We look forward to the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> correcting the problems that have been identified.'' A <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman confirmed the panel had submitted a report on the dispute and said the parties had 10 days to react. Another <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> source confirmed the report, which was not released publicly, was favorable to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. American soybean producers and exporters complained in 1987 that <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> subsidies nullified or impaired concessions contained in a 1962 trade agreement. Under that pact, the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> allowed duty-free imports of soybeans and other oilseeds in exchange for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariff concessions. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has claimed that $ 1.5 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports have been affected by the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> subsidies policies. <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> officials were not immediately available for comment. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> also criticized aspects of an <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> proposal to reform agricultural trade under the latest round of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> trade talks. She said the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> proposal to `` rebalance'' its agricultural subsidies by reducing them on some products but increasing them on others `` would not prevent trade distortions, and could reinforce them.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has proposed replacing agricultural subsidies with more visible and more easily removed tariffs that gradually could be reduced under <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> has said it would accept some tariffs but oppose eliminating subsidies entirely. Hills is in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to participate in two days of talks led by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' largest trade partner, with $ 190 billion in two-way trade in 1988

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said today its 1989 earnings would be reduced by about $ 500 million because of costs from a restructuring earlier this year. The $ 500 million in net charges for the year translates to about $ 850 million before taxes, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON> said. The photography giant said $ 273 million of the reductions would be charged to fourth-quarter earnings, significantly more than had been anticipated. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> had already charged $ 227 million against earnings for the second quarter and had predicted that the fourth-quarter charge would be lower. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> in August announced a major corporate restructuring that includes between 4,500 and 5,000 job cuts _ about 3 percent of its worldwide work foce _ wage freezes, the sale or consolidation of many businesses and other cost-cutting measures `` This action reflects our efforts to sharpen the focus if the <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> organization by withdrawing from businesses and activities that do not contribute to shareowner value,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said annual earnings would be reduced because of provisions for write-offs of equipment, materials and inventories for various businesses. Additional charges will come from special payment to departing employees. `` Our business units and support organizations are clearly concentrating on value-adding operations and activities,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>'s statement read. `` As a result, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> will enter the new decade as a stronger, more competitive company.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> earnings have declined in three straight quarters. The Rochester-based company reported a 25 percent third-quarter drop to $ 329 million, or $ 1.02 per share, compared to $ 435 million, or $ 1.35 per share, in the same 1988 quarter. Earnings fell 23 percent in the first quarter and 85 percent in the second quarter compared to year-ago figures. The April-June quarter included expenses of the restructuring. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> has blamed its weakness in part on higher operating costs and no improvement in productivity, deapite strong sales. Net earnings for the first three quarters were $ 589 million, or $ 1.82 a share, down 46 percent from $ 1.09 billion, or $ 3.35 a share, in the first three quarters of 1988. The second-quarter earnings already reflected the $ 227 million in restructuring costs. Sales for the first nine months of the year rose 8 percent to $ 13.5 billion from $ 12.5 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Expensive, Aristocratic Pens May Be The Season's Hottest Gift</HEAD>

 Propelled by the strength of a single human hand, it glides with ease. Its fit feels custom-made. And it's one of the season's hottest selling items: Behold, the pen. But not just any pen. These are luxury pens, the new must-have accessory for the Rolex-watch set. Sales of fine writing instruments are skyrocketing this Christmas, with some retailers reporting increases of up to 70 percent. `` It's incredible,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON>, marketing manager for <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON> pens. `` We can sell every pen we make, and we'll double sales this year.'' Unlike fad gifts of Christmases past _ the pet rock, the Walkman, <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> perfume _ the pen is a time-honored piece. After all, <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON> used a Parker to write <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boheme </ORGANIZATION>, and it was a <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON> that scripted the end of World War I with the signing of the Treaty of <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION>. Updated to the'90s, the fancy pen is an affirmation of success. The more aristocratic in design, the better. And the price? It can be anywhere from three figures to four. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> calls the pen trend a `` cultural phenomenon'' sparked by the growing importance of `` high-quality, functional accessories.'' `` Some people say it's a rebellion against computers,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyers </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Pen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Paper in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> `` People are tired of everything being faxed and computerized. The art of letter writing is coming back again.'' A fine pen is more than a nostalgic return to personal expression. It is `` a status symbol,'' said <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON>, a pen buyer for <ORGANIZATION> Cole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which sells fine pens through its Things Remembered and HQ Gifts stores nationwide. `` Maybe the president -LRB- of a company -RRB- has one, and when he goes to a business meeting, everybody wants to have it,'' she said. Among the growing menagerie of expensive pens, <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION>, the master jeweler, is offering its `` Pasha'' fountain pen complete with 40 coats of lacquer and an 18-karat gold nib, or point, for $ 775. Then there's <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s Duofold, a $ 300 pen drilled from a solid block of acrylic, trimmed in 22-karat gold and guaranteed not to explode under airplane pressure. For those seeking something more contemporary, there's the Fendi pen, from the Italian designer of the same name, which is encased in tiny rings of pale gray rubber and sells for a measly $ 35. The year's best seller may be the Montblanc, the product of an 81-year-old West German company. Topped with a signature white `` snowcap'' reminiscent of its namesake, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest peak, <ORGANIZATION> Montblanc </ORGANIZATION> pens sell for $ 100 to $ 7,000 each. Retailers say some of <ORGANIZATION> Montblanc </ORGANIZATION>'s success comes from several years of advertising in magazines like <ORGANIZATION> Architectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>, Vanity Fair and Connoisseur. Now that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s appetite for pens has been whetted, others are riding the wave. <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON>, acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, is spending $ 5 million a year to market its French-made writing instruments. The best pens come in ball point, though they are at the lower end of the spectrum. Rollerball pens use liquid instead of paste ink, and therefore are more expensive. The most prestigious is the fountain pen. `` Although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is a ball-point society, people are finding the enjoyment of going back and writing with a fountain pen,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Koh-I-Noor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapidograph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the exclusive North American Montblanc distributor. Fountain pens are the fastest growing category of writing instruments. About 12 million were sold in 1987; a year later the number jumped to 21 million. `` If you're going to write a love letter ... does n't it look better with a fountain pen?'' <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON> asked. Because they require special care _ refilling the ink and occasional professional cleanings, fountain pens have a very special cachet. `` You have to have a bit more leisure time to deal with a fountain pen,'' said <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON>. `` Is n't that the upscale imagery being projected by the user?'' All pens must be chosen carefully. But in the case of a fountain pen, selecting a nib can take hours. Nib widths vary to produce fine to very broad scripts, and the shape of one's penmanship depends on the pressure exterted on the nib and the angle it is held against the paper. Over time, the nib conforms to an individual user, and for that reason, `` one should never lend it,'' <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> said. But despite a luxury pen's ability to elegantly paint words, how they write often is less important than how they look. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s marketing planner <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> said one businesswoman told him, `` I do n't use this pen to write with I wear it.''

 A sharp drop in gasoline costs helped push wholesale prices down in November for the third time in five months, the government said Friday in a report seen as giving the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> leeway to lower interest rates. The annual rate of inflation, as measured by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index, was 4.6 percent for the first 11 months of the year, up from 4 percent for all of 1988 but much lower than was feared earlier this year. The index dipped 0.1 percent last month following a 0.4 percent gain in October and a 0.9 percent spurt in September. It declined 0.5 percent in July and 0.4 percent in August. The roller-coaster ride averages out to an annualized inflation rate of about 1 percent from June through November, a marked contrast to the 9 percent-plus rate for the first five months of the year. `` If ever there was an example of inflation coming in like a lion and going out like a lamb, it was this year,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` That has to be good news for everyone, particularly the consumer.'' Energy prices declined 3.3 percent last month, the sharpest fall since August. A 7.7 percent drop in gasoline prices more than compensated for a 0.1 percent rise in natural gas costs and a 0.7 percent hike in heating oil prices. Analysts credit the taming of inflation to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s tight money policy pursued through this spring As evidence, they cited a separate report by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> on industrial production in November. The operating rate at the nation's factories, mines and utilities eased 0.1 percentage point to 82.7 percent, well below the 10-year high of 84.3 percent at the start of the year, the central bank said. `` Areas that were tight a year ago like chemicals, paper and metals all have excess capacity. When you have excess capacity, you see price concessions,'' said economist <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Since the summer, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has reversed course on monetary policy, hoping to avoid a recession by permitting interest rates to fall. The latest price report gives the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> leeway to cut rates another notch as early as next week, when monetary policy makers gather for the last of their eight annual meetings, economists said. A disappointing trade report for October adds impetus to the push. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the merchandise trade gap soared 19.8 percent to $ 10.2 billion, the highest level in 10 months. A drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates could help the deficit by depressing the dollar's value, stimulating exports and discouraging imports. The wholesale price report showed food costs rising a substantial 0.8 percent in November, following a 1.4 percent jump in October, the biggest in 22 months. However, they had declined overall from April through September. Pork prices jumped 7.1 percent following a 9.5 percent rise in October. Prices for turkeys and eggs also rose and dairy prices were up 3.3 percent, the fifth consecutive increase exceeding 1 percent. `` Because of the drought of ` 88, we slaughtered a lot of milk cows and we're starting to see a milk shortage as a result,'' <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> said. `` It's going to take a year to reverse that.'' The increases were partly offset by a 15.1 percent drop in vegetable costs, rebounding from an 18.9 percent rise a month earlier, and a 6.5 percent decline in fresh fruit prices. Prices for fish, chicken, coffee and rice also fell. The price of goods excluding the volatile food and energy categories _ a measure many analysts consider a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy _ rose a modest 0.2 percent last month following a 0.1 percent gain in October. Increases for a variety of goods were partly offset by a 4.8 percent decline for soaps and detergents and a 0.3 percent decrease in the passenger car index, which had fallen 1.4 percent in October. Before adjusting for normal seasonal variations, the wholesale price index stood at 114.8 in November. This meant that a hypothetical marketbasket of goods cost $ 114.80 last month compared with $ 109.80 a year earlier. The inflation news was also favorable for earlier stages in the production process. The price of intermediate goods fell 0.1 percent in November after no change a month earlier. Crude-goods prices rose 0.4 percent after holding steady in October. Excluding food and energy, crude goods prices dropped 2.3 percent. An example of the three stages would be bread for finished goods, flour for intermediate goods and wheat for crude goods.

 Wholesale prices, held down by a sharp drop in gasoline prices, dipped 0.1 percent in November for the third decline in five months, the government said today. The drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index, which measures prices of goods one stop short of the retail level, brought the annual rate of inflation for the first 11 months of the year down to 4.6 percent, compared with 4 percent for all of 1988. Wholesale inflation flared at a 9.4 percent annual rate through May, but prices since then have barely budged. The decline in November followed a 0.4 percent gain in October. Food costs, which shot up 1.4 percent in October at the fastest pace in 22 months, rose 0.8 percent last month. However, they declined overall from April through September. Pork prices jumped 7.1 percent following a 9.5 percent rise in October. Dairy prices were up 3.3 percent, the fifth consecutive increase exceeding 1 percent. Prices for processed turkeys and eggs also rose. However, that was partly offset by a 15.1 percent drop in vegetable costs and a 6.5 percent decline in fresh fruit prices. Prices for fish, chicken, coffee and rice also fell. Energy prices declined 3.3 percent, the sharpest fall since August. A 7.7 percent drop in gasoline prices more than compensated for a 0.1 percent rise in natural gas costs and a 0.7 percent hike in heating oil prices. The price of goods excluding the volatile food and energy categories _ a measure many analysts consider a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy _ rose a modest 0.2 percent last month follow a 0.1 percent gain in October. Modest increases for many kinds of consumer goods were partly offset by a 4.8 percent decline for soaps and detergents and a 0.3 percent decrease in the passenger car index, which had fallen 1.4 percent in October. Before adjusting for normal seasonal variations, the wholesale price index stood at 114.8 in November. This meant that a hypothetical marketbasket of goods cost $ 114.80 last month, up from $ 109.80 a year ago. The inflation news was also favorable for earlier stages in the production process. The price of intermediate goods fell 0.1 percent in November after no change a month earlier. Crude-goods prices rose 0.4 percent after holding steady in October. An example of the three stages would be bread for finished goods, flour for intermediate goods and wheat for crude goods. `` There has been a major deceleration in inflation in almost every measure ... that looks like it will stay in place in coming months given how weak the economy is,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In advance of today's report, many analysts were expecting a modest 0.2 percent rise in finished goods. The actual 0.1 percent decline could give a boost to financial markets that are waiting for the next cut in interest rates by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Inflation is finishing the year quietly largely because of the economic slowdown engineered months earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, analysts say. The central bank nudged interest rates higher through most of 1988 and into this spring, reversing course as the first signs of sluggishness emerged this summer. The bellwether rate charged among banks for overnight loans is averaging around 8.5 percent after peaking near 10 percent. However, the earlier tightening succeeded in slowing rate-sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and durable-goods manufacturing. That curbed demand for basic commodities such as chemicals, paper, metal and rubber and held down the prices of those items.

 Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as pre-weekend profit-taking offset buying related to the weather.

 <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, trying to rebuild profits hurt by recent takeover battles, announced Friday it would realign its operations and sell some of its European business, affecting about 750 workers in the process. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said it was creating a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shaving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> that would encompass its shaving products and toiletries segments. The reorganization would make the company more efficient, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The move is part of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy to improve its profits. In recent years, the firm has fended off takeover attempts by <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, but its earnings suffered as a result. This fall, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said it was introducing a new razor, called Sensor, which would be priced higher than the current brands but also is designed to offer a closer shave. Both the new razor and the new corporate alignment are aimed at improving the company's profits, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fausch </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` The company's strategy is to work to increase efficiency, increase profits, increase market share,'' he said. The merging of shaving and personal care will mean the elimination of about 250 jobs, <PERSON> Fausch </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> employs about 29,000 people worldwide. In addition, the company will sell its <ORGANIZATION> Antica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Erboristeria </ORGANIZATION> line of toiletries in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Toja </PERSON> bath products in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, plus European hair care products. Those operations employ about 500 people. Those products have not been as successful as the company had hoped, <PERSON> Fausch </PERSON> said. The operations to be sold represented about $ 100 million in sales last year, compared with about $ 1 billion in worldwide toiletry sales. Proceeds from the sales were expected to offset the costs from the realignment.

 As the number of days left until Christmas dwindles into single digits, catalog companies are out to persuade last-minute shoppers that they do n't have to brave crowded malls and stores. Guarantees that gifts ordered as late as the week before Christmas will arrive in time to be put under the tree are being touted by catalog companies eager to grab some of the 11th-hour business. Many gift items can be had quickly _ flannel nightgowns from <LOCATION> L.L </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Freeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, to filet mignons and elegant Beef Wellingtons from <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> Steaks International. The holiday shopping surge does n't flow smoothly between Thanksgiving and Christmas; it typically comes in two big waves at the beginning and the end with a long lull in between. `` We are in the crucial final sprint right now,'' said retail analyst <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc The second wave _ which can make or break the season _ has been a washout for some catalog companies in Christmases past because customers would n't take the risk of being empty-handed on the big day. This year, industry officials guess that possibly more than 150 catalogs are bearing promises that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> or other rapid delivery services will speed presents on their way. Some that offered fast delivery in the past have introduced new extras. Sportswear and outdoor gear cataloger Lands' <ORGANIZATION> End </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Dodgeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, says anything it has in stock can be shipped via <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> to someone's home within two days and the customer can designate the day. A customer who works a standard Monday through Friday week might prefer Saturday delivery, for instance. The cost is $ 6 per address, regardless of the size of the order. Most catalogs boasting fast service require customers to pay a bit more, starting at around $ 4. The charges, which range as high as $ 17.00 an order, could turn off some potential shoppers. But catalogers say they've tried to keep them as low as possible to appeal to procrastinators willing to pay to be spared some aggravation. <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which also owns <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> and Honeybee, mailed reminders of its pre-Christmas UPS delivery guarantee to hundreds of thousands of its five million active customers. The guarantee is good for orders placed by Dec. 21, provided the item still is available. It also publicized its holiday program by placing inserts in newspapers around the country and in <LOCATION> Vogue </LOCATION> and GQ magazines. Research done by the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Blunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loewi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> estimated last year's total catalog sales at $ 12 billion. About one-third of all American households bought goods through more than 900 catalogs, <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> says. Sales through catalogs, which some analysts say have been growing at about twice the pace of store sales in recent years, have expanded to meet the demands of two-income families in which neither parent or spouse has much time to shop. The <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says that this year 51.4 percent of the adult <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population has ordered at least once by telephone or mail, up from 24.5 percent in 1983, the first year the figures were compiled. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Longendyke </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said express delivery services have made catalogs a more viable method of shopping for people in a hurry, especially ahead of Christmas. `` Before you had to be one of those prudent people that got down to it early,'' he said. `` The great thing now is you can procrastinate without having to go into the stores when they're at their busiest.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced an incentive program Friday designed in part to maintain production at its two minivan plants before shutting them down to retool for a new version. The program includes a guarantee that the company will make up any difference in rebate programs through the first three quarters of next year _ a time <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has said will include some of the toughest months in recent automotive history. The guarantee is aimed at consumers who may be waiting for more attractive incentives later in the year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON> said Friday at a news conference. `` We want some -LRB- showroom -RRB- traffic now,'' <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON> said. Sales Manager <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Keensport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chrysler-Plymouth </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said his dealership could use some traffic. `` It's real slow this month,'' he said Friday. `` At this time of year, it's hard to compete with <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>.'' Typically, vehicle sales pick up a little in January and fall off again in February before rebounding in March and April as weather improves. In the past, when one of the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers issued a new incentive program, the other two soon followed. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate reaction to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s move <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s new incentives range from $ 500 to $ 2,000, depending on model, or low-interest financing ranging from 6.9 percent to 9.9 percent, depending on length of loan. Some minivans have an option of cash rebates or interest rates as low as 3.9 percent on a 2-year loan. The program, which expires Jan. 31, 1990, covers two-thirds of the cars and light trucks <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> makes. The incentives on <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s minivans represent the first time in six years that an enticement has been offered on the popular vehicles. Since their introduction, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has commanded more than 50 percent of the minivan market. But that share is being eroded by recent introductions of new minivans from <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and those already in showrooms from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and a half-dozen or so Japanese companies. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> expects to introduce a new version of its <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caravan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> next fall for the 1991 model year. Production at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s minivan plants in <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, will be shut down in the third week of June and the third week of July, respectively, to change equipment for the new models. The changeovers will take about four weeks, <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON> said. Analysts have speculated that automakers, faced with swelling inventories and waning demand, may cut their supplies of unsold cars by curtailing production during the first quarter of 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said this week that it would shut down its car plant near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, causing about 3,400 layoffs, for four weeks beginning Monday because of slow sales of the Chrysler LeBaron and the <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION>. The company also said 3,000 employees of its <LOCATION> Belvidere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, plant, which makes five full-size cars, would be laid off for two weeks beginning Jan. 2 because of falling sales. <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON> said that wo n't be the case for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s minivan plants, which make a product that's responsible for much of the company's shrinking profits. `` We absolutely do not face downtime except for the changeover,'' <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON> said. However, he added, some overtime at the two plants may be cut. Analysts and industry officials have agreed that demand for minivans will remain strong during next year while the industry as a whole weakens. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has forecast that 14.2 million cars and light trucks will be sold in 1990, down from the 14.8 million or so that will be sold this year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has forecast a slightly slower year in 1990 while <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has forecast the industry will sell 15 million vehicles.

 <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> lawyers alleged Friday that government witnesses lied in testimony during the company's lengthy stock fraud trial and said <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> rejected a last-minute offer that would have cleared him of criminal charges. Only hours after the government offered the deal Wednesday, a federal jury convicted <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> on all eight counts of stock manipulation, securities fraud and other charges in an alleged 1986 scheme to boost <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price. Under the deal, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> would have pleaded guilty to all counts and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> would have been released of all charges in the deal, according to lawyers involved in the case. The company reportedly had approved the deal. But as part of the deal, <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> would have had to sign a statement saying he was acting on behalf of the company in the unlawful activities alleged by the government. Lawyers for <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> plan to appeal the verdict. The <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> verdict, which was viewed as a major victory for the government, came after two mistrials earlier this year. Lead <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> in a statement said <ORGANIZATION> WATS </ORGANIZATION> line telephone records from the <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> brokerage, which allegedly conducted the manipulation for <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, refuted testimony that calls were made to <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> to discuss the October 1986 scheme. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> -RRB- is a man of principle who sat through three trials that were tainted by brazen perjury that was finally exposed by the WATS records,'' <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> said in a statement. `` We were under no illusions as to the likely verdict. It was visible on the jurors' faces `` But the government insisted on a corporate allocution which would have stripped <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> of all self respect and condoned the perjury. This he could not let the corporation do and he has no regrets about the decision he made to allow the jury deliberations to proceed to verdict.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> declined to comment on the perjury allegation. The government based its case on testimony by admitted felon and former stockbroker <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who testified that he agreed to bid up the price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>'s request. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> was seeking to sell 5 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> after a failed takeover bid. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> promised to reimburse the brokerage for any losses. Evidence included an allegedly phony invoice for $ 40,000 investment banking advisory services that represented a trading loss. <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> chief trader <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and trading assistant <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> testified about the alleged phone calls. <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> claimed he called <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> at the end of three consecutive trading days to discuss the upward manipulation of Carbide stock. The WATS line records indicated no such calls were made. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said she overheard the calls. Records for regular phone lines also did not indicate that the calls were made. Also, <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>' testimony was contradicted during the second trial and <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> in his closing arguments said <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>' testimony was `` filled with inconsistencies and contradictions.'' <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> faces up to 40 years in prison and up to $ 2 million in fines, but his sentence is expected to be far less than the maximum. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> could be fined up to $ 4 million.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Media giant <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it expects to post higher earnings this year and that savings from its recently-enacted newspaper joint operating agreement in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> will boost 1990 earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said it expects a profit increase for 1989 but said earnings growth would be more difficult to achieve in 1990 due to impending labor negotiations, slow advertising revenue growth and weak newsprint prices. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said a gain on the sale of its cable operations would mean record 1989 earnings, but earnings from continuing operations _ excluding the cable sale gain _ would be down substantially. It expects higher earnings in 1990 excluding the cable sale gain. The companies discussed their earnings prospects before securities analysts attending the annual <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> media outlook conference. Advertising revenue growth from Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s 29 daily newspapers, lower newsprint prices and lower interest costs were cited for contributing to the company's stronger 1989 earnings outlook. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive, declined to offer a specific projection of earnings. But securities analysts have estimated 1989 earnings per share from continuing operations will amount to between $ 2.80 and $ 2.90 compared with net income of $ 2.59 a share in 1988 and 1990 earnings per share from continuing operations of $ 3.40 to $ 3.50. <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said one major contributor to earnings growth in 1990 would be the recent enactment of the joint operating agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc He said the agreement, which combined business operations of the newspapers while news and editorial staffs operate separately, means an end to 11 consecutive years of operating losses at the Free Press. <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said the Free Press was expected to lose between $ 13 million and $ 16 million in 1989, excluding corporate charges but that the company `` wo n't lose money in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> next year.'' <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said the end of losses at the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> newspaper, contiunued soft newsprint prices, improvement at The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and strong results from business information services will help 1990 earnings. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said strong growth in its broadcasting and entertainment businesses as well as increases from newspapers should help it post earnings per share of $ 3.10 in 1989, up from $ 2.78 in 1988. But <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, senior vice president and chief financial officer, although the company would like higher earnings per share in 1990, `` this may be a difficult goal to achieve.'' He said the company faces `` difficult labor negotiations'' involving workers at the Daily News in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said contract talks also will occur next year involving newsprint production workers in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and major league players. <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> owns the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> baseball team. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said newspaper ad revenues were up 4.5 percent to 5 percent in 1989 and should be slightly higher in 1990. But he said weakness in newsprint prices may persist, hurting <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>'s results from newsprint operations. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 2.08 a share in 1988 and posted a gain of $ 2.46 per share this year on the sale of its cable system. It announced earlier this week it intended to charge 57 cents a share against fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting estimated costs of voluntary staff cuts at its flagship newspaper due to a weak advertising climate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, further automation of production facilities and a decline in its valuations of its investment in forest products operations. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer, said a 7 percent decline in ad linage at the Times offset the effects of tighter cost controls. That combined with lower newsprint prices in 1989 will produce flat operating results from newspapers, excluding special charges taken in 1988. He said results from magazines would decline from 1988, showing a loss for the year due to acquisitions, but that broadcast and information services were up and regional newspapers had a record year. Newsprint business results also are down sharply, he said. <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON> said with the charges, the company lost money in the fourth quarter and that earnings from continuing operations `` will be down substantially for the year.'' Including the cable gain, however, the company will have record earnings for the year. He said he agreed with analysts who have predicted `` another year of low earnings'' in 1990 but said earnings should top 1989 results, excluding the cable sale.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will buy half of <ORGANIZATION> Saab-Scania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION>'s troubled car business for about $ 600 million, in a deal analysts described Friday as a good one for both companies. The analysts' endorsement of the association is far different from the concern some voiced seven weeks ago when <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced it would buy all of British automaker <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.5 billion. `` <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> paid about $ 3,000 per unit and <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> went for about $ 40,000 per unit,'' said analyst <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the ratio of investment price and the sales of <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> cars. `` One way to look at the $ 600 million is that's how much it takes to build a new car,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> will form a new independent Swedish car company called <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> which will produce cars under the <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> name for worldwide distribution and some <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> models for the European market. In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Saab-Scania </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnsund </PERSON> said in a statement that times are tough for low-volume automakers. <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>'s car operations lost $ 186.1 million during the first eight months of this year `` Soaring costs for research and development and ever-increasing international competition make it difficult for small-volume makers to survive on their own in a longer perspective,'' he said. `` For <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>,'' said analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, `` I think there are some definite benefits.

Under their agreement, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> will invest $ 100 million in the new venture. Each company will nominate five members of the 10-member board, and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> will nominate the chairman.

I think they must have disagreed on price,'' <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> officials would n't discuss whether others have made overtures, <PERSON> Sortwell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> has argued that combining with Coors would increase competition by creating an effective No. 3 competitor to go against <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, the leader with 41 percent of the market, and No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has 21 percent. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> now is No. 3 with an 11 percent market share and <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> is No. 4 with just under 8 percent, followed by <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heileman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> with about 7 percent. `` Although we continue to believe that consolidation in the brewing industry would be good for long-term competition, we are taking aggressive steps to strengthen our ability to compete independently,'' <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> said. Preparations for possible independent operation included recent employment cuts and sales of <LOCATION> Stroh </LOCATION> assets, <PERSON> Sortwell </PERSON> said. `` As of right now, it would appear to be somewhat likely,'' he said. On Thursday, the 139-year-old <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> company said it had agreed to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Sundance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sparkler </ORGANIZATION> business for $ 58 million to a partnership in which <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> each would hold a 44 percent interest. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> has sought potential partners since February and announced Aug. 31 it was laying off 300 of its 1,500 white-collar employees nationwide because there had been no suitable offers. Members of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in November to prohibit the Coors-Stroh transaction as anti-competitive. The department's antitrust division was reviewing the deal. Also pending is a federal lawsuit by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, company that owns several smaller breweries, including <ORGANIZATION> Pabst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ribbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamms </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Falstaff </PERSON> and commands a 4 percent market share. The suit contends the combination would overwhelmingly increase the market share of the nation's four largest brewers.

 A regional real estate slump prompted <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to announce Friday it will sharply boost reserves against bad loans and that it expects a substantial loss for the year. The bank also announced it had reassigned a senior executive overseeing its real estate group, that it was considering the sale and merger of some operations and that it may rescind its common stock dividend declared Nov. 27. `` In my history of following bank stocks, that action is unprecedented,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, referring to the stock move. `` I think what it tells you is the deterioration of the real estate market is getting faster. It goes from bad to worse every day.'' `` It may be in the best interest of the company to preserve its capital, even at the expense of shareholders,'' he said. <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the bank, said a dividend of 34 cents a share had been declared for the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31. `` What we're saying is we're looking at a very large addition to our reserves and that is going to change the -LRB- dividend -RRB- calculations,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, which had a loan loss reserve of $ 354 million at the end of the third quarter, said it would boost that total to more than $ 1 billion in the current quarter. The company already had taken provisions for problem loans totaling about $ 207.3 million in the nine months ended Sept. 30. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> stock tumbled $ 3.37 -LCB- to $ 9 a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Friday. The company, owner of the region's second-largest bank, indicated in late November that it expected a substantial loss for the fourth quarter due to the sluggish area economy and a soft real estate market. At that time, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> announced the sale of a major portion of its leasing operations to the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> as part of a strategic restructuring. The latest move follows similar steps taken by other financial institutions. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, the largest bank in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, reported a $ 125 million loss in its third quarter after setting aside money to cover problem loans. Much of the trouble stems from the region's real estate market, which boomed during the middle 1980s but now has gone sour. As a result, banks have found many developers are having trouble making loan payments. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> issued a statement saying the additional money placed in reserves was appropriate to the quality of the bank's loan portfolio and existing economic conditions in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Non-performing assets are expected to increase to $ 1.6 billion, but the company said it projects its capital ratios will exceed regulatory minimums. <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> also said the bank's senior management, along with a special committee of the board of directors, was addressing the company's loans and assets. Executive Vice President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, who had been head of the real estate group, has been removed from that position and assigned to other duties in the company. `` The finger has to point at someone,'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said. `` These problems are real estate related. Some changes had to be made.'' The bank announced that Executive Vice President <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, head of the corporate banking group, will take over the real estate division until a permanent head is selected. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> also announced the special committee and management will look at steps to increase shareholder values, including possible mergers and sales of assets. The company posted a profit of $ 121.6 million in the nine months ended Sept. 30, down from $ 207.7 million in the same period a year earlier.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower In Thin Trading</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede: BC-LONDON</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar finished mostly lower Friday in dealings that remained thin despite the release of key economic data. Gold prices gained more than $ 5 an ounce, mostly on speculative buying. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery rose $ 5.60 a troy ounce to settle at $ 413.90. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> quoted a late bid for gold even higher at $ 414.50 an ounce, up $ 6.20 from Thursday's late bid. The government's latest reports on the economy proved bearish for the dollar. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened to $ 10.2 billion in October, greater than the $ 9 billion traders had expected. A large deficit makes a case for a lower dollar, which helps improve the trade gap by making imports more expensive and exports cheaper. Separately, the government said producer prices slipped 0.1 percent in November, bucking predictions that called for a 0.1 percent gain. After the figures were released, `` the dollar came off fairly substantially,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrissey </PERSON>, senior trader at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. The dollar fell below the critical 1.7210 level against the West German mark, leading traders to believe the currency is gathering momentum to move lower. News of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> declaring that a `` state of war'' exists with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helped the dollar strengthen a bit and gave gold prices a boost. But another mild tremor shook the currency market late in the session when the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was briefly down 45 points. The dollar finished at lower levels in sparse trading. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 0.23 Japanese yen to a closing 144.30 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 144.10 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar closed at 144.15 yen, unchanged from late Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.6055 from $ 1.5970 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> one pound cost $ 1.6030, more expensive than Thursday's $ 1.6010. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.7190 West German marks, down from 1.7344; 1.5480 Swiss francs, down from 1.5630; 5.8785 French francs, down from 5.9285; 1,283.50 Italian lire, down from 1,292.50, and 1.1608 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1598. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.7225 West German marks, down from 1.7375; 1.5485 Swiss francs, down from 1.5630; 5.8885 French francs, down from 5.9420; 1.9480 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9565; 1,286.50 Italian lire, down from 1,295.75, and 1.1606 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1585. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 412.25 a troy ounce from $ 407.50 bid late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the metal rose to a closing bid of $ 412.50 from $ 408.50 bid late Thursday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 65 cents to close at a bid $ 409.30. Silver rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 5.62 a troy ounce from $ 5.58 bid late Thursday. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery finished at $ 5.607 an ounce, up from Thursday's $ 5.557.

 A midsession selloff drove stock prices lower Friday amid worries about real-estate finance and the outlook for the economy in early 1990. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 14.08 to 2,739.55, reducing its gain for the week to 8.11 points. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 619 up, 924 down and 470 unchanged. Analysts said a gradual early decline in prices picked up speed after stories crossed financial news wires that Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been named chief of government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and was moving to confront a `` state of war'' arising from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies. Brokers also cited pressure on financial stocks after the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> announced projected increases in its loan-loss reserve and non-performing assets, and said it would report a substantial loss for the year. Analysts said that development exacerbated recent worries about the real estate market in many parts of the country and the problems real-estate debt might pose should prices of properties lag for an extended period. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> shares led the active list, down 3 -RRB- at 9 on volume of more than 4.64 million shares. Among other regional banking issues, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> lost 1 | to 17 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Shawmut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> 1 -LRB- to 19 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Citytrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> 1 -RRB- to 17 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> 1 to 23, and Southeast Banking 1 -RRB- to 20 Federal National Mortgage, a market standout for most of 1989 until real estate-finance worries began to mount, dropped -RCB- to 33 -RCB- in active trading. Among the blue-chip industrials, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> fell -RRB- to 42 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> 1 to 42 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> -LCB- to 33 \, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to 41 -LRB- Stocks were buffeted around a bit by orders from professional traders engaged in computer-program strategies involving individual stocks and a series of expiring options and futures on stock indexes. But the so-called triple witching hour, which comes on the third Friday of the last month of each calendar quarter, actually appeared to help the market cut its losses in late trading. At its midafternoon low, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average showed a drop of more than 43 points. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 240.39 million shares, up from 178.70 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 273.67 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 10.16 billion, or 0.30 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped .52 to 193.45. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index slipped .65 to 399.91, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down .79 at 350.14. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell 3.64 to 443.84. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 375.50, down 1.32.

 A blast of frigid air pushed heating oil futures prices to a four-year high Friday, while crude oil futures surged on reports of new political moves in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the January contract for No. 2 heating oil jumped 3.14 cents to 70.42 cents a gallon in active trading. Domestic heating oil last closed higher on Jan. 10, 1986, when it hit 72.53 cents a gallon, according to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, statistical analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>. The contract closed out the week with a gain of 4.05 cents from its 66.37-cent finish last Friday. West Texas Intermediate, the main grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, jumped 45 cents to end at $ 21.15 per 42-gallon barrel. It was the highest level since April 26, when the near-term crude contract closed at $ 21.19 a barrel. `` Today, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was definitely the major factor in the crude market,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, energy analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for January ended the session at 52.80 cents a gallon, a gain of 1.19 cents on the session and 0.65 cent for the week Sub-freezing temperatures throughout much of the nation have boosted demand for heating oil in recent days and spurred buying in crude and gasoline markets, analysts said. Logistical problems in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> due to the low water level of the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> also contributed to the demand spurt. `` The River Rhine rose a foot this week, but the situation still had a moderating impact on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets this week,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rubber-stamp legislature Friday named him chief executive of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and gave him sweeping powers to confront <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to oust the combative general. <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION>'s Steel said events in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> prompted concerns about the possible closure of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and disruption of oil shipments. `` A lot of oil goes from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> through the canal to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<HEAD>Puts 1989 Restructuring Costs at $500 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that costs related to a restructuring announced this year would reduce fourth quarter earnings by $ 273 million, significantly more than the company had predicted. The $ 273 million charge brings <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s total 1989 restructuring costs to $ 500 million, or $ 850 million before taxes, spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON> said. The photography giant had charged $ 227 million against its second quarter earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> had estimated earlier this year that fourth quarter charges would be lower than those in the second quarter. `` Charges have evolved as plans have finalized,'' <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON> said. `` It's the difference between predictions and actual experience.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> has now accounted for all charges associated with the restructuring, <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON> said. `` Charges in 1990 should be only those that occur in the normal course of our ongoing operations,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> announced a restructuring plan in August designed to save the company $ 1 billion in costs and turn around its sagging profits. The plan includes selling or reorganizing about 20 businesses and cutting more than 4,500 jobs _ about 3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide workforce _ as well as freezing wages and other cost-cutting measures. `` This action reflects our efforts to sharpen the focus of the <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> organization by withdrawing from businesses and activities that do not contribute to shareowner value,'' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. `` Our business units and support organizations are clearly concentrating on value-adding operations and activities,'' he said. `` As a result, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> will enter the new decade as a stronger, more competitive company.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> earnings have declined in three straight quarters. The Rochester-based company has blamed its poor showing on higher operating costs and no improvement in productivity, as well as competition from abroad. Earnings dropped 25 percent in the third quarter to $ 329 million, or $ 1.02 a share, vs. $ 435 million or $ 1.35 per share in the same 1988 quarter. Earnings fell 23 percent in the first quarter and 85 percent in the second quarter, when the first restructuring charges were recognized. Net earnings for the first three quarters were $ 589 million, or $ 1.82 a share, down 46 percent from $ 1.09 billion, or $ 3.35 per share, in the first three quarters of 1988. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obenzinger </PERSON>, a stock analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, predicted that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> would do no better than break even in the fourth quarter of 1989. Earnings in 1990 will improve simply because there will be no more charges, he said, but <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> will face a number of challenges to improving profits in the first half of the year. Among those challenges is the expected ruling on how much <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> will have to pay <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> for violating its instant camera patent _ predicted to be in the $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion range. The company also faces fierce foreign competition and a weak economy, <PERSON> Obenzinger </PERSON> said. `` As you go into the first quarter of 1990 it's going to be a fairly interesting time,'' he said. `` This addresses the ills of the past but does not guarantee them the future.'' <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON> said slightly more than a third of the $ 500 million charge reflects inventory writeoffs from the businesses <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is exiting. Other costs include writeoffs of equipment and goodwill costs _ the amount a company pays for an asset in excess of its value, and benefits paid to departing employees, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> has so far announced the sale of 10 businesses, and <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON> said the company hopes to have the sale of at least 10 more completed in the next two weeks.

 Two former executives of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> division pleaded guilty Friday to obtaining inside information from a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official about a defense contract competition. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapinac </PERSON>, 54, a former senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> division, and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. `` Jack'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 48, a former <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> marketing executive, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government. They agreed to cooperate with the long-running investigation of procurement fraud and influence peddling, nicknamed `` Operation Ill Wind,'' that has netted convictions of 29 individuals and four corporations. `` While I offer no excuses for my actions, I do believe the defense acquisition process is conducive to abuses,'' <PERSON> Rapinac </PERSON> said. Rapinac and <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> each could face up to five years in prison and fines up to $ 250,000 when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> sentences them March 9. They admitted paying $ 27,500 to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> defense consultant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> for inside information on the award of a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> contract to build a radar command and control system worth up to $ 150 million. With the help of another defense consultant, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> obtained information about the confidential selection process being conducted by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, according to court papers filed by the prosecution Friday. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> got the information from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, then a senior procurement official at the naval command, and gave it to <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> to be relayed to <LOCATION> Rapinac </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, according to the statement of facts filed by prosecutors in the case. <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> provided information about how various <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement boards ranked the proposals of competing defense companies and told <ORGANIZATION> Rapinac </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> what other companies were bidding, advising <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> to lower its bid to $ 95 million, prosecutors said. Neither Stone nor <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> has been charged. <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>, 59, was convicted Thursday for participating in a scheme by a <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary to funnel bribes to a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> contracting official. He faces a possible 70-year prison sentence on that conviction. Prosecutors describe <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> as a major figure in the Pentagon procurement scandal. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> abruptly withdrew from the competition in June, 1988, when the `` Ill Wind'' investigation became public, prosecutors said. In a letter to employees, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniell </PERSON> said the actions of the former <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> executives `` were wrong and violated clear company policies.'' `` This unfortunate occurrence compels me to remind all employees we are committed to upholding the law and maintaining the highest standards of ethical conduct,'' <PERSON> Daniell </PERSON> said. Company spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> is cooperating with the investigation. Court papers said that <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>'s president, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> approved the consulting agreement with <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said that approval of all consulting agreements by the president was standard procedure and <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> did not authorize `` illegally obtaining government information.'' Stone's attorney, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gettings </PERSON>, called the allegations against his client `` a lot of hearsay.'' Also Friday, <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> sentenced two former executives of a <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary for participating in a scheme to bribe a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> procurement officer. Both pleaded guilty to bribery charges. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON>, 59, a former vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, received a 10-month sentence $ 10,000 fine for his involvement in a scheme to funnel more than $ 80,000 to the procurement official. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassel </PERSON>, 53, who headed the company's <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, operation, was ordered to serve three months in a halfway house and fined $ 3,000 The bribes were funneled to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> through <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> and two other defense consultants. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> is serving an 18-month prison term for participating in another bribery scheme.

<HEAD>Panama News Helps Boost Gold, Oil Futures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s latest declaration of hostility against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent gold prices up sharply Friday and contributed to a dramatic rise in energy prices by sparking fears of a disruption in shipments through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. On other commodity markets, livestock and meat futures advanced and grains and soybeans were mixed. Gold futures settled $ 5.50 to $ 5.60 higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in December up $ 5.60 at $ 413.90 a troy ounce Silver finished 4.7 cents to 5.7 cents higher with December at $ 5.607 a troy ounce. Gold initially drew strength from news that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened to $ 10.2 billion in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report prompted a weakening of the dollar against other major currencies, which is frequently a buy signal for gold. News of the passage of a resolution by the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>'s assembly of a resolution stating that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is in a `` state of war while the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- agression lasts'' reached the gold market late in the session and triggered fresh buying The rally reflected investor flight to the perceived safety of gold and other precious metals, which is typical during periods of heightened international tensions. `` I think the markets at the moment are in somewhat of a bullish trend and susceptible to bullish moves on any news of this nature that comes out,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Orton </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Deak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based dealer of precious metals and currencies. The gold runup also was a response to a sharp drop in stock prices in the middle of the afternoon, reminding observers that a stock-market dive on Oct. 13 had marked the starting point of gold's recent surge from levels near $ 360 an ounce. Spot gold has been trading within a range between $ 400 and $ 420 for more than a week but analysts said the market's pronounced behavior on Friday indicated underlying bullishness. `` Even if it goes down to $ 390, the trend remains up,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON>, senior metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The dollar's weak and I think that will be a long-term bullish backdrop for gold.'' Heating-oil futures surged mightily on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market's 12th rise in the last 13 sessions, in anticipation of bone-chilling cold weather in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sub-zero </LOCATION> temperatures were recorded Friday in the nation's mid-section, and the cold front was expected to invade the populous <LOCATION> Northeastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the weekend The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> news was supportive but represented only `` a blip of maybe 30 points'' in heating oil's 314-point gain, said analyst <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. However, the possibility of oil supply disruptions through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> helped boost crude oil prices, analysts said. Heating oil settled 1.04 cents to 3.14 cents higher with January at 70.42 cents a gallon; West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 10 cents to 45 cents higher with January at $ 21.10 a barrel; unleaded gasoline was .96 cent to 1.19 cents higher with January at 52.80 cents a gallon. Cold weather has slowed livestock marketings and continued to support livestock and meat futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle finished .02 cent lower to .52 cent higher with December at 77.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .55 cent higher with January at 84.27 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .20 cent higher with December at 52.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to 1.10 cents higher with February at 51.42 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as pre-weekend profit-taking offset weather-related buying. Wheat futures settled 1 -LCB- cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 4.13 a bushel; corn futures were -RCB- cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at $ 2.35 -RCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent to -LCB- cent lower with December at $ 1.43 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 -RCB- cents lower to 1 cent higher with January at $ 5.83 \ a bushel

 <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Belatti </PERSON> was named president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Friday in a move hailed by a group of dissident franchisees as a step toward ending their feud with the fast-food chain's parent <PERSON> Belatti </PERSON> was the chain's executive vice president for marketing and has in the past been critical of industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, who controls <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. Particularly, <PERSON> Belatti </PERSON> opposed a plan to move <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, however, praised <PERSON> Belatti </PERSON> on Friday as a company man who would maintain <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s growth. <PERSON> Belatti </PERSON> was recommended by <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Darling </PERSON>, a former president of <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> who had been retained as a consultant in <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION>'s search for a new <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s president. The possibility of moving the headquarters out of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has been among major points of contention in a quarrel that has been raging since the summer between <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> and many of the chain's franchisees <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mottram </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION>, said that <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> still plans to move <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> by 1991. The franchisee group, headed by former <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s President <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, sought to buy <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, a move resisted by <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. The group charged that a variety of legal and financial problems faced by <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> was threatening the stability of the chain, which specializes in roast beef sandwiches. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said Friday that <PERSON> Belatti </PERSON>'s appointment signaled an apparent end to the friction within the company. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said he was stepping down as president of A.P. Association, an organization of franchisees representing about 75 percent of the chain's 2,150 restaurants. But he took a parting shot at <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. `` I hope the stability achieved this week by the Arby's system is permanent,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` But I urge you to be mindful of what has happened to other companies that <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> has controlled. `` And if instability returns, I urge you to recall the values of unity and mobilization. They do get results,'' he said. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who was popular with the chain's franchisees, was ousted from <PERSON> Arby </PERSON>'s in September after he clashed with <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> over the $ 200 million takeover bid. The two had been in a verbal war ever since, with <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> at one point accusing <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of waging a misinformation campaign with `` ugly press releases.'' <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> acquired <PERSON> Arby </PERSON>'s in 1984 as part of <ORGANIZATION> Chesapeake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 400 purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION> owns 60 percent of <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> The fast-food chain had total revenues of $ 153.8 million last year and operating profit of $ 20.7 million.

<HEAD>Court Stalls Warner's Bankruptcy Settlement Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court Friday froze the distribution of funds in financier <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>'s $ 16 million personal bankruptcy settlement to allow more time to consider a government appeal. The former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> financier won approval of the plan from a federal bankruptcy judge in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Dec. 4, following two years of legal wrangling. But the major creditor, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, filed an immediate appeal. The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> ruled to hold off on paying creditors indefinitely while it considers the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> arguments that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s assets could be gone before it gets paid. Under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is to receive a total of $ 13 million in six annual installments. If the appeals court had not made some kind of ruling by Friday, the plan would have gone into effect. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, 70, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> whose fortune crumbled after his <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> collapsed, said he did not have an immediate comment on the ruling. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> lives on an <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, horse ranch. `` I believe ultimately the plan will be confirmed,'' said court-appointed bankruptcy trustee <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowrey </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>. `` As it stands now, no payment has been made to anybody yet.'' The bankruptcy plan also included $ 3.6 million in fees to attorneys and accountants who spent thousands of hours analyzing <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s financial transactions since <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s 1985 collapse. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from creditors in October 1987 under federal bankruptcy law to halt $ 4 billion in claims against him. A jury in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> found <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> guilty in March 1987 on charges resulting from Home State's collapse. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was sentenced to 3 -LCB- years in prison, but a state appellate court recently rejected the convictions. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> prosecutors plan to ask the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate the convictions.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which lost more than $ 100 million in the first nine months of the year, announced Friday it is in technical default of $ 309 million in loans.

 <ORGANIZATION> Winnebago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> ended its experiment in management by committee on Friday, naming <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> president and chief executive of the company that makes recreational vehicles and trucks and offers satellite delivery of television commercials. <PERSON> Winnebago </PERSON>, which is trying to recover from a series of losses, also announced other executive appointments, replacing the 10-person management council that had governed the <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> company since September 1988. <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said his task would be `` downsizing'' Winnebago to make it more efficient, so it could better ride out swings in gasoline prices and the economy _ two major factors that influence sales of motor homes. He said no layoffs are planned but that the company might reduce its payroll by not filling all vacancies created by workers leaving or retiring. Efficiencies mostly would come by being more careful with inventories and getting rid of excess raw material. `` We've got a lot of work to do,'' he said in a telephone interview. The appointments were announced by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Winnebago </PERSON>'s founder and chairman, a day after a vote on the changes by the company's board of directors The announcement also followed by a day the company's report of a $ 4.6 million loss and a 38 percent slide in revenue in the first quarter of its fiscal year compared with the same period a year earlier. The loss followed a fourth-quarter sea of red ink, an $ 11.3 million loss that was the largest of any quarter in the company's history. <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said that in addition to strengthening the management team and moving to control expenses, <PERSON> Winnebago </PERSON> also will try to turn things around by doing a better job designing and selling its products. The company is financially strong because of its low debt, but <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said, `` the strongest thing is the reputation and name. <PERSON> Winnebago </PERSON> seems to stand for quality and we're going to live up to that.'' <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, 57, has been a member of the company's board since 1985 and was chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Winnebago </ORGANIZATION>'s Cycle Sat subsidiary since August. Cycle Sat delivers commercials to television stations by satellites. The election of <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> as president was no surprise. He was marked for advancement in August when he was elected deputy chairman of the board to replace <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, the founder's son, who resigned as a director and officer of the company. `` I understand he -LRB- <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> -RRB- gets along with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, which is a necessary in the job,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolfes </PERSON>, an analyst who follows Winnebago for the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> securities firm of <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rolfes </PERSON> said the appointment would help improve <PERSON> Winnebago </PERSON>'s image because `` I do n't think anybody likes to see a company run by a committee.'' Winnebago stock closed down 25 cents at $ 5.25 a share in trading Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The announcement of the new management team came at the end of the trading day.

<HEAD>Bonds Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices were mostly lower Friday as traders had little response to government data giving further mixed signals on the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond fell 1-32 point, or less than $ 1 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield was unchanged from late Thursday at 7.85 percent. Analysts said the credit markets shrugged off a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that the nation's merchandise trade deficit soared to $ 10.2 billion in October, a 19.8 percent jump from September's $ 8.51 billion imbalance. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index dipped 0.1 percent last month following a 0.4 percent gain in October and a 0.9 percent rise in September. Analysts said the producer-price index figure was better than expected while the trade deficit growth was worse. The reports negated each other in impact on the credit markets. `` The general gist of all the evidence we've had over the entire week is that we have a pretty sluggish situation in the conomy,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` But there was nothing either great or harmful to get things moving,'' she said. `` The market is very quiet. There are n't that many positions in the Street now.'' Bondholders have welcomed recent news of a slowing economy because it implies less demand for goods and services, easing the risk of inflation, which erodes the value of bonds. Slower growth also encourages the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to take steps that would lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. Lower rates make fixed-income investments such as bonds more valuable. Economists said they believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could ease interest rates next week. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, prices of short-term issues were down 1-32 point to 1-16 point, intermediate-term maturities were 1-16 point to 3-32 point lower, and long-term issues were unchanged to down 1-32 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, was down 0.34 at 1,195.65. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 7.88 percent as the discount gained 2 basis points to 7.64 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 7.78 percent while the discount rose 1 basis point to 7.40 percent. Yields on one-year bills issued at auction Thursday were at 7.63 percent with the discount off 1 basis points to 7.13 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 8 -LCB- percent, down from 87-16 percent late Thursday. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 93 23-32, up 1-32 point. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 7.24 percent.

 The brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay a $ 100,000 fine and be censured for stock pricing violations following the 1987 market crash, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. In addition, <PERSON> Prudential-Bache </PERSON> `` made adjustments'' of $ 235,901.50 in the prices customers paid in connection with the questioned transactions, the association said in a statement. In settling the matter, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> neither admitted nor denied the allegations, the statement said. The association's market surveillance committee said <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> received sell orders involving 20 securities for which it was the market maker on Oct. 19, 1987, but failed to complete the sales while the market was open. It said the firm subsequently bought the securities from the customers at prices that were at least 8 percent below the lowest reported price of the day. As a result, the committee said the 186 customer accounts placing the sell orders received $ 235,901.50 less than what they would have received had the orders been executed at the lowest price of the day. The allegations involve activities on Black Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average plunged 508 points in its biggest one-day loss ever. <PERSON> Prudential-Bache </PERSON> was unable to execute the trades until after the close of the market because of the extraordinary market conditions. But the association said that the firm had access before it made the deals to information that indicated the intra-day trading range for these securities. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> is a self-regulatory organization for the over-the-counter markets. Its surveillance committee is responsible for maintaining the integrity of those markets.

<HEAD>Phoenix Corporation Announces Loss, New Debt Agreement</HEAD>

 Debt-ridden <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday reported that it has arranged short-term debt relief in an attempt to get ahead of its interest payments. Company spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said the new agreement was made possible when a syndicate of banks waived compliance with the required-profit-level covenants covering Circle K's $ 325 million credit agreement. The company has drawn on $ 260 million, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. In addition, Circle K received a $ 60 million, 100-day extension of credit, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> also announced a $ 4.99 million loss, amounting to 16 cents per share, for the second quarter of its 1990 fiscal year. In the Aug. 1-Oct. 31 period, Circle K had revenues of $ 937.2 million, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said Last year, the company reported a $ 13.30 million profit, or 25 cents per fully diluted share, on sales of $ 851.67 million. Part of the loss stemmed from a $ 2.2 million charge in the company's failed attempts to find a buyer for itself. Circle K began the effort in May and abandoned it several months ago after Chairman <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Eller </PERSON> decided not to bid on a buyout. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> added that the operating results also included an after-tax loss of just over $ 1 million for its 50 percent share of a joint venture in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>'s secretary said he was unavailable for comment on the status of the corporation, which last month announced a restructuring that includes refinancing of debt, a salary freeze, layoffs and the sale of up to 590 stores deemed unprofitable. On Dec. 7, Circle 7 announced a Dec. 15 deadline to get ahead of its debt service with $ 20 million in credit. It said the banks which are part of its revolving-credit agreement agreed to make $ 10 million available, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, Circle K's largest stockholder, agreed to advance the same amount. The new agreement includes the banks, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> and `` certain issuers of letters of credit -LRB- which -RRB- ... have consented to refrain from taking actions to reduce their extensions of credit during the term of the short-term agreement,'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said in his statement. The covenants apply to $ 200 million in senior secured notes due Oct. 15, 1993. They require Circle K to maintain at the end of each quarter a minimum fixed-coverage ratio for the preceding 12 months, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Funds to make such payment are not presently available to the company,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. He said failure to meet the profit levels or negotiate the agreement struck late Friday would have forced the company to buy back $ 20 million of the long-term debt. According to company figures, <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> has long-term debt of about $ 1.1 billion, up from $ 844 million the year before, and paid $ 96 million in interest and debt expenses during the 1989 fiscal year. The company's financial woes followed explosive expansion which saw Circle K grow from about 1,000 convenience stores in 1984 to a high of 4,685. The financial statement Friday said the total had dropped to 4,677. The company owns about 12 percent of the stores; the others are franchised.
