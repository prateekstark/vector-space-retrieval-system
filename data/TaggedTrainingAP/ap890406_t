 <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trippet </PERSON> has done his best to make certain visitors to his world-famous <LOCATION> Southfork </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> can see everything they believe <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has to offer. He has installed a 183-foot-tall oil derrick. He has stocked lush pastures with a longhorn cattle and championship racehorses. And as for a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> millionaire? Well, he says, he just walks around the grounds as often as he can. <PERSON> Trippet </PERSON>'s ranch about 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> is the model for the Ewing spread in the television series `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' The ranch, with its stately white two-story ranchhouse and immense outbuildings, is sometimes incorrectly placed in neighboring towns. But <PERSON> Trippet </PERSON> prefers the townname of <LOCATION> Southfork </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION>, and he lets everyone know it's all his. `` I'm the mayor and I'm the city council and I'm the building inspector,'' he says, wearing a sly grin that's shaded by a $ 3,000 cowboy hat. `` That's the only way I could have gotten all these things built around here.'' What was once a fairly nice country ranch is becoming an international tourist attraction. <PERSON> Trippet </PERSON> says you can stand on any part of the ranch and hear about 10 languages spoken in one hour. It sounds like an idle boast until the next group of tourists strolls by. A camera-snapping couple is from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A young family with two children is from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. And a woman who rolls into <PERSON> Trippet </PERSON>'s path and levels a camera lens at his head has a British accent `` You look just like <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON>, coming down there,'' she says, as she shoots. He does resemble <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>, who raises the ire and interest of millions of TV fans worldwide. On this day, the tall Texan is wearing a leather vest, western shirt, a pair of sharply pressed jeans and ostrich-skin boots. Like <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON>, the 44-year-old <PERSON> Trippet </PERSON> is fond of that disappearing <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> pastime _ making money. And he made his through _ you guessed it _ oil. `` You want to know the most expensive souvenir around here,'' he says, then points at himself. `` Me _ that's what. And I'm not cheap.'' <PERSON> Trippet </PERSON>, who bought the ranch in 1984 for a `` very big'' price, says if <ORGANIZATION> Southfork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> looks a bit commercial, that's because it's meant to make money From the $ 1.75 chili dogs to the ranchhouse, which he rents for $ 2,500 a night for overnight visitors, the showplace is meant to be a money-making proposition. `` Besides,'' he says. `` That $ 2,500 is nothing. A good penthouse is going to cost you that much to rent. ... `` But anything you see here is for sale. You want to buy those shrubs and I'll go dig them up myself.'' His latest enterprise could be the start of something very big. This Friday, Saturday and Sunday, <PERSON> Trippet </PERSON> is holding the <ORGANIZATION> Southfork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiques </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spectacular </ORGANIZATION>. More than $ 3 million worth of antique furniture, chandeliers, carpets and jewelry will be offered for sale. The auction will include a <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> XV </ORGANIZATION> dining room transferred intact to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> from a Scottish castle. It's being offered by <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> socialite. For the occasion, <PERSON> Trippet </PERSON> is selling the contents of his ranchhouse. He says he will then refill the house and sell all those items at the next auction. As <PERSON> Trippet </PERSON> ambles back to the ranch office to check calls before roaring off in a gold Mercedes, he does n't miss a step when asked about his favorite part of the ranch. `` My cash register,'' he says. `` And those tour buses parked over there. I love to see those dollar bills walking in.''

 The diaper business has hit bottom, forcing the last remaining diaper service in <LOCATION> Berkshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to call it quits. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, vice president of <LOCATION> Aladco </LOCATION>, said that with more parents using disposable diapers his customers have dropped from 400 a decade ago to a mere 60 scattered across the county. `` We ca n't operate at that low a volume,'' he said Tuesday. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said he had hoped negative publicity about disposable diapers choking landfills would slow the trend, but that did n't happen Toward the end, he found that he could n't even give away his business. People declined, even when diaper service was offered as a gift, <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said. And so, in May, the Adams company, which also operates a laundry, dry cleaning and linen and uniform rental business, is dropping its diaper division.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sex Aid. Keep a little tin box by the bed, and donate 25 pence every time, uh, you know, whenever you do. Wink wink, nudge nudge. The campaign announced by <ORGANIZATION> Marie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stopes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a charity which supports family planning in the Third World, sounds like a publicity stunt. It is a publicity stunt. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hindmarsh </PERSON>, fund-raising manager for the charity, said Wednesday that it has been working away quietly for 20 years, `` talking earnestly to people _ and it has n't done the trick.'' `` We now realize that we need more hype like Band Aid and Comic Relief to draw people's attention to the problem, so we are asking people to make love and save the world.'' At the suggested rate of 25 pence -LRB- 43 cents -RRB-, Ms. <PERSON> Hindmarsh </PERSON> said the average British couple could give 12.50 pounds -LRB- about $ 21.25 -RRB- a year. `` They can save it up or write us a check every six months or put it in a little tin by the bed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hindmarsh </PERSON> said. `` We do n't really care how they do it,'' she confessed. `` At the end of the day we just want their money.'' There is a serious point too: `` I think it will help people focus on the fact that they have the freedom to make love without producing another mouth to feed,'' she said.

 The body of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> still is well-preserved after 65 years on lying in state in <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, Pravda reported, and is in no immediate danger of decomposition. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Debov </PERSON>, head of the laboratory overseeing the body, as confirming long speculation that scientists at first did not think they could preserve the remains of the Soviet founder, who died in 1924. He said they considered a refrigeration system, but instead decided on `` anatomical-biochemical methods,'' the paper reported Wednesday. <PERSON> Debov </PERSON> did not go into details on how the body is maintained, but disclosed that the fight against decomposition was so intense at first that scientists had to work around the clock to preserve it. He said the preservation process still requires `` daily vigilant observation'' and that the body `` is guaranteed for an extended period of time.'' The body lies beneath glass in a special marble-and-granite mausoleum in Red Square. Five days a week, visitors are hustled past the body in a dimly lit room where no photographs are allowed. Mass demand that <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s body lie permanently displayed prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership to overrule <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Nadezhda </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupskaya </PERSON>, who opposed having her husband embalmed.

<TEXT>
 The murderous bombardment in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the worst in four years, has squeezed people's daily lives to four hours of scurrying about their business and 20 hours underground. When Syrian and Christian artillery gunners rest at daybreak, thousands of trapped residents cautiously emerge from bunkers. Their first order of business is to hurriedly buy fresh supplies of food, water, candles, gas lamps, decks of cards and sleeping pills. Just before the antagonists resume the deadly duel that began three weeks ago, they rush back to shelters on both sides of the Green Line that divides the city into Moslem and Christian sectors. Most nightclubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and movie houses are closed. So are schools and universities. Banks operate haphazardly for two or three hours a day, depending on the ferocity of the shelling. `` The only thing that matters nowadays is self-preservation,'' said <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Trad </PERSON>, a pharmacist in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ashrafiyeh </LOCATION> district. `` Survival is the name of the game.'' He did not recall a similar stampede for sleeping pills in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year civil war. `` I do n't have statistics. But if this continues, we will soon run out of tranquilizers,'' said Trad, whose pharmacy is shielded by tall sandbag walls. There are no severe shortages at present. Wholesalers try to monopolize goods in order to raise prices, and stores order new stock during lulls in the fighting. Some residents manage to joke about the shelling. `` Tell my friends in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> not to worry about me,'' said <PERSON> Bahjat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>, a police reporter who lives in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Maameltein suburb Like many others, he commuted between <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s two sectors before the latest round of fighting `` I have all the fireworks. Some 200 shells explode around my apartment nightly. The house is always shaking like a swing, and I am swinging,'' quipped <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>, 55. A Greek Catholic bachelor, <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> does not use the basement shelter of his seaside apartment building because his 92-year-old mother can hardly move. `` I simply ca n't leave her alone.'' When a missile detonated a large gas storage tank at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> port, winds blew the flame and smoke in the direction of his house, 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` I'm lik a roasted chicken,'' he joked to friends on the telephone. The fighting pits army commander Gen. Mily Christian units against an alliance of Syrian troops and Druse Moslem militiamen. It was touched off by an air-and-sea blockade <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> clamped on militia-run illegal ports on March 6 in a bid to reinstate government authority. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in the fractured nation's dual government. The Syrians and <LOCATION> Mosmilitia </LOCATION> allies, who recognize the rival Moslem Cbinet of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, retaliated by sealis to the Christian enclave and blockading its 1 million inhabitts with their bato the sea. Ensuing bouts of savage bombardment have blown hundreds of houses, wrecked power plants, destroyed city water pipes and threatened to crush the nation's infrstructure. Police statistics show an average of 3,000 shells fell on the city and its environs every day of the past three weeks, killing more than 150 people and wounding 500. Mor than 90 have been killed and 300 wounded in easnd the adjoining Christian hinterland. The other casulaties were in the city's Moslem sector and Druse-controlled hills. <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>, 38, a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> grcer, said he has been surviving with his wife aong with 40 neighbors in the candle-lit basement of their 6-story apartment building. `` I death so close. I give up,'' he said at the doorstep of their shelter in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s poor <LOCATION> Einrict </LOCATION>. `` We're suffocating. I do n't think we're e.'' <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON> opens his store only during morning lulls in shelling. <PERSON> Shukri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahhoud </PERSON>, a banker who lives posh, hilltop <LOCATION> Rabieh </LOCATION> district on east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s northern flank, was more optimistic. `` We ` to make it,'' he `` I do n't think the world is going to al the annihilation of 1 million Christians. Thisng to stop.'' <PERSON> Lahhoud </PERSON> said he and his neighbors while away the hours in running games of poker and backgamloor underground shelter, which houses a power generator. The city's Moslem sector is virtually a ghost town. Tens of thousands of residents have fled to relative safety in east and south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Those who stayed behind also spend nights in shelters as soldiers with multibarreled mobile rocket launchers roam around, firing off a barrage, then moving quickly before retaliatory fire comes. Civilians take the punishment. `` It's a dirty trick but no one dares protest it,'' ident who requested anonymity.

Over <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s objections, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was released from prison March 22, a few weeks after a state court overturned his conviction for the 1976 slaying of a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> policeman. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> had spent more than 12 years in prison. The case was examined in <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' 1988 documentary, `` The Thin Blue Line,'' which questioned evidence in the case. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who served as an assistant district attorney in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for 21 years, participated in the original prosecution of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was ordered released after the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said evidence had been suppressed and at least two witnesses lied on the stand. In fighting <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' release, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said state District Court Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> and eight of the nine appellate judges were biased in <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' favor. He asked that <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> be removed from the case. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s arguments held up <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' release for one night before another state judge ruled in <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' favor. The day after <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' release, <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said evidence to retry him was lacking, and the murder charge was dropped. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said he'd investigate <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s behavior as a personnel matter.

<HEAD>Adopted Baron Misses Deadline For Keeping Castle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 There was no happy ending to the fairy tale-like life that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> has lived since being adopted last summer by a childless West German baron. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> missed a bank's deadline for coming up with $ 3 million to keep the baron's 1,429-year-old castle in the family. The West German bank that has a lien on the 150-room castle and 970-acre estate plans to put the property up for sale. As the adopted son of 76-year-old <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Freiherr </PERSON> <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> vonLiebieg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> stood to inherit the castle and surrounding vineyards on the <LOCATION> Mosel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at the foot of the <LOCATION> Eifel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The value of the castle and estate is estimated at $ 10 million. But <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> said he has something more important than a castle. `` I still have this wonderful birthright and a wonderful father and I plan to be a good baron and good son,'' <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I think we're all disappointed, but the baron has never asked about the castle. He only wants to know when I am coming back to visit.'' VonLiebieg selected <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON>, in part because of his German heritage, from more than 10,000 people worldwide who responded to the baron's televised plea for an heir on the syndicated show `` A Current Affair'' last June. <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> did n't know at the time that he would be asked to save the family's deteriorating estate, which was taken over by the bank when a German businessman who had purchased the castle from vonLiebieg defaulted on a loan. The baron has not lived in the castle for more than a dozen years. He lives with his wife in a nearby villa. <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON>, a 57-year-old businessman, said he will continue to work to purchase the castle for as long as it remains for sale, but about 18 private and corporate investors, including a German hotel chain have lined up to purchase the estate from the bank. `` I've been a rainbow chaser all my life,'' said <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON>, who lives in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ferrysburg </LOCATION>. `` I guess I'll always continue to do that _ I'm too old to do otherwise.

<HEAD>Cigarette Smoking Boosts Metabolism, Burns 100 Calories a Day</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Smoking makes the body burn more calories, according to a study that helps explain one of life's biological injustices: why people put on weight when they give up cigarettes. The research publi care of about 100 calories a day for the typical smoker. Smokers typically weigh five to 10 pounds less than non-smokers, and they usually put on that much weight when they break the habit. The question has been why this happens. Part of the reason is that folks often eat more when they stop smoking, and some studies have shown they are more likely to crave sugar. While preliminary evidence suggested that they also burned calories more slowly, many experts thought this effect was small. In the past, scientists have studied this by watching changes in metabolism when people smoke while sitting still. In the lastest work, researchers decided to see what happened to metabolism when people smoked while moving around, just as they do in real lifeought it was conceivable we would n't see any effect,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, who directed the <ORGANIZATION> Universityrgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> study that's published in the New England Journal of Medicine. `` To our surprise, whe opposite, that it was much more enhanced. It reversed our thinking. The implication is that the metabolic eing -RRB- is much more important than everyone else has considered.' When staying ng increases metabolism by about 5 percent. But it raises it by about 12 percent. Among other things, this could help explain hy some people balloon when they quit cigaretteothers manage to hold their weight steady. `` If people tenn coffee breaks or while relaxing at home watching TV, they wo n't gain as much weight'' when they quit, said <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>. `` Those who smoke while active are likely to be thinnero begin with because of their smoking.'' So they risk putting on more when they stop smoking.. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigotti </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> noted that some people, especiall keep smoking because they are afraid of gaining weight. `` Until our cultural obsession wih slenderness abates,'' she wrote, `` we must pay more attention to the way weight gain impedes efforts to stop smoking if we are to continue the progress of the past quarter century toward a smoke-free society.'' Exprts note that while obesity is dangerous, smokers should not leof gaining weight keep them from quitting. `` Your health risk is immeasurably improved whestop smoking, no matter how much weight you gain,'' said <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>. He also pointed out that people can offset their newly slowed metabolisttle extra exercise. `` All you would need to do is walk about a mile extra er that,'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said. `` That' hard as it sounds.''

<HEAD>Glitter, Elegance of White House Past is Displayed at Smithsonian</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nearly forgotten mantelpiece that formed the backdrop for <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s famous `` fireside chats'' is the surprise feature of a new <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> exhibition recreating the glitter and elegance of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in a bygone era. The permanent installation in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION>, entitled `` The Ceremonial Court,'' shows the front hallway of the White House as it appeared from a 1903 restoration until 1952. The 1903 restoration, conducted by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> architect <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Follen </PERSON> <PERSON> McKim </PERSON>, took six months and cost about $ 500,000. The Smithsonian display required more than four years of planning and eight months to install, at a cost of nearly $ 1 million. The project was underwritten largely by a grant from <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` This is a permanent statement of the highest and most elegant reaches of American craftsmanship,'' said museum director <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The White House, he said, represented `` a courtly life, a life of high style. It's always opening night at court ... the night for grand occasions, for getting out the very best china.'' Among the items in the exhibition, which opens today, is the mantelpiece from the fireplace in the Diplomatic Reception Room that was the scene of <ORGANIZATION> FDR </ORGANIZATION>'s radio broadcasts to a Depression-weary public in the 1930s. When <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, undertook a major renovation of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1952, the mantelpiece and other unwanted objects were donated to the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>, which crated them for storage in its sprawling warehouses in suburban <LOCATION> Suitland </LOCATION>, Md. There the mantelpiece gathered dust, its existence recorded only on a Smithsonian catalog card, until the pile of crates marked `` White House'' was discovered nearly 30 years later by <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrigan </PERSON>, the museum's newly appointed assistant director for exhibits. In that moment, <PERSON> Carrigan </PERSON> envisioned a permanent museum exhibition of historic White House treasures drawn from the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s vast collections. The centerpiece of the resulting display is a recreation of the front hallway, stretching from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION> to the State Dining Room, as it appeared beginning with <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s presidency. While the hallway reflects the formal, chandeliered elegance of the turn-of-the-century White House, there are hints of the boisterous Teddy Roosevelt household. Just outside a trompe l'oeil painting of the State Dining Room is the family elevator. Inside is a mannequin of one of <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION>'s six children with their pet pony, <PERSON> Algonquin </PERSON>, which once was smuggto greet a bedrivelt At the other end of the hall is a second trompe l'oeil painting of the main stairway, with <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> and brother <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON> playing at the bottom with a paint set and their pet macaw, one of a menagerie that also included three rats, a terrier, a kitten, a flying squirrel and a green snake named <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinach </PERSON>. Among the objects in adjoining rooms is a gold Steinway grand piano that was donated to the White House in 1930 and used until 1939. The piano, still being restored by <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> conservators, was richly decorated brtist <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewing </PERSON> with an allegorical painting, acanthus garlands and scrollwork. The exhibit features cases of White House children's dolls and toys, inaugural gowns worn by first ladies since <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> china and silver used by first families sinceeorge and <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. Presidential leisure-time memorabilia on display include <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s leather dispatch case and English-made telescope, a chess set used by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> and balls monogrammed `` WGH,'' <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s silver cigar cutter, <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s well-chewed <PERSON> Meerschaum </PERSON> pipe and a life preserver from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s yacht, `` Honey Fitz.''

 A dead rat might not be worth a rat's whisker in <LOCATION> Lapeer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> soon, or even the 10-cent bounty allowed by an obscure state law The 1915 law provides the bounty to anyone who kills a rat and turns it over in a state of `` good preservation'' to their municipal clerk. The clerk is to burn the rat's head and authorize payment through the county. But the law also allows county boards of commissioners to rescind the bounty, a move that <LOCATION> Lapeer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Clerk <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thick </PERSON> said in a recent interview that she would welcome. `` I'm sure they have not done that, but we'll be doing that soon,'' she said. `` It'll be presented to the Board of Commissioners immediately.'' The bounty law surfaced recently during the celebration of Marathon Township's 150th anniversary of incorporation. Township Clerk <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ring </PERSON> recalled receiving an anonymous letter in 1985 from a resident who said he had killed 76 rats and wanted to know whether he had to cut off their heads before receiving his $ 7.60 bounty. `` I went to the board meeting wearing surgical gloves that month,'' Ring said. `` I actually had visions of a sack of rats appearing on the front doorstep.'' But the rat slayer never has come forward. Marathon Township, meanwhile, also has on its books a $ 5 bounty for wolves, in effect since 1839.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, disappointed that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is not withdrawing military support from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, is accusing the Soviet president of empty rhetoric regarding Central American peace. `` While his words about not exporting revolution are welcomed, they are not matched by deeds which would give those words credence,'' White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Wednesday, referring to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s denunciation of the export of revolution. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s comments in his speech in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> on Tuesday conflicted with the policy of Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who supports the spread of revolutionary movements. But, in a written statement read by <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> called on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to back up his statements about wanting demilitarized peace zones in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, by discontinuing military assistance to the leftist government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` Today, we call upon the Soviets to cut off their half-billion-dollar annual military aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Soviets continue to pour arms into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, a country whose army is already larger than those of all their neighbors combined,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said continued Soviet activity in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will affect U.S.-Soviet relations, but declined to specify how the administration might express its displesure. `` We've never made linkage threats,'' he said. `` But we have always said these are the kinds of things that influence the relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' A day earlier, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had said Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>'s statements against the export of revolution appeared to be a positive sign. But on Wednesday he was more resng, `` We can hold out a little optimism on the basis of the words,'' but that the administration is looking for deedsto back them up. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials looked to the Soviet leader's visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as an opportunity for him to change direction in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had written him urging Soviet withdrawal of military support from the leftist Nicaraguan government, and a halt to Cuban and Nicaraguan support for leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in his Tuesday speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will not has support for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as long <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues military assistance to other governments in the region. Fitzwatert comparable to the Soviet assistance because the U.S.-backed nations `` are not involved in subversion of their neighbors.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials estimate the Soviets shipped more than $ 500 million in military aid last year to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and gave <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> the same amount in economic asse the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has bankrolled the Contra rebels fighting to oust the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s shift to a diplomatic course means <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras is now non-military. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> this decade totals some $ 3.5 billion, and the administration accuses the Soviets of supporting the Salvadoran rebels through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>New Rules Ban Conflict of Interest in Medical Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors participating in a major study of treatment after coronary bypass surgery will be barred from owning stock in the companies whose medicines are being tested, according to guidelines released today. The rules are intended to prevent any conflict of interest that might sway researchers when they analyze the results. Doctors who drew up the guidelines note that there are no widely accepted standards to prevent conflicts of interest for scientists doing research with products that have commercial value. `` We believe that a defined conflict-of-interest policy will protect the integrity of the study and the credibility of investigators as the trial is scrutinized by the scientific community and the public,'' the organizers wrote. The rules were drawn up by Dr. <PERSON> Bernadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and colleagues from the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. They were published in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, along with an editorial by its editor, Dr. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Relman </PERSON>. `` These are laudable voluntary guidelines, which for the time being other clinical investigators would do well to adopt,'' he wrote. The seven-year, federally funded study is called the Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Clinicial Trial. It will examine the effects of drug therapy and cholesterol lowering for people undergoing heart bypass surgery. During this surgery, doctors reroute blood around clogged heart arteries. However, the detours often become plugged after a few years, and the study is intended to see if treatment can keep this from happening. The study will test drugs produced by three companies. According to the new rules, all key researchers will be prohibited from owning stock in the drug companies or working for them as paid consultants. The ban also will extend to their spouses and dependents. Authors of the rules note that the outcome of this study could affect the care of millions of Americans undergoing bypass surgery.

The bill calls for closing times of 9 p.m. EST, 8 p.m. CST and 7 p.m. MST. In presidential election years only, the switch from daylight-saving time to standard time in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> time zone would be postponed a maximum of two weeks. Polls there would close at 7 p.m. PDT. Under the timetable, polling places would shut their doors simultaneously, making it impossible for results from some states to indicate a winner and influence turnout elsewhere. Only presidential years would be covered by the bill, which would take effect in 1992 and would not apply to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The plan is designed to dovetail with a 1985 agreement under which major television networks said they would voluntarily refrain from projecting election results within a state until the polls close there. It is unclear if local races are actually affected by early projections. House Rules Committee Chairman <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., however, said Tuesday that he believed the phenomenon may have contributed to the 1980 defeat of Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON>, D-Ore., then chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> Either way, lawmakers say voter frustration because of such projections is basically unhealthy. `` It's unfair to either party that the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> would announce the final result of an election to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> before the final votes are counted,'' Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quillen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Tenn </LOCATION>., told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> The only critic of the bill to take the floor, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., described it as `` a <PERSON> Rube </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> device that will louse up the states, cause them a great deal of confusion and travail. He said it actually could reduce turnout by shortening voting hours on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and possibly prompting <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states to open the polls at later hours than they do now. Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, D-Wash., the measure's sponsor, said studies have shown an earlier poll closing will prompt voters to vote earlier and thus the fear of a drop in turnout `` is simply not substantiated by the facts. The extension of daylight-saving time in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> zone would take place only in presidential election years. It would last for a maximum of two weeks and apply to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> as well as the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> panhandle but not the rest of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Study Links Low Cholesterol and High Blood Pressure with Strokes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The risk of bleeding strokes is significantly higher than usual among men who have very low cholesterol levels but high blood pressure, a study published today concludes. The research found that men with blood cholesterol levels under 160 were three times more likely than those with higher cholesterol levels to suffer bleeding strokes. But this increase appeared to be explained entirely by a substantially higher risk in those with high blood pressure. The researchers said the findings should not be taken as an excuse to stop trying to lower cholesterol to prevent heart disease. Of the 350,977 men studied, 3,986 had unusually low cholesterol levels _ under 160 milligrams per deciliter of blood, and diastolic blood pressures above 90, which is considered to be elevated. In this group, there were nine bleeding strokes, a rate that works out to 23 strokes for every 10,000 men. By comparison, among men with low cholesterol but low blood pressure as well, there were just under two bleeding strokes per 10,000 people, the same as for all men with low blood pressure. The men with low cholesterol levels did not face any unusual risk of strokes resulting from blood clots inside the brain. These are more common than bleeding strokes. The men with low cholesterol also had a sharply lower risk of dying from all kinds of cardiovascular disease. For those with cholesterols between 140 and 160, there were 46 cardiovascular deaths per 10,000 people, compared with 83 cardiovascular deaths for the total group. The study was based on the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial. The latest analysis, by Dr. <PERSON> Hiroyasu </PERSON> <PERSON> Iso </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, was published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. `` Our findings should not be taken as a reason to defer the establishment of programs to lower serum -LRB- blood -RRB- cholesterol levels in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population in order to prevent coronary heart disease,'' the researchers concluded. They speculated that very low cholesterol may weaken the walls of arteries in the head, while high blood pressure makes them break.

<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s insistence on cutting the capital gains tax is a `` thorn in our negotiations'' as <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and congressional bargainers try to complete a budget agreement. `` I think we're confused,'' Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., said Wednesday night, after a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> `` We're a room of good intentions,'' he said, but, `` there's a difficult thorn in our negotiations and that's capital gains.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> have been meeting with key members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to craft a plan for meeting the goal of a $ 100 billion deficit in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. About $ 28 billion in either new revenues or spending restraint would be needed to meet that goal, according to White House estimates. As part of the deficit reduction plan in his fiscal 1990 budget, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed cutting the tax rate on capital gains to 15 percent, about in half. The president contends the rate cut would raise about $ 4.8 billion in revenue. However, congressional estimates show the reduction would be a big revenue loser in the long run and, Democrats contend, the rich would benefit the most from the tax break. Although his own budget included several billion dollars in tax increases and new user fees, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contends those did not violate his campaign pledge against any new taxes. With Democrats opposing the capital gains scheme, coming up with a deficit-reduction plan has proven difficult since alternative tax revenues or more spending cuts would be needed. Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, has proposed in the talks that half the deficit reduction, about $ 14 billion, come from revenues _ a combination of taxes, sales of government assets, and new user fees <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s revenue proposals produced about the same amount, but included the claimed capital gains influx He said Wednesday that resolution of the tax issue is crucial to the success of the talks. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said he was not discouraged, but it would be difficult. `` We're going to continue to talk ... but I do n't know that we're going to meet any of the deadlines,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has an April 15 deadline for completing the budget. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> declined to comment on the specifics of the meeting. `` It's just part of the budget process,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. Asked if he had brought something new to discuss, he said, `` I did n't bring a thing.''

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s call for an end to the `` export of revolution and counterrevolution'' to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> disappointed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysts who were hoping for a stronger sign that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would curtail its military aid to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials, pursuing a more conciliatory Central American policy than President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, agreed with congressional leaders last month not to seek military aid for the Contra guerrillas of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. They hoped that in response, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would curtail the estimated $ 6 billion in aid the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> sends to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the $ 1 billion in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc assistance to leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` While his words about not exporting revolution are welcome, they are not matched by deeds which would give his words credence,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, meeting in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, scolded Western media for reporting a Cuban-Soviet rift and gave no indication that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would be cutting its aid to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island, estimated at about $ 6 billion a year. `` As in the past, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have a common approach to the key problems of international affairs,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` The most immediate task is to solve so-called regional conflicts. `` We are resolutely against any theories and doctrines justifying the export of revolution or counterrevolution, and all forms of interference in the affairs of sovereign nations,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would welcome `` the reduction of Soviet military support in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or if they mean that Soviet surrogates would cease supporting'' insurgents in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Instead, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> condemned <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> `` meddling in Afghan affairs.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been sending an estimated $ 500 million a year in covert aid to the anti-communist guerrillas of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, helping secure the negotiated withdrawal of Soviet troops last February. Many Americans have engaged in `` wishful thinking,'' hoping that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would seek to ease economic problems at home by curtailing aid to revolutionary movements abroad, particularly <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiarda </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>. But `` there is no evidence whatsoever that the Soviets have started to reduce military aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or to the rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Wiarda </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may be pressuring <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in private meetings to tone down his revolutionary rhetoric, and may ultimately curtail Soviet aid to leftist insurgencies, `` I think it unrealistic to expect <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to change those policies quickly,'' said <PERSON> Wiarda </PERSON>. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> applauded <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s statement on the export of revolution, while at the same time criticizing <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s past policies. `` I hope <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> follows <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s advice,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION> `` Certainly, much of our trouble in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> comes from <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> activities. If they can be closed down, this will help peace to come to that troubled region.'' A former Cuban diplomat now living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Benemelis </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> `` expectations were too high for this meeting.'' `` I think there is definitely conflict between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, but that it will take some time'' to become public, said <PERSON> Benemelis </PERSON>, who worked in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> before defecting in 1980. <PERSON> Benemelis </PERSON> has seen hints that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will reduce aid to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as well as pressure <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to curtail military interference in other countries, but does n't think the trend will become obvious until both countries enter their next five-year economic period in 1991. `` Since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power, the Soviets have been asking the Cubans to fulfill their annual trade agreements. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has had problems, for example, filling his sugar quota. He has not been doing it,'' he said. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who opposes the type of political reforms <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is pressing in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that no such changes are needed in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` But if Soviet aid was reduced, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> would face a political crisis,'' said <PERSON> Benemelis </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader, who has developed strong ties to the Soviet military and intelligence agencies over the decades, may be biding his time, hoping that conservatives in those organizations will force <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> from power, said <PERSON> Benemelis </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is betting on the opposition,'' said <PERSON> Benemelis </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Administration Seeks Change in Law to Ease Soviet Emigrant Surge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is seeking changes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law to allow up to 150,000 Soviets to immigrate to this country over the next five years after a flood of visa applications caught the government off guard. The adminstration has been the target of criticism from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> for its tangled approach to the flood of applications, coming primarily from Soviet Jews. More than 4,000 Jews were allowed to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last month, the highest total in 10 years. For years, the administration has demanded that the Soviets loosen their stranglehold on emigrant applications, but once the flood began under Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the exodus appeared to overwhelm <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. In order to remedy the situation, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced on Wednesday that the agency had sent legislation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to allow 30,000 immigrant visas per year over a period of five years for those people `` whose admission would be in our foreign policy interest,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>. While the spokesman said the primary beneficiaries of the new legislation `` are likely to be Soviet citizens,'' the law could be used for other nationalities. `` We're trying to make sure we take care of everybody from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> who wants to come in,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. But Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on immigration, refugees and international law, said the administration proposal does n't deal adequately with the problem of Soviet Jewish refugees `` It creates an unprecedented ` pick and choose' immigration policy,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` It allows the president to choose people from different areas who are not immigrants or refugees.'' After his subcommittee holds a hearing today on Soviet refugees, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said, he plans to introduce legislation that would deal with the Soviet Jewish refugee situation `` narrowly, expeditiously and with adequate resources for resettlement.'' <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> says that in order to help clear up the backlog of Soviet visa applicants in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, he is sending additional inspectors to both cities to help speed up the processing. More than 19,000 Soviets are waiting to be interviewed at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for permission to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as refugees, and another 7,000 are waiting in temporary quarters near <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. The current rate of Soviet applications has been running about 4,000 a month. At that rate, the allocated refugee slots were due to run out shortly. Those being denied access under the refugee quotas were offered parolee status, but that did not give them government funding, nor did it allow the applicants to apply eventually for citizenship. Last summer, the backup problem was exacerbated by a change in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy that ordered <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to determine refugee status for Soviets case-by-case rather than as a group. That is true for other refugee applicants. As a stop-gap measure, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in January shifted 7,000 unused slots meant for Vietnamese refugees to accommodate the Soviet overflow. Although some estimates project about 40,000 Soviet applicants this year, the administration had budgeted for only half that number. In a statement, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the legislation was not specific to nationality in order to provide the president with some `` flexibility'' in case he wanted to apply it to another nation at some other point. He pointed out that the law could apply to <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> people who obtained exit visas from their homeland but do not qualify for refugee status under current immigration law. All immigrants have to prove that they would not become a ward of the state by showing that they had a job offer or some other means of financial support, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. The new legislation does not contain any request for funding for the additional immigrants, although the White House has requested $ 100 million from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in supplemental funding for migration and refugee assistance. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the administration also hoped that voluntary agencies would be able to help make up the shortfall. As well, he added, `` We're hopeful that friends and relatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be able to provide such assistance.''

<HEAD>Death-Defying Dining Is Here _ Fugu Comes To America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American diners with a death wish can now risk sushi-cide with fugu, a seafood delicacy that becomes the last supper for 100 Japanese each year. The raw fish arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last week, appearing on the menus of seven <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> restaurants and making the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the only country outside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> where fugu is found. But the man who brought the gourmet delight stateside promised Wednesday this fugu could n't hurt a fly, unlike the badly prepared fugu that's fatal to half the people who eat it. Every year about 100 Japanese eat a fatal fugu meal. `` There is no danger at all,'' said a confident <PERSON> Nobuyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuraoka </PERSON>, owner of Restaurant Nippon in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` In the 50 years since the war, there is no single instance of poisoning from the tiger puffer fish prepared by a licensed chef in the city of <LOCATION> Shimonoseki </LOCATION>.'' With that in mind, all 265 pounds of fugu flown frozen into <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was prepared for delivery in that Japanese city. <PERSON> Kuraoka </PERSON> stressed its safety, but tales of fugu past provide another picture. Fugu has been a taste treat in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for more than 2,000 years. There are 15 different kinds of fugu, all prepared from puffer fish. If not properly cleaned, the fish can be fatal _ its entrails, liver and ovaries contain the deadly toxin tetrodotoxin. The removal of the dangerous organs is handled by special chefs in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with at least 13 years' experience. To insure smooth sailing with this first fugu shipment, <PERSON> Kuraoka </PERSON> had a chef with 53 years experience, <PERSON> Sakae </PERSON> <PERSON> Hata </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Shimonoseki </LOCATION>, handle inspection in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and upon arrival here. `` No other fish is treated as strictly as this fugu today. Inspectors at <LOCATION> Shimonoseki </LOCATION> observed the whole process,'' said <PERSON> Kuraoka </PERSON>. The go-ahead for importation was given in November 1988 after a year of intense negotiations between the two countries, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lecos </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Fugu now will be allowed into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> up to three times per year between September and March when the fish are in season. Fugu had been on the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s automatic detention list for eight years, <PERSON> Lecos </PERSON> said. The ban made <PERSON> Kuraoka </PERSON> a man with a mission: bringing fugu to this country. `` I was asked by three or four food critics in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to bring it in, and by the Japanese people staying in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kuraoka </PERSON>. `` They miss fugu so much.'' Why would anyone miss raw fish that much? `` It has a very mysterious taste, profound and unforgettable,'' explained <PERSON> Kuraoka </PERSON>, who charges between $ 35 and $ 60 per person for a fugu sashimi platter, $ 50 a plate for fugu hors d'oeuvres. His opinion was not exactly echoed by two women in the restaurant who'd tried the dish and lived to tell about it. `` Bland,'' offered one. `` Somewhere between squid and fluke,'' said the other. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Kuraoka </PERSON> was confident fugu would find its place in the American market. `` The tiger puffer fish is the best delicacy in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It's a huge fish, a beautiful fish. This is our very best and also our most expensive. ... I'm very happy and very proud.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials warned <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to intensify its anti-drug efforts after the agency seized an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> jetliner with nearly two tons of marijuana. `` Security procedures on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> are dismal at best,'' <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We hope -LRB- this -RRB- seizure will attract their attention.'' Inspectors found 3,595 pounds of marijuana packed into two unlisted containers in the cargo hold of the Airbus A-300 that had flown from <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. `` You could smell it from 50 feet away,'' he said. `` We just can not comprehend how the Jamaicans could not have discovered it, and allowed it to leave the country.'' Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, the plane was seized and government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> could be liable for a fine of $ 28.7 million. Impounded aircraft usually are released after payment of a small percentage of the penalty. Larger marijuana shipments have been intercepted on ships and cargo planes, but Tuesday's seizure was the most within memory aboard a scheduled commercial airliner, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. As customs officials Wednesday were announcing that find, three men carrying shoulder bags with a total of 60 pounds of pot were nabbed on another Air <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> flight here, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Heavey </PERSON>, customs regional director, said the plane seizure marked the 130th time since 1980 that shipments were stopped on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> flights. Agents have intercepted a total of almost 9 tons of the drug. `` Customs is very concerned that _ despite the rhetoric and the propaganda that we've been receiving from <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> _ the security is almost totally ineffective,'' <PERSON> Heavey </PERSON> said. `` We've got to do more to stop the use of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> aircraft as conveyances to smuggle marijuana.'' He said theency was particularly incensed that the two large cargo containers were not not on the flight manifest. Inside the containers, agents found 88 cardboard boxes, including 29 filled with clothes and the rest stuffed with marijuana. Inspectors did not immediately grab the drug, owing it to be picked up at the airport. They then followed a rental truck carrying the pot to south <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, stopping it and arresting the driver, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, after he appeared to be taking evasive maneuvers, authorities said

<HEAD>Malaysian Legislature Enacts Law Against Eating Turtle Eggs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an anti-extinction effort, a state legislature has enacted a law under which anyone caught with the eggs of leatherback turtles can be fined up to $ 363 or sentenced to six months in jail. Many Malaysians eat the eggs as a delicacy, believing they increase sexual prowess. The law passed Wednesday by the <LOCATION> Trengganu </LOCATION> state assembly in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trengganu </LOCATION>, 180 miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur, says the only lawful purpose for keeping the eggs is for hatching by the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngah </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he proposed the law because the number of leatherback turtles laying eggs in Rantau <PERSON> Abang </PERSON>, near <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trengganu </LOCATION>, had declined to about 500 in recent years and measures were needed to prevent their extinction. The turtles, measuring as much as five feet in diameter and weighing up to 900 pounds, range the seas as far as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> but return to the beaches of Rantau <PERSON> Abang </PERSON> each June to August to lay their eggs. Scientists say the turtles, which live as long as 100 years, return each year to the exact beach where they were born to lay up to 70 eggs.

 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive tapped for deputy defense secretary, is promising to sell his more than $ 3 million in company stock to avoid any conflict of interest. The vice chairman of the giant automaker also said Wednesday that he took out an insurance policy to guarantee his <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> pension should the company fail, to protect against any suggestion he would use his government office to protect the company for the sake of a pension. `` This is way beyond what is remotely reasonable,'' Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in praise of <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>'s efforts `` You've done an extraordinary thing,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` You've probably gone overboard ... you've done it at a great expense to yourself. <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, 64, owns about $ 1.4 million in restricted <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> stock options and about $ 1.2 million in Class E common stock as well as other types of common stock estimated at over $ 750,000, according to congressional sources.

Financial disclosure forms only require listing a range of assets. <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, a member of the board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> since May 1987, made his unusual financial promises just one month after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first choice for defense secretary. Senators cited allegations of excessive drinking and womanizing as well as the appearance of conflict of interest in voting against Tower. The former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator had received more than $ 1 million in consulting fees from defense contractors after leaving government service. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> later confirmed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s second nominee for defense secretary, Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>.

On other issues, <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> expressed his support for purchasing commercial products if they are available at lower costs than those manufactured by defense contractors. The nominee also told <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> that the departmet's top defense priorities are a national secur under way, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition system and the ethics problems in the wake of the `` Ill Wind'' procurement scandal. `` We do n't just issue a pamphlet -LRB- on ethics -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said. `` We have to makee that they have the training.''

<HEAD>Housing Stock up, but Young Couples Face Price Crunch</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Young couples still dream of home ownerhip, but higher housing prices and delayed marriages mean a longer wait for the reality. Couples in their 20s traditionally provide the population fuel for growing house sales, but they are losing the ability to cover down payments on starter homes, housing analyst <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Devaney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Between 1975 and 1985 the median income of couples in their 20s rose 80 percent while housing prices climbed 125 percent, <PERSON> Devaney </PERSON> reported in a new bureau analysis: `` Housing in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> 1985-86.'' The financial constraints on these young couples have n't dampened the growth in housing much, it would seem, with the report showing that the nation's housing stock grew twice as fast as the population Housing increased by 26 percent between the mid-1970s and 1985 while the population of the country grew by just 11 percent over the same period, the Census study showed. Helping absorb the increase are the shrinkage in average household size from 2.94 to 2.69 people during the decade _ requiring more homes for the same number of people _ and the number of people investing in seasonal and recreational houses, <PERSON> Devaney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Devaney </PERSON> said the growth in housing prices is forcing young couples to delay purchasing their first home. The starter, or first, home is usually the hardest for a couple to make a down payment on, since the down payment on a subsequent house usually can be obtained from the sale of the prior one. The median price of first homes rose from $ 27,100 in 1975 to $ 61,000 1985, 125 percent, <PERSON> Devaney </PERSON> said. At the same time the median income of married couples who rented a home climbed only 80 percent, from $ 12,300 to $ 22,200. <PERSON> Devaney </PERSON> explained in a telephone interview, is that young couples who used to move from the reer to owner category in their 20s are now delayransition into their 30s and later because theynger qualify for the mortgage loans. In 1975 three-fourths of married couples aged 25 to 35 qualified for an 80 percent mortgage, a figurel to less than half by 1985, the study found. asically there is still the desire, is sort of in our phyche in this country,'' to own a home, <PERSON> Devaney </PERSON> said. But realization of that desire is being delayed, and <PERSON> Devaney </PERSON> said he does n't expect any sudden turnaround in this situation. At the same time demographic reports show that young people are marrying later than they have in the past _ waiting until they've completed their educations and launched careers _ and are also postponing having children In addition to the rise in recreational and seasonal housing, <PERSON> Devaney </PERSON> noted that smaller households have taken up a large share of the increase in total homes in the country. Divorce and separation, up sharply in recent years, turn one household into two, he observed. In addition many elderly widows continue to maintain homes on their own and the postponement of marriages by young people has led meny of them to maintain smaller households `` One in 10 homeowner units is a woman living alone,'' <PERSON> Devaney </PERSON> commented. Other findings from the nealysis included: _ The median monthly housing costs for all Americans averaged $ 355 in 1985, compared to $ 311 for blacks and $ 357 for Hispanics _ The proportions of income spent for housing were 28 percent for renters, 21 percent for owners of mortgaged homes and 13 percent for folks with homes that were not mortgaged _ The average size of new homes built in 1986 was 1,825 square feet, up 300 sq feet from 20 years earlier _ The median age of housing in 1985 was 23 years

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 441 million package of education programs is as appealing as `` motherhood,'' says one Democratic supporter, but critics say it spends too little to counter the problems in American schools. The most optimistic outlook on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal came from its chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsor, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` It's a package one could hardly be against,'' she said Tuesday after a Rose Garden ceremony at which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced he was sending it to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Chances of passage are `` very good,'' said <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> the senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> education subcommittee. But there were some who found reason to grumble, among them Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., and the 1.9-million-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> awkins, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Laboee </PERSON>, called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan `` a futile response to the growing crisis in American education.'' He sno future on Capitol Hill.'' The Educational Excellence Act outlined by the president makes good on many of his campaign promises, among them a $ 250 million grant program to reward schols that have cut drug use or dropout rates, raised test scores or improved in other ways. jor part of the package, proposed for fiscal 1990, calls for spending $ 100 million on a new magchools program. Schools would be encouraged to develop special with the objective of increasing open enrollment and parental choice. Other parts of the bill would reward outstanding teaience scholars, develop new ways to certify teachers, help drug-ridden urban schools and bolster the endowments of historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges. Critics zeroed in on its fiscal modesty. `` The fact that they can talk easily about raising $ 40 billion to bail out savings and loans and we're nickel-and-diming on the issue of children's education, talking ab0 million, is ludicrous,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Melley </PERSON>, chief lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fact is, if the education budget were to just enjoy the cost of living increase that they give the defense budget, we would have had another $ 900 million,'' he said. Some juggling in the budget proposal submitted by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and later embraced by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would allow modest increases in several rams such as Chapter 1, which bolsters basic skills of disadvantaged students. But critics say even those increases do n't match inflation, aning schools would have to cut back on services. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` attempting to strip programs long supported by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pay for new initiatives of questionable value,'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> charged. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will not accept that lack of commitment to educaion investment.'' Not all Dmocrats were negative about the n. `` This is an excellent initiative,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the education subcommittee, who attended the Rose Garden announcemeo `` motherhood'' and said its chances of passage are `` pretty good.'' Eduction officials said Wednesday thd enter budget negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> seeking $ 22.3 billion in fiscal 1990 spending author for their department _ the initial $ 21.9 billion sought by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plus $ 441 million for the Budition to the $ 250 million for merit schools and $ 100 million for magnets, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing: _ $ 25 millionor grants to urban schools that have the most serious drug problems. _ $ 25 million for federal grants to develop ways to get professionals from other fields into teachingstrative positions. _ $ 10 million in matching grants to historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges and universities to herich their endowments. _ $ 7.6 million for grants to outstandng teachers. _ $ 5 million for scholarships to graduating high school students who have excelled in mathemat _ $ 18 million for three initiatives that do not require legiative action, comprising $ 13 million to expand ate local education innovations, $ 2 million for the education ofchildren and youth and $ 3 million for a literacy program for homeless adults.

<TEXT>
 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who neglected to report travel abroad paid for in part by foreign governments say they were ignorant of the federal law requiring them to do so. Rep. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, who traveled to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> with three colleagues and their spouses last November said he was `` absolutely unaware'' of the filing requirements under the 1978 Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act. He was n't alone. `` If I did n't file, it was an oversight,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agriculture subcommittee on livestock, dairy and poultry and leader of the delegation that spent 12 days in the two countries. Two of <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>'s colleagues, however, did complete the forms. The act was intended to prevent conflicts of interest by ensuring disclosure of gifts from foreign governments, including travel expenses. Other lawmakers who did n't fill out the forms also pledged to do so if congressional ethics officials deem it necessary. The officials say they have no way of knowing how many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fail to file the reports. Conviction of violating the law could carry a civil penalty of $ 5,000 plus the cost of the gift, but no member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been charged with failing to file a proper foreign travel expense report. In 1988, two senators and eight <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members filed travel expense reports under the gifts act. Among those who did n't, at least at first: _ Sens <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb.; <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, R-S.; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>; and then-Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, D-Mont They and others received transportation paid for by the governments of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> during a January 1988 congressional trip to those countries. _ Sen <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, who spent one night at an international conference in <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, last June. `` Since we never knew about it -LRB- the law -RRB-, we never filled it out,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>'s spokesman. <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> subsequently reported the travel expenses. `` I'm going to check with the appropriate <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office and if indeed it's determined that a report was not filed that should have been filed, then we'll do that,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>'s administrative assistant Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Ethics, was the lone senator on the trip to the two countries to disclose the travel expenses on a gifts and decorations act form <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON> neglected to file even though he was advised by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., that `` the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act ... requires that expenses for travel provided by a foreign government be reported to the committee within 30 days of departure from the donor country. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> enclosed a copy of the form with the advice to <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>. Overseas expenses for the <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON> delegation were paid by <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, the Australian government-owned airline, and several private, quasi-private and foreign government entities, such as the Australian Meat and <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zealand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zealand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yolles </PERSON>, an attorney with <ORGANIZATION> Clifford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON>, the firm that helped arrange the trip to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, said no foreign government money was used in the trip. But House rules say funding by `` quasi-governmental'' organizations must be listed. The Institute for <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit research organization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, paid <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s travel expenses but did n't tell him the East Germans were picking up expenses in the country, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gest </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` If we should have filled one out, we will,'' <PERSON> Gest </PERSON> said. `` It's often not clear in situations like this,'' she said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s office planned to check to see if his expenses exceeded the $ 100 that triggers the filing requirement for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minimum is $ 180. Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bereuter </PERSON>, R-Neb., who also attended the conference, did file a gift form, estimating the value of lodging and meals for three days at the <ORGANIZATION> Interhotel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION> at $ 400 To ensure that senators are aware of the law, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee sent all members a copy of it, plus an explanation, in a letter last November. In some cases, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or their aides apparently filled out the forms unnecessarily. `` The confusion indicates to me ... it's not being enforced,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wruble </PERSON>, a private attorney who formerly headed the Office of Government Ethics. But he said public officials have an `` inescapable responsibility'' to know who is providing them with something of significant value.

 Only rarely in this avowedly Marxist state does anyone decide to run for office on a platform of free enterprise, free expression and free emigration. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahamonde </PERSON> did. He lost. The margin against <PERSON> Bahamonde </PERSON> was 2-1 but what makes him unique was that he even tried. The place where <PERSON> Bahamonde </PERSON>, 53, made a bit of history the other night was near his home in a rundown section of eastern <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> called <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Padron </PERSON>. The 150 voters in that municipality had before them a classic political choice: a Marxist-Leninst against what might be described as an American-style liberal Democrat. This was a highly unusual occurrence in a country where Mar orthodoxy is the national religion. What happened the night of March 21 provided some ins how, after 30 years, Communist authorities have been skillfully able to keep the Bahamondes of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> at bay. rters of the revolution see it, opening the dooruld lead to the unraveling of when <PERSON> Bahamonde </PERSON> regards as the substantial gains made under President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, particularly in social servic He wants to preserve those advances and add what he believes <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> lacks most: freedom.

Here, he has been able to work, raise three children, se son graduate from college and, with notable exceptions that have left him understandably embitered, lead a reasonably stable existence. believes <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> needs change. Almost all critics of the syste, suffered imprisonment because they trespasseds or simply opted for silence. Almost nobody chooses to trto change things through the electoral process. <PERSON> Bahamonde </PERSON>, an agricultural engineer, is an exction. He has a number of gripes about the sallowed to be self-employed, that press censorship should end a with food rationing and that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> should allow es to compete with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The points he wanted to make that Tuesday night in March when he joined his neighbors for an elect state assembly seat. On March 21, the Comrge of the proceedings refused <PERSON> Bahamonde </PERSON> permission to read his platform. The party stalwart st, according to standard procedures, voters are permitted to spavor or against the candidates once the nominating process is completed. The candidates themselves can not campaign. The establishment candidate was <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldama </PERSON>, a decorated 26-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miniry </ORGANIZATION> who served in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. In a country that honors citizens who sacrifice themselves for the revolution, <PERSON> Aldama </PERSON> is a man of distinction. During a sometimes tense period in which <PERSON> Bahamonde </PERSON>'s credentials were discussed that evening, he found his controversial past resurrected. d, after all, written a letter to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in 1971 calling for a shift to material incentives for workers insteadrds _ meaning low pay. He also ran afoul of the police in 1proselytyzing _ trying to convince fellow workers that the systeded fundamental change. There also were allegations that he tried to leave the country during the Mariel980 and that he even had made an attempt on <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s life. ahamonde rejects the latter allegations. He has a letter from avernment official proving he never sought to emigrate. Stilrt 10 days after that issue was raised, he recalon. `` I responded that this was false,'' he said `` I never had any intention of abandoningmy country.'' The darkest pfor <PERSON> Bahamonde </PERSON> occurred in May 1975 when he was detained for supposedly attempting to spread his anti-communistws. He was subjected, he cld, to eight electric shock treatments on grounds that he was suffering from menurbances. If he has any such problem, it is not evident to the casual observer. He projects a rational image. `` It took me a long time to recover, years,'' he said, referring to the impact of the shock treatment. `` You lose your memory. You ca n't even remember people's names. I thought I would even foget what I learned in the university.'' Alld, he was detained 10 months after his arrest in1975. He was held 19 days in 1971 and another 583. These problems dogged him last month when he launched his candidacy. People wondered: Can anyone who has been in trouble with the law be counted on to fulfill his duties in elective office? Whthe votes were counted, the answer was obviouslyThere were 60 votes for <PERSON> Aldama </PERSON>, 31 for Bahamondd 59 abstensions. But <PERSON> Bahamonde </PERSON> felt vindicated. Those who abstained, he argued, actually were his supportrs but were afraid to take a public stand in th-of-hands vote. In a secret ballot, <PERSON> Bahamonde </PERSON> claims he would have won hands down.

 Rep. <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> visiting <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s president last September when the African leader suggested <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON> travel to <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> personally to investigate a human rights matter on which members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had expressed criticism. `` I said I did n't have any way to get there, and he said, ` Why do n't you take <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>,''' <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, D-Calif., said in an interview So the government of Zairean President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> picked up the tab for <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>'s two-day trip from <LOCATION> Nice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, via <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON> was one of eight <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and two senators who reported receiving travel expenses from foreign governments in 1988.

<HEAD>First Lady Kicks Off Anti-Child Abuse Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Small things such as being a good neighbor can make a difference in preventing child abuse, first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in kicking off a national campaign to end abuse. `` It's not enough to just feel, and when we hear of a child who's been seriously injured or even killed, to be sad. That's not enough. Then it's too late,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday at a news conference kicking off the sixth annual National Child Abuse Prevention Month. `` The time to get involved is before the blow lands.'' `` Sometimes it's as simple as being a good neighbor, listening to a young mother talk over a cup of coffee or, even better, offering to take the children for an hour or two,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led off a list of celebrity speakers, including <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Efrem </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimbalist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, an actor who said he spoke as an `` adult survivor'' of abuse.

<NOTE>No Hospitals Will be Closed, Secretary Says</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Veterans Affairs Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> says the new department does n't plan to close any of its hospitals but may change some of their assignments. All 172 veterans' hospitals `` can not be all-purpose entities,'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. `` Logically, there has to be a degree of specialization,'' he said. Veterans' hospitals already have scores of agreements for using military hospitals and vice versa, and <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said he hopes to expand those. He did not directly answer when asked what he thought of merging the veterans' and military hospital systems. `` We have, if anything, a shortage of facilities,'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said. He and other officials have said they expect that as the nation's 27 million veterans age, many will retire to the <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION>, putting pressure on veterans' facilities in those states. `` We have no intention whatsoever of closing any veterans' medical facilities,'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says 10 states will share in a $ 2 million test program that will let low-income families spend government coupons at farmers' markets. Participants must already be in the government's <ORGANIZATION> WIC </ORGANIZATION> program, which provides special supplemental food for women, infants and children.

 Psychologists are consulting with nationally recognized experts on disasters and tragedies to help residents young and old cope with the nation's worst oil spill. `` The stress down there in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> is incredible,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` People need to be aware the stress is going to be affecting them. They need to be aware that their stress is going to impact on their children.'' A 24-hour toll-free telephone line staffed by mental health professionals to take calls from the distressed is being set up, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> set up a similar line for its employees in the aftermath of the space shuttle Challenger disaster. Among the most common feelings are hopelessness, helplessness and worthlessness, he said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> has been consulting with <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a psychologist at the Univerity of <LOCATION> Maryland-Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> known to police, fire and medical services around the country as the founder of a process known as critical incident stress debriefing. The process is designed to relieve the stress emergency service personnel encounter in mass-casualty incidents and other crises. A variation of the process may be valuable to the Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> communities devastated by the spill, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> has done similar work in other afflicted communities, like <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, after a gunman shot up a shopping mall, killing six people and wounding 10. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> warned that the children in the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> area would be among the first to show the stress. `` He said do n't be surprised if children ask for cooking oil to put in the bathtub, or out in the mud puddle,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> psychologist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gist </PERSON>, a leading disaster expert, was scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> today, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, state coordinator of emergency services. `` Mental health -LRB- professionals -RRB- should plan on seeing problems ... for two to three years at least,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` Probably longer because of the total loss of lifestyle that may occur. The loss of lifestyle is as important as loss of income.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> suggested to <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> that the effects on employment be evaluated as quickly as possible. `` Those that will lose their livelihood for the next year or two will need vocational rehablitation, or it soon will have a negative impact on their mental health,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. In the interim, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said, the emphasis will be on education, trying to describe the reactions that are normal in such a situation and offering ways to deal with them.

 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government declared a cease-fire in its war against the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas for <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, the Islamic holy month of fasting. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said the unilateral cease-fire would begin at midnight today. If the rebels refused to observe the sanctity of the fasting month, he said, government troops would retaliate. It was at least the fourth cease-fire declared by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> since January 1987. The first truce was disregarded by both sides, and the guerrillas ignored all subsequent calls. The latest cease-fire was broadcast Wednesday by the official <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, guerrilla rockets slammed into downtown Kqabul, killing six people and wounding 23, a government official said on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> Radio said 10 people were killed and 39 wounded. On Tuesday, at least six people were killed and eight wounded by rockets that hit residential neighborhoods. Meanwhile, a special security court convicted two Pakistanis of spying. Sgt. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> was sentenced Wednesday to 18 years imprisonment and Cpl. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Afzal </PERSON> was sentenced to 16 years. <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Afzal </PERSON>, 25, confessed to spying for Pakistani intelligence agencies. Judge <PERSON> Obaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakhi </PERSON> said they could have been sentenced to death but he and the other two judges hearing the case had acceded to their requests for leniency. <PERSON> Sakhi </PERSON> said the sentences could be appealed. <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Afzal </PERSON> said they worked for Pakistani intelligence agencies and were `` forcibly sent'' to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by their superior officers. <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> said he received a $ 1,000 bonus, while <PERSON> Afzal </PERSON> said he was promised $ 200 upon his return. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has regularly denied sending any nationals into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official questioned Wednesday whether the pair were Pakistanis, saying no proof of their identity had been supplied to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s mission in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. The Afghan government said the men were captured March 10 in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> province, which borders <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Most of the Afghan guerrillas are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. They have received support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and other countries in their decade-old war against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s protege government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> ended its nine-year involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> Feb. 15, but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is still supplying the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government. The rocket attacks on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> Tuesday and Wednesday were the biggest attacks on the capital since March 14, when at least five rockets hit the airport, injuring two people. Wednesday's rockets spewed shrapnel and debris as they hit a small park next to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> Hotel and a commercial district several blocks away. The rockets, which landed four to 10 blocks from the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, were fired before noon, when sidewalks and marketplaces are crowded with pedestrians.

 Lawmakers have agreed to let <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces continue joint training exercises with Honduran troops in this Central American country that borders <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. In a separate action, the legislature also approved new measures for cooperating with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to fight drug trafficking. The military exercises agreement was approved by a 132-2 vote on Wednesday. The lawmakers who voted no said the measure could hurt regional peace efforts. The two countries have engaged in more than 80 joint military training exercises involving at least 60,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and 20,000 Honduran troops during the past 38 years. The exercises were stepped up in 1982 when relations between <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and the leftist Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> deteriorated and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> built an air base in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> also has served as a refuge, training ground and staging base for Nicaraguan rebels, about 11,000 of whom have lived with their families in camps near the Nicaraguan border since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government cut off military aid to them in February 1988. An estimated 1,100 American troops currently are stationed at the <ORGANIZATION> Enrique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, about 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. The base is considered among the most important centers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operations in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been supporting the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in its nine-year war against leftist rebels. Under the drug agreement, Honduran officials said they will work with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to crack down on drug production and trafficking. Both nations are to share information and human and technological resources. During the past six years, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast has become a transfer point for drug shipments from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the most-publicized local case, reputed drug baron <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> returned home to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in 1986 after escaping from a Colombian prison. His arrest in April 1988 at his home in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> and rapid deportation to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> touched off riots. Extradition of Hondurans is prohibited by the constitution. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> remains jailed at the federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, serving a three-year sentence for escaping from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prison in 1971.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall; Dollar Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s main index plunged today, ending seven days of gains, while the dollar rose substantially against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which rose 48.54 points to a record high on Wednesday, shed 365.01 points, or 1.1 percent, to finish trading at 32,995.78. It was the index's second-largest decline this year, following a 366.21-point drop on March 20, when it finished at 31,654.80. Stocks fell almost across the board as participants expressed concern about the recent rapid rise in the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index, which had gained more than 1,800 points since last Tuesday, said a dealer with a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Uncertainty over possible political instability caused by a widening stock-profiteering scandal also discouraged participants, the dealer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The scandal has been continuing for some time, but speculators are very concerned now about the situation,'' he said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, whose party is under fire for its links to <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the information services conglomerate at the center of the scandal, suffered a major blow Wednesday with reports he had received $ 380,000 from the firm at fund-raising parties in May 1987. In the scandal, the company reportedly sold hundreds of thousands of unlisted shares of a real-estate subsidiary at discount prices to about 150 influential public and business figures. The recipients of the shares made substantial profits after over-the-counter trading began and the stocks quickly rose in value. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s public support ratings have plunged to about 10 percent and he now faces strong pressure from the political opposition to resign. `` Investors' second-largest concern is inflation, which made them either step off to the sidelines or sell issues because of the upcoming release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate,'' the dealer said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobless rate for March is to be announced Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Inflation and subsequent interest rate hikes to slow the economy could discourage stock investment. Trading was active, with volume on the first section estimated at 1.1 billion shares, down from Wednesday's 1.8 billion shares. On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 132.15 yen, up 0.78 yen from Wednesday's 131.37-yen finish. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency started trading at 131.93 yen and ranged between 131.75 and 132.25 yen. A trader with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said the dollar-yen exchange rate changed little during the day as investors stayed on the sidelines trying to avoid major moves ahead of the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate. `` Basically, the market has more demand for the dollar than the yen, mainly because of the higher interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said the trader, speaking on condition of anonymity. For currency investors, higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates make the dollar more attractive than the yen.

<TEXT>
 Two men trudged for six hours through snow-covered forest to get help for three injured people after a small plane crashed into a mountain in northern <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, killing the pilot, authorities said. Searchers used snowmobiles to rescue the three who had remained with the wrecked aircraft, witnesses said. `` As far as I'm concerned we had no choice but to press on because we would have died if we did n't,'' said <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rancourt </PERSON>, who hiked more than six miles through thick woods to alert authorities. Killed in the crash was pilot <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Paquet </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> provincial police Sgt. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Viau </PERSON>. The aircraft, carrying the pilot and five passengers, all from <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, struck a mountain Tuesday morning in the <LOCATION> Gaspe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, authorities said. <PERSON> Rancourt </PERSON>, 36, and <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, 43, said they pulled the three injured passengers from the wrecked aircraft, made a fire and then decided to walk for help at about 3 p.m. Tuesday, according to Canadian Press. After walking for six hours, they came to a house that happened to be the home of <PERSON> Carleton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> of <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>. Authorities were alerted and rescue crews, using snowmobiles, found the other survivors early Wednesday and took them to a hospital. Dr. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Matton </PERSON>, medical director of <ORGANIZATION> Baie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chaleurs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thibault </PERSON>, 35, was seriously injured in the crash and was in stable condition. The other two passengers, <PERSON> Francine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lelievre </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremblay </PERSON>, 35, were hospitalized for observation.

 Mob boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> `` Little Nicky'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and seven associates could become the nation's first Mafia members to get the death penalty after being convicted of killing another gangster, authorities said. A jury deliberated about three hours Wednesday before returning guilty verdicts on murder, conspiracy and a weapons violation in the 1985 slaying of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> `` Frankie Flowers'' <PERSON> D'Alfonso </PERSON>, who failed to show Scarfo proper respect. The conviction gave the 60-year-old <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and his co-defendants the prospect of execution or spending the rest of their lives in prison. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Phildadelphia-Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION>, is already serving a 14-year sentence in a $ 1 million extortion case and faces at least 40 more years in a federal racketeering case. Common Pleas Court Jury members had said they could return the death penalty if necessary. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said he would seek that sentence on grounds the murder was deliberate and premeditated. The jury was to begin hearing testimony in the penalty phase this afternoon. No other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mafia member has been sentenced to death, organized crime investigators say. One mobster, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> `` Lepke'' <PERSON> Buchalter </PERSON>, was executed in the 1940s, but he led <ORGANIZATION> Murder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a group of mercenary hit men, not an Italian Mafia family. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s lawyer, expressed concern about the penalty phase in light of the jury's quick verdict. `` I do n't think I'm going to get much sympathy from a jury that did n't even want to deliberate a case that affects the lives of eight people,'' <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> said. The defense lawyers said that they would file appeals within 30 days. The prosecution's case focused on two informants. One, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> DelGiorno </PERSON>, has testified against <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> several times in the past two years. He received a 20-year sentence for his role in the <PERSON> D'Alfonso </PERSON> killing and other convictions. The second, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Milano </PERSON>, was scheduled to stand trial with the others but decided to cooperate to avoid a death sentence, even though it meant tesitifying against his 27-year-old brother, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> `` Nicky Whip.'' <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Milano </PERSON> pleaded guilty to third-degree murder. The defense attorneys branded the informants as liars. Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Santaguida </PERSON>, who represented 31-year-old defendant <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Narducci </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said the jury `` just could n't have examined the credibility of the witnesses so quickly, but obviously they believed them.'' After the jury foreman announced the first verdict, for <PERSON> Narducci </PERSON>, <PERSON> Narducci </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>, ran screaming from the courtroom. `` Stop it! Stop it! You should all die!'' <PERSON> Narducci </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON>, yelled at the jury. `` Like my father died!'' <PERSON> D'Alfonso </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Gina </PERSON>, shouted back. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> still faces charges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> the Blade'' <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> in the 1978 slaying of <ORGANIZATION> Somers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helfant </PERSON>. Besides <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Narducci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Milano </PERSON>, the others convicted were <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligambi </PERSON>, 48, and <PERSON> Narducci </PERSON>'s 26-year-old brother, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, who were identified as the shooters; <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> `` Faffy'' Iannarella, 32, accused of supplying the two murder guns; <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> `` Chuckie'' <PERSON> Merlino </PERSON>, 47, and his brother <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> `` Yogi'' <PERSON> Merlino </PERSON>, 32. During the trial, which began March 17, the two informants testified <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> gave the order to kill <PERSON> D'Alfonso </PERSON> because he lacked respect and refused to share profits from illegal operations with the mob. <PERSON> D'Alfonso </PERSON> was shot on a south <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> street near his home.

<TEXT>
 Mayor-elect <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s promise that the doors of his office would remain open to blacks was greeted with guarded optimism by many of the political leaders who lost control of City Hall. The promise highlighted <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s Tuesday night victory speech. A day later, acting Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> told reporters, `` You heard him say it. We'll make sure he sticks to it.'' Also helping hold <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> to his word, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said, is the practical matter of having to face re-election in 1991. `` I'm sure he'll be extremely careful. They've got a short time. You've got to have continuity in government. You ca n't just go in there and clean out all the blacks,'' said <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who is black. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s victory over chief rival <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, the lone black in Tuesday's election, earned him the right to complete the final two years of the late <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s second term. And <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> invoked the memory of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as well as his political boss-father, the late <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, in promising that `` The City That Works'' will work first to unite an electorate deeply divided along racial lines. `` The openness and fairness that the late Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> talked about will be in my administration in the city of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, whose victory ended six years of black political control in the nation's third-largest city. `` A mayor today has to bring people together from one end of this city to the other,'' he added, `` to accomplish the things that are necessary to give people a good quality of life.'' During a round of interviews, the 46-year-old <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said he planned to leave soon for a brief vacation and would make few moves until his transition team completed its report. His inauguration is set for April 24 _ his 47th birthday. But before rushing off to attend to business that has stacked up in his state's attorney's office during the four-month campaign, he proposed several programs reminiscent of the shirt-sleeve professionalism that earned <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, in his father's days, the moniker of `` The City That Works.'' `` I will bring out the best of my father _ he knew city government,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. `` He knew state and federal government. He loved this city and worked very hard for this city and I'll try to be like him.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' most prominent supporter, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, called for party unity and for blacks to move beyond the rivalry between <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` The basic <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> coalition has remained a bit too divided and when we unite we will win,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, pointing out, `` there are only 18 months before the next election.'' Unofficial totals showed <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> finishing with 55 percent of the vote, to 43 percent for <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and 3 percent for Republican <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> was helped to victory Tuesday by overwhelming white support, low black turnout, and clear majorities among liberal, lakefront voters and Hispanics.

<TEXT>
 Ah, spring, with its warming breezes, budding trees and luscious smell of skunk spray! <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> planned a day of traveling for her antique business Wednesday and if luck was with her, there'd be a dead skunk by the side of the road. Unfortunate for the skunk, of course, but what a wonderful smell. `` There's nothing like it in the world,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, who does n't want her last name known by people who might think there's something weird about her In her 50 years, the suburban woman has had to endure the solitary pleasure of reveling in the odor of skunk while getting the fisheye from her husband, children, other relatives and friends. She wondered: Was there anyone else like her out there? In January, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> ran an ad in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today's personal column: `` Calling All Skunk Lovers. `` My family and friends think I am the only person in the world that likes the skunk scent. I would like to prove them wrong, so if you or anyone you know likes the scent, please reply.'' One response came from a woman in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> who apparently did n't read the personal ad very carefully, since she offered <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> a job in her brothel But the 70 other letters were from people like <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>. `` My husband said I must be the only one in the world because God could n't possibly have made anyone like me since the smell is a defense mechanism,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>. Ha! How wrong her husband can be. Listen to this letter from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>: `` I can think of no combination of things using the five senses that can rival ... the feel of a warm summer breeze, the taste of a cool drink, the sights of a beautiful garden, the sound of rushing water, and the faint smell of skunk.'' Another writer said he never tries to hit a live skunk when he's driving, `` but if a skunk lay dead, I might try to get a little on the wheel. Other writers called the musky scent `` sensuous'' and `` intriguingly delicate.'' And what about this exclamation point-filled letter from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>: `` I've fed skunks before in Yosemite National Park! I once dated a woman in 1980 who owned four skunks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. We walked them in the parks on long leashes, and they love to have their heads scratched! Feel welcome to write me anytime! I'm 36, Italian, 5 ft. 10 _ 190 pds. brown eyes and wavy hair! I love a skunks scent! Write back!'' Actually, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> presents a puzzle. `` Recently I've had the chance to wiff the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> skunk,'' wrote a transplanted Southerner, `` and I can tell you truthfully it did n't do a thing for me.'' <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> said she lived for 12 years in a semidesert area of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and never had the pleasure even once of getting skunk scent. Otherwise, the 30,000 miles <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> and her husband travel yearly in their antiques business have revealed no favorite stretches of road for catching the odor, no sections of the country that produce superior scents. `` It's all just wonderful,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 A 12-year-old girl who told police she was overwhelmed by her baby-sitting duties will be tried as an adult in the strangling of her 2-year-old brother and choking of her 15-month-old sister. A <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury indicted fifth-grader <PERSON> Arva </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON> as an adult on charges of second-degree murder and aggravated child abuse. The grand jury could have sent the case to juvenile court. Her lawyer said <PERSON> Arva </PERSON>'s age and the fact that she had no history of violent behavior and no criminal record should have supported a juvenile charge. `` We're disappointed and shocked that the grand jury decided to indict her,'' said attorney <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` There was little if any evidence put on to support trying her as an adult.'' Investigators were initially baffled when <PERSON> Arva </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>, woke up the morning of March 14 and found <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> dead and his sister, <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>, injured at their home in nearby <LOCATION> Wilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manors </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arva </PERSON>, who was 11 years old at the time, was taken into custody when it was determined that <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> had been strangled. Police said the child confessed to the attack and said she was overwhelmed by the responsibility of watching her half brother and half sister from when she got home from school until 11 at night. Her mother worked two jobs to support the family. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> is hospitalized in critical condition at Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Doctors say she could be permanently disabled. <PERSON> Arva </PERSON> remained at the county's <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday night and was to be transferred today to the <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> said he would ask the court to let her remain in the custody of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` Society would not benefit by placing her among adults,'' <PERSON> McCray </PERSON> said. No charges have been filed against Ms. <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said she is being investigated by Health and <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> officials for possible neglect charges.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s `` secret speech'' denouncing dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was published for the first time in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today, 33 years after it sent shock waves through the Soviet bloc, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s speech to a closed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congress in 1956 put an abrupt end to three decades of official glorification of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, a period during which complaints about his regime often met with prison or death. The text appears in the monthly News from the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency said. Copies of the journal were being mailed exclusively to its 650,000 subscribers, a staff member of the journal said. Citizens who do not already subscribe will not be able to buy a copy, the staffer said. All subscription copies were en route to the post office today. Copies of the speech were leaked to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and published just days after <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> disclosed that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> had used torture, arrests and fabricated charges to purge the leading ranks of the Communist Party. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who was toppled from power in 1964, did not tell the entire story of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s bloody crimes. He omitted the dictator's war against the peasants through forced collectivization and ignored his own role during the reign of terror <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> ruled the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from 1924 until his death in 1953. Prominent Soviets have called for the publication of the speech in their own land for years. Top members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> heard summaries of the speech read at meetings after the congress, but for the Soviet public at large, it has remained a mystery. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> freed many people imprisoned under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and pulled back from other repressive measures, but the `` de-Stalinization'' stopped after he left office. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has resumed the process, and discussion of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repressions now is widespread. The same journal in February printed another so-called `` secret speech,'' that of former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. In remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in October 1987, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was being glorified and that the Soviet people had gained virtually nothing from the Soviet leader's reforms. The speech led to <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s ouster as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss and removal from the ruling Politburo.

 Many Cuban exile leaders interpret this week's meeting between <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as evidence of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s growing political isolation <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s support for `` glasnost'' during his Cuban visit, and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s speech refusing to endorse his guest's political liberalization program, left <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s many exiles gloating. `` I think it was a suicidal speech _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is the one that pays for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and keeps the economy running,'' said <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON>, news director of the Spanish-language radio station <ORGANIZATION> WQBA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have to say that <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is too old to change his ways, but now the world now is changing.

Some hoped that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s pressure may do what the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 failed to accomplish, and finally bring to an end the fantasy many exiles still nurture of returning to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to overthrow <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. `` It's very difficult for me to imagine a counterrevolution,'' said <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortina </PERSON>, an administrator at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I ca n't see the veterans in their 40s and 50s, full of cholesterol and good living, climbing over the seawall'' into <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>.

Others, however, fear that at least in the short run, human rights may be a victim of the ideological rift, rather than its beneficiary. They note that even as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> bid farewell to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government began rounding up known dissidents. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> `` can not afford an easing of controls over the population,'' said <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreira </PERSON>, a director of the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` The only way he can stay in power is by keeping the police state full blast.''

<HEAD>Skinner: Collapsed Bridge Not Among Worst</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The bridge that collapsed and sent eight people to their deaths was in better shape than many of the aging bridges nationwide, said <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> went to the site of the bridge collapse on Wednesday. Four cars and a tractor-trailer plunged into the <LOCATION> Hatchie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> when a section of the 55-year-old bridge collapsed Saturday 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. `` There are bridges that are in more need of repair than this one,'' said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> during his visit. Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., who accompanied <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, said more than 200,000 of the 575,000 bridges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are classified as deficient Those weaknesses, <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said, range `` from minor deficiencies to major deficiencies that could lead to tragedies similar to the one we see here.'' The collapse left a gaping hole in the two northbound lanes of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 51, but a newer companion bridge for two southbound lanes was undamaged. The southbound bridge was closed for inspection but was expected to reopen for two-way traffic today or Friday. Authorities say spring floods may have undercut a bridge support, but the cause of the collapse has not been determined. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he will press for a national policy on repairing highway and railroad bridges. `` We're going to put a program together and we're going to try to find a way to fund it,'' the secretary said. Repairing the bridges known to be in immediate need could cost upwards of $ 70 billion, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. Even though thousands of bridges are in bad shape, bridge inspections generally are sufficient, in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> as well as other states, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. The Hatchie bridge passed inspection in 1987 and was due for another one in about six months. `` That bridge ... is not anywhere close to the bottom of bridges in this country,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Who Led Fight Against Adams' Release Is Fired</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The prosecutor who tried to keep a man imprisoned after his conviction in a police killing was overturned has been fired. His boss cited policy conflicts for the dismissal. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> is the third prosector involved in the case of <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> to leave the office this week. `` I found we had a conflict regarding current office policies that simply could not be resolved any other way,'' said <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>. He would not elaborate on Wednesday's firing. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> did not return repeated calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Other officials at the office declined comment. Over <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s objections, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was released from a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prison March 22, less than a month after a state court overturned his conviction for the 1976 slaying of a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> spent more than 12 years in prison. His case was chronicled in the documentary `` The Thin Blue Line,'' in which a key prosecution witness recanted his testimony that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was the triggerman. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s actions were deplorable but added that he was being made a scapegoat for following the office's `` marching orders. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who served as assistant district attorny in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for 21 years, participated in the original prosecution of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and helped choose a jury for the 1977 trial. In fighting <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' release, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said state District Court Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> and eight of the nine appellate judges were `` liberal'' and biased in <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' favor. He asked that <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> be removed from the case. The day after <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' release, <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said there was n't enough credible evidence to retry him, and the murder charge was dropped. At the time, <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said he would investigate <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s behavior as a personnel matter. Earlier this week, prosecutors <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Creuzot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> left, saying they were going into private practice.

<TEXT>
 The pilot of a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet that slid off an icy runway into <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in 1982 said a jury award of more than $ 1 million justified his seven years of `` trauma and heartache.'' Pilot <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> and co-pilot <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertzfeldt </PERSON> had suffered `` emotional distress, impairment of earning capacity, lost wages and minor physical injuries'' from the January 1982 crash, said their attorney, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. A federal jury Wednesday awarded <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> $ 1,021,840 and <PERSON> Hertzfeldt </PERSON> $ 444,700. <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which operates <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, does not believe the evidence supports the verdict and plans to ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> to set the award aside next week, said agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAlpine </PERSON>. By law, the pilot and co-pilot can not seek damages against the federal government. A separate federal jury earlier this year determined that the crash was caused by icy runway conditions at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> and that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the port authority had failed to apprise <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> of the situation. Yet another federal jury awarded the airline more than $ 30 million for the loss of the jet. <PERSON> Langley </PERSON>, 64, said the decision was `` justification for one's position over the last seven years and the trauma and all the heartache that's been going on In retrospect, I'd rather that it had n't happened. Now that it has, I think it is a fair judgment.'' `` I think the last 30 seconds on the runway are something that I'm going to live with the rest of my life,'' he said. `` For a pilot to feel he's not fully in control of his airplane is a most frightening experience.'' <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said he lost confidence and interest in flying after the crash and gave up his plans to become a flight engineer after he reached the mandatory retirement age of 60. <PERSON> Hertzfeldt </PERSON> is working as a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> shuttle co-pilot, which <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said was the only job he could get with a crash on his record. <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said he mentioned the tarmac seemed slippery when the jet touched down. `` Then a few seconds later I said ` No braking' to the crew,''' <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said. As the end of the runway approached he saw the landing lights and pilings of a light tower that jutted out into <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said he was `` literally standing on the brakes, with the engines in full reverse thrust.'' When the DC-10 stopped, the front end was in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and the nose, which had broken off, was partially submerged. The crew had to swim to safety, and two people sitting in the front seats were never found and presumably drowned.

 <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> has broken diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and given Libyans until Friday to leave the country, Radio <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> announced. The state-controlled radio said the tiny, land-locked central <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> nation also has recalled its diplomats from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which early this year granted asylum to ousted <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jean-Batiste </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON>. `` The decision was reached because of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s involvement in activities which undermine our security ...,'' state-owned radio quoted Foreign Minister <PERSON> Cyprian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbonimpa </PERSON> as saying. `` In recent days, Libyan diplomats are turning out in a destabilizing campaign, which has seriously compromised peace and unity in our country,'' the radio said without elaboration. The broadcast, monitored Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Kampala </LOCATION>, said the decision to break ties with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was reached by the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commitee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> in an emergency meeting Wednesday.

 The new spiritual leader of Moslems in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> _ whose predecessor was slain in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>' main mosque _ has received death threats, police said today. `` We are taking this very seriously,'' a police official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the threats that Imam <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahdi </PERSON> received over the telephone apparently stemmed from his moderate views. The previous imam, <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahdal </PERSON>, was killed along with his librarian after <PERSON> Ahdal </PERSON> failed to support the death sentence <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> issued Feb. 14 against author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for his novel `` The Satanic Verses,'' which some claim insults Islam. <PERSON> Ahdal </PERSON> also had received threats. Like Ahdal, <PERSON> Rahdi </PERSON> is a Saudi national. <PERSON> Ahdal </PERSON> also was a former student of <PERSON> Rahdi </PERSON>'s. `` It is somewhat logical that there are new threats since he has the same views as his predecessor,'' the police official said. The official would not specify when the threats were made. But Belgian newspapers reported they were made in calls on Saturday and Tuesday. On Friday, a pro-Iran fundamentalist group in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> claimed responsibility for the murders. The group, <ORGANIZATION> Soldiers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, said it carried out `` God's verdict'' by killing the imam and his librarian, <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Behir </PERSON>. Both were shot in the head and neck from close range. Security around <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>' main mosque was increased after the latest threats, police said.

 An 81-year-old widow who chased an intruder from her back door by firing at him twice with a revolver says she fears for her safety and wants police to return her gun. Police said Wednesday that <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> heard a noise on her porch Monday night, called police, and then went to investigate. As she opened the door, the stranger forced it open and pushed her backward. Mrs. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> retreated to her bedroom and retrieved the <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> five-shot revolver from under her pillow. She told police that when the gunman advanced, she aimed at the floor and fired the gun to frighten him. She said she fired a second shot as he headed out the back door, nicking the corner of the door frame, said Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlowski </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said the intruder stopped in the backyard, turned toward her, and asked her how many bullets she had left. Police then arrived and the intruder fled on foot, <PERSON> Orlowski </PERSON> said. `` When the officers came in, she was still holding the weapon with two spent rounds and three live rounds in it,'' <PERSON> Orlowski </PERSON> said. `` They took the gun from her.'' Police said they believe the gun is unregistered. If it turns out to be a legal weapon, they'll return it to her and if not, they may allow her to register it, police said. Mrs. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> says she needs her gun back for protection. `` What could I have done if I did n't have it? You can see what could happen. I want my gun back,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. She has lived in the inner-city neighborhood since 1952, and said the gun belonged to her husband, who died in 1979. Mrs. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said she thought she hit the intruder with one shot. Police found no blood at the scene, but were investigating whether a man treated at a hospital early Tuesday could have been the suspect.

 The form filled out by police when booking suspects includes a question about whether the arrested person is homosexual, a newspaper reported today.

<HEAD>Ambassador Says Nepal Facing Shortages Of Food, Medicine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> says her country has been facing severe shortages of food and medicine since two treaties with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> expired last month, a newspaper reported today. `` As of March 23, not a pin has moved into <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> except one truck of rotten oranges and onions,'' Ambassador <PERSON> Bhinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statesman </ORGANIZATION>, an English-language newspaper based in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> closed 13 of its 15 customs checkpoints along the 1,090-mile border with the Himalayan kingdom after the trade and transit treaties expired March 23. Most of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s foreign trade is with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> or conducted through <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. After the treaties expired, the supply of essential items such as medicine, fuel and baby food stopped, Mrs. <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> said. `` We are flying in medicines from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>,'' she told the newspaper in an interview Wednesday. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to hold talks either in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> or in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> to complete drafts of new treaties. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has yet to respond. Mrs. <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> said the two countries signed and approved a draft treaty on Oct. 12, 1988. But <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> abrogated the draft on March 1 and told <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> the trade and transit arrangement would lapse, she said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has insisted on a unified trade and transit treaty, which Mrs. <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> said was `` a regressive step since transit is a recognized right of access to sea of landlocked countries, a right which has also been recongnized by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>,'' she was quoted as saying. The two countries have maintained friendly ties for decades, but <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became increasingly concerned about <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> fought a border war in 1962 and since then their relations have remained uneasy. In August, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> bought unspecified Chinese arms for its 30,000-man armed forces. In the interview, Mrs. <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> said the arms acquisition was purely for the internal security of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, to guard against possible terrorist attacks. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, locked between <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, has to maintain good relations with both, and there is `` no question of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> having improved relations with any country at the cost of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>,'' the Statesman quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> as saying.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> today called the agreement with authorities to legalize Solidarity a victory, but he said the nation must work hard to take advantage of the chance the pact offers. Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said the free trade union movement, banned for seven years, could be formally registered in court within two weeks. The agreement allows Solidarity to organize. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the leader of Solidarity, and the interior minister, Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, approved the agreement Wednesday. It reinstates Solidarity and will give <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> its first free elections since the postwar communist takeover. The current one-house parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, meets Friday to enact the agreements into law. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> that Solidarity must now organize the nation's provincial governors and city mayors. He said the agreement was a political victory, `` a theoretical one which may turn out to be a victory or a disaster if we are not able to make use of it.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appeared unconcerned by the lack of reaction by Poles to the restoration of the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union, which claimed 10 million members and ignited that nation's spirit during its 16-month legal existence in 1980-81. He said he expected Solidarity to attract 5 million to 7 million members. He said he would like to see at least three competing trade unions. The agreement, under which the union is to work with authorities to revive <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s crumbling economy, came after two months of intensive talks. The pact also reinstates independent student, farmer and artistic organizations banned with Solidarity after a December 1981 military crackdown. Under the accords, free elections are to be held in June for a parliament that communist authorities will still control but in which the opposition will have strong representation. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> today, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported only that the talks had ended and that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had participated in them. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s English-language service reported on the legalization of trade unions and establishment of a two-chamber parliament but made no mention of the free elections. A series of strikes last spring and summer and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s crippled economy prompted authorities to agree to the talks that produced the accords <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> signed Wednesday. The talks involved 57 participants representing the opposition, the government and the Roman Catholic church. The Solidarity-led opposition agreed to participate in June elections to the 460-member lower house of parliament, or Sejm, that guarantee the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies a 65 percent majority. But a new house of parliament, a 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would be the first freely elected legislative body in the Soviet bloc and would have veto power over the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>. Any citizen who collects 3,000 signatures can run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and all seats would be openly contested. A presidency also would be created, to be elected jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The president would be elected this year to a six-year term and would have broad powers to dissolve parliament and veto laws. The post is expected to go to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. Communist officials hope the broad agreement will provide <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with political and labor stability so economic reforms can work to fight high inflation, constant consumer shortages and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 39 billion foreign debt.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> plans to sign into law a measure requiring all motorcycle riders to wear helmets, his spokesman said. `` The governor believes the evidence is overwhelming that motorcycle helmets are in the public interest and will clearly enhance public safety,'' said <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashur </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>' press secretary. The bill, which has passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on an 82-55 vote Wednesday and faces a final vote today. The action came despite arguments that the bill would interfere with adults' freedom of choice. Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> called the measure `` a nanny bill'' and said the current law requiring helmets for those under age 18 is sufficient. `` This is a baby-sitting bill,'' he said. He suggested that future measures in the same vein might `` tell us we need to get more exercise and eight hours' worth of sleep and stop smoking and eat all our vegetables and sit up straight.'' Rep. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> also defended his right to choose whether to wear protective headgear. `` I own a motorcycle, and I own a helmet. Sometimes I wear a helmet, and sometimes I do n't. It's a matter of choice. Sometimes I like to feel the wind blowing through my hair,'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> said the bill is `` an issue of public health, and it's an issue of legitimate public concern.'' He said studies show riders without helmets are more likely to have head injuries and are twice as likely to be killed in accidents. `` When a person neglects his own health, safety or his welfare, then all of us suffer,'' said <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, a physician and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill sponsor.

 Syrian gunners fired rocket and mortar rounds at a Christian <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> suburb and army positions southeast of the capital today in violation of a cease-fire called by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, police reported. A spokesman for Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, head of the Christian forces, said his army units `` did not respond to the provocative acts.'' There was no immediate report of casualties. Ten 120mm mortars bombarded positions manned by troops in <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION>, said the spokesman, who demanded anonymity. `` Three of the mortar rounds did not explode. They have bad ammunition.'' An hour later, six 122mm artillery rockets slammed into <PERSON> Dora </PERSON>, an east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> suburb, the spokesman said. A police spokesman said they were the only shots fired after the cease-fire was called. `` Other fronts are quiet,'' he said. Police said 177 people have been killed and 576 wounded in the month of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> between Christian and Moslem forces. The truce was called Wednesday by <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, who heads a six-man <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We appeal to all the warring Lebanese parties to observe a cease-fire as of midnight Wednesday,'' <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> before he met Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, rejected any truce accord that does not specifically include the Syrians as the main adversary to his 20,000 strong Christian troops. `` There is only one power on the other side that can cease or unleash fire. It is the Syrian army, and any Lebanese cover for the Syrian army is unacceptable,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s spokesman said the Christian forces `` will not shoot if the Syrian army stops shooting.'' After <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>'s talks with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> presidential spokesman, <PERSON> Jibran </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourieh </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> expressed support for the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee. The cease-fire call was welcomed by acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the pro-Syrian Moslem Cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` I urge all sides to comply with the proposed truce out of mercy for the battered population,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said in a statement. People's reaction was cautious. `` We've decided to leave the underground bomb shelter to check on our apartment and allow the children to enjoy some sunlight,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoghbi </PERSON>, a resident of east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Christian district of <LOCATION> Ashrafiyeh </LOCATION>. `` We are keeping the mattresses, blankets and supplies at the shelter. We'll return to the shelter around midday even if it was quiet,'' said <PERSON> Zoghbi </PERSON>, who runs an import-export business. Most of the 1 million Christians besieged by Syrian and allied forces in the 310-square-mile enclave northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> have spent a month in underground shelters to avoid the daily Syrian bombardment. Col. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Keogh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, acting spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, today said about 100,000 to 120,000 Lebanese had fled to the U.N.-controlled zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The cease-fire accord, as outlined by <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, called for lifting a blockade <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> imposed on militia-run ports and the siege of the Christian enclave by Syrian and allied forces. <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasbini </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, said he did not trust the cease-fire and was sending his wife and four children to live with friends in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The combatants are only giving us time to catch our breath, stockpile on food and water or leave before they start fighting again,'' he said.

 The J. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> <PERSON> Museum </PERSON> will add <PERSON> Pierre-Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON>'s `` The Promenade'' to its collection after bidding $ 17.7 million at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> auction, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> museum announced. The French Impressionist's oil painting, which depicts a man and a woman out for a stroll, was included in artwork held by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> sold Tuesday night at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. The pension fund bought artworks during the 1970s as investments. `` We are overjoyed to have the picture,'' Museum Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in a statement. `` It is one of <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON>'s most delightful works, and it comes from a great moment in the history of painting.'' The price was more than twice <ORGANIZATION> Renoir </ORGANIZATION>'s record $ 8.8 million set last May for a painting called `` Motherhood, or Woman Walking with her Child,'' and far more than `` The Promenade's'' estimated value of $ 7.5 million. It also was the seventh highest price ever paid for a painting at auction. With a $ 2.1 billion endowment from the late oil <PERSON> baron </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Mailbu </LOCATION> museum is the richest art institution in the world. `` It's a beautiful painting and a great acquisition,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Conisbee </PERSON>, curator of European paintings and sculpture at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Museum of Art. `` Although it is terribly expensive, I think it is a relatively good value.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> will send an official delegation to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the first time to attend the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> next month, the government announced today. The government said the 12-member delegation will be led by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON> and will include officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and government-owned banks. The decision, taken by the government Cabinet at a regular weekly meeting, was regarded as another step in a new Nationalist inititive to counter Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s efforts to isolate <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> internationally. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu-chu </PERSON>, told reporters the Cabinet's decision did not signal a change in government policies toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> would continue to oppose official contacts with the rival communists who won a civil war in 1949, forcing the Nationalists to flee to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said the delegation would not discuss relations between the rival governments and that the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> decided to approve the trip because the annual meeting was being organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and not <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. He said the delegation would attend the three-day meeting, which begins on May 4, to ensure that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> could `` actively participate'' in the development bank and also to fulfill <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s obligations as a founding member of the bank <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung-tung </PERSON>, history professor at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, described the government's decision as `` a major breakthrough'' and said it could lead to further flexibility toward the mainland. He said it was probably intended to pressure the Chinese communists to accept de facto Nationalist rule over this island. The Nationalists continue to claim they are the legitimate government of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and have maintained a policy of no contacts, no talks, no compromise toward communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since their defeat on the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> mainland. But in the past year, the Nationalists have relaxed their policy on private contacts between Taiwanese and mainland Chinese and have allowed an exchange of visits, trade and cultural ties. The <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1966 to help regional development. The 47-member organization voted in 1986 to admit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and changed <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s membership name from the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ the official <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> name _ to <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Nationalist officials protested then, saying the change relegated <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to a provincial government under <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Nationalists boycotted the development bank's annual meetings in 1986 and 1987 but attended last year's meeting in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, where the bank has its headquarters. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said the Nationalists are still opposed to the <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> designation. He said the Nationalists would continue to negotiate with the bank to work out a compromise solution acceptable to both parties. Since the 1970s, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has been virtually isolated diplomatically. It is now recognized by only 23 nations, while most other countries recognize the mainland government.

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> told a state commission investigating charges of patronage in city hiring that some apparently improper procedures amounted to `` peanuts'' when compared to the city's overall hiring system. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> appeared Wednesday before a commission studying claims that the <ORGANIZATION> Talent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a clearinghouse for city job applicants, was used to award city jobs to politically connected people. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> has heard testimony that the <ORGANIZATION> Talent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> had become a patronage operation, contrary to <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s intent. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the commission's hearings had created the impression `` that there is massive patronage in my administration and that this massive patronage was hidden behind a ` sham' affirmative action program.'' `` These charges are false,'' he said. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> called the number of <ORGANIZATION> Talent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> jobs filled under questionable circumstances from 1983 to 1986 `` peanuts.'' The Talent Bank placed about 3,000 people in jobs, most paying less than $ 20,000 a year. `` If I had wanted to have a massive patronage program, I could have,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` But I did not want to have, nor did I have, a patronage operation.'' In his defense, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said testimony had described practices at the Talent Bank that he would not have approved. Those practices involved only a part of the <ORGANIZATION> Talent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s job referral services _ the laborers, deck hands and ferry agents at two agencies, he said. `` And the Talent Bank itself was and is a very small part of the city's hiring program,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feerick </PERSON> asked the mayor if he had failed in his responsibilities because he was n't aware, among other things, that the Talent Bank computer listed applicants by who their political sponsor was; that documents were destroyed to hide this fact; that job postings were waived so they could be filled with political appointees. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he could only review the city's 42 agencies by checking results, not by watching day-to-day operations. <PERSON> Feerick </PERSON> said the commission would deliver a report to the governor sometime in May. The commission was appointed by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to investigate corruption and inefficiency in state and municipal governments. The commission can not prosecute but can report its findings to prosecutors and suggest legislation.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Increase in Radiation in Antarctic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Potentially dangerous ultraviolet radiation streamed through the south polar ozone hole during the antarctic spring at levels not usually reached until months later, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> reports. While few people reside in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> to be threatened by the potential for skin cancer and other damage from the radiation, scientists fear the rise there could presage conditions in other areas of the world. The increased ultraviolet radiation was measured at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> last September through December _ spring in that part of the world, the foundation reported Wednesday. `` This is the first measurement of a clearly significant enhancement in UV radiation reaching the ground that is linked to human impact on the ozone layer,'' reported <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. Scientists there have been studying radiation levels because of concerns about the depletion in the amount of ozone in the atmosphere high above the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>. That depletion has come to be known as an `` ozone hole'' in recent years. Ozone, which helps filter out dangerous radiation from the sun, is damaged by man-made chemicals, and the fear has risen that if it is depeleted over other parts of the earth, rates of skin cancer could rise and plants and other animals could also be damaged. The antarctic ozone depletion is usually at its worst in the September-December period, a time when there is generally only little sunligbt reaching that part of the world. Even so, the scientists found that rates of ultraviolet radiation reaching the ground were typical of those usually found in mid-summer in that region, a time of much more intense sunlight. The researchers are hoping to determine if the changes in radiation will affect the food chain in the region. Ultraviolet radiation can kill plankton, which form the basis of the food chain in the ocean, but the effect diminishes with the depth of the water. Early indications were that there was no immediate threat, the researchers said, but they plan to continue their studies. In a parallel experiment last fall, scientists working over the north polar region determined that an ozone hole has not appeared there, but they said conditions are ripe for depletion of the protective gas in that region also. A northern ozone hole could pose a much greater threat, since the bulk of the world's population lives in the northern hemisphere.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is considering a proposal to require that gun buyers register semiautomatic assault rifles of the kind linked to mounting drug-related violence. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>, said that proposal, among others, is being studied by government agencies as the administration weighs additional steps to control the deadly weapons. `` I've been asked to give comments on that and a lot of other proposals that were made,'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, said Wednesday. `` The administration is involved in looking at the entire issue, getting input from a lot of people, of which this agency is one.'' Another administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said today that putting semiautomatic rifles in the same category as machine guns _ requiring an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check and a waiting period _ is `` one of the options'' actively being considered. The official also said that some steps to crack down on the sales of high-powered, rapid-fire weapons could be announced by the administration within the next few weeks. An initial plan, dealing just with the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, was to be unveilled on Monday by federal drug coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. The official said this package would deal more with such issues as finding more prison space and expanded use of federal prosecutors than with the guns themselves, since the district already has tough gun-control laws on the books. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> made his comments as he discussed the administration's move to widen its temporary import ban on assault rifles to include virtually all foreign-made models Earlier Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had announced that 24 models of semiautomatic assault rifles were being added to the list of weapons already covered by the 90-day ban on imports imposed last month. The initial import suspension covered as many as 400,000 weapons. The additional list covers permits to import up to 250,000 more, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said. `` We think we've got 99.9 percent'' of the foreign-made semiautomatic rifles, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said. The 90-day period for banning imports of semiautomatic weapons will enable <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> to determine if any of the weapons on the list are used for legitimate sporting purposes. The Gun Control Act of 1968 bans the importation of weapons that are not used for legitimate sporting purposes. `` These are weapons which are identical in design'' to those on the original list, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said. `` They are basically paramilitary in appearance, they are large-capacity magazines.'' Importers have been given 30 days to `` substantiate that the weapons they are selling are being used for sporting purposes,'' he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said a prime reason for expanding the ban was to prevent a few gun manufacturers from gaining an unfair competitive edge. But he conceded that `` there is some unfairness'' because the ban still does not affect American-made high-powered rifles, which account for 75 percent to 80 percent of the market. `` Unfortunately, it is not something we can do anything about,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` To do anything about domestically manufactured weapons would require a change in the law.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to say whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would eventually propose a change in the law to include the American-made weapons. But <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said a proposal to require registration of semiautomatic assault-style rifles is under study. He said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has asked him to comment on imposing a registration requirement on semiautomatic rifles that would be akin to the current rules governing machine guns and other military weapons. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday night that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had asked to recommend what should be done about the weapons, told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a week ago that `` Rambo-looking rifles with a large clip'' should be treated the same as the machine guns. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cirignano </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> spokesman, said the network report was `` not an accurate depiction'' of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s views, but he declined to elaborate. `` We never talk about what we recommend to the president,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, last week proposed a $ 200 registration fee and a requirement that purchasers of the weapons be fingerprinted and submit to a background check. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s proposal was among a number of issues discussed last week by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and top federal law enforcement officials at a White House meeting. The <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> director declined to describe the administration's deliberations on the proposal `` But that system is being considered by a lot of different people,'' he said. The administration first suspended imports of assault rifles on March 14, amid mounting furor over the use of such guns by drug dealers and other criminals, notably the slaying of five children in a <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, schoolyard in January. The next day, <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> suspended sales of its popular AR-15 rifle, an American-made weapon similar to assault-style rifles covered by the import ban. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, has slowly been moving away from the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s hard-line advocacy of the right to bear arms of any type. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initially opposed any outlawing of guns, the latest move marks another advance in the administration's tougher stance on assault weapons. The president's latest action drew sharp criticism from a group of conservative <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers who met with White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> to register their objections. `` Most of us felt the action today solves no problems. Administratively, it's a nightmare. Practically, it solves nothing,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>. Widening the ban was `` a confirmation of the fact that he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- is parting company'' with gun-control opponents, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>.

 Workers and radical students demonstrated for the seventh straight day today to protest the police assault that broke a strike at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s largest shipyard. At least 12 people were reported arrested. Government officials said the unrest in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> was becoming a showdown between authorities and `` labor movement forces,'' and President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> met with security officials to discuss the protest. `` The most urgent task facing us now is to safeguard the nation's free democratic system from leftist forces,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told the meeting at the presidential residence in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION>, 150 miles southwest of the capital, hundreds of striking workers hurled rocks and firebombs at police in the streets around the strike-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> shipyard, news reports said. Police responded with tear gas, they said. The news reports said 2,000 striking workers demonstrated. In the last two days, about 200 police, workers and citizens were injured in the street battles, the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. It said a house and 38 cars were burned by firebombs thrown by striking workers. Protests broke out after police raided the shipyard March 30, arresting 700 workers and ending a strike that had left 400 people injured since Dec. 12. Most of those arrested were released, but formal charges have been filed against 10 union leaders. About 3,000 police guarded the shipyard. Company officials said 60 percent of the shipyard's 19,500 employees reported to work. Police today arrested about a dozen strikers who attacked non-striking workers on their way to work, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. Hundreds of police were deployed around residential areas to protect non-striking workers, it said. `` The government's authority is being tested, and we will not back down,'' said a senior government official in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The three main opposition parties dispatched investigative teams to <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> today to look into the situation. Before departure, they urged the government to stop using forceful means and try to settle the problem through dialogue. Prosecutor-general <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gi-chun </PERSON> today called for stern measures to stop violent protests and said the government was prepared for a `` major showdown'' with leftist groups. On Wednesday, the government ordered an investigatation of 25 leading dissident and labor groups which have either sought contact with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for talks on national unification or spearheaded anti-government rallies.

 A `` highly tentative'' projection by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> shows that 1989 wheat production could be about 2.45 billion bushels, a 35 percent boost from last year's drought-shriveled harvest If the harvest turns out to be that much, it would be the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat output since 1984, when production was almost 2.6 billion bushels. Wheat production dropped in later years as tighter acreage restrictions were imposed to help curb rising grain surpluses. And drought took its toll last year as production dropped to 1.81 billion bushels. Suddenly, once-large grain inventories were drained off and market prices rose. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> eased planting requirements for 1989 and is looking at possible adjustments for next year. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has published a `` preliminary regulatory analysis'' of the current wheat situation to help plan the 1990 program, including some fresh projections for this year. `` The forecasts for the 1989 crop year are highly tentative,'' the report said. `` Production forecasts are subject to wide variability at this time because winter wheat has not been harvested and spring wheat has not been planted.'' Despite such vagaries, the agency's report projected the 1989 wheat acreage for harvest at 65.5 million acres, up nearly a fourth from 53.2 million acres harvested in 1988. That would be the largest acreage since 1984 when 66.9 million were harvested. The average yield per acre harvested was projected at 37.4 bushels, up from 34 bushels in 1988. That would produce a total wheat crop this year of 2.45 billion bushels. Despite the boost in production, it would leave total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat supplies in the 1989-90 marketing year that will begin June 1 at only 3 billion bushels, about what they were in the current year. Total wheat use in the year ahead was projected at 2.47 billion bushels, or still more than this the 1989 harvest. As a result, the wheat carryover a year from now _ on June 1, 1990 _ would be around 534 million bushels, or the same as it is expected to be this June 1. The report projected the farm price of wheat to average $ 3.65 per bushel over the 1989-90 marketing year, down 10 cents from a forecast of $ 3.75 for the current year. Analysts said the projections take into account severe drought in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> where wheat production is expected to be cut sharply this year. Other <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> insider estimates of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> wheat production are ranging from about 190 million bushels to as much as 315 million bushels this year, compared with 323 million bushels produced in 1988 and a 1986-88 annual average of 342 million. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> wheat farmers planted 12.4 million acres last fall, up sharply from 10.2 million planted for the 1988 crop. According to one set of jottings, abandonment because of dry weather might reduce this year's harvest to 10.5 million acres, in which case yields could average 30 bushels per acre _ a total state output of 315 million bushels. Under another `` scenario,'' however, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> crop might be reduced to 9.9 million harvested acres, a yield of 25 bushels and a total output of 250 million bushels. The worst case version calls for 9.3 million acres harvested, an average of 20 bushels per acre and a total harvest of 190 million bushels.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to step up purchases of pork for donation to schools and other institutions to help bolster sagging hog prices paid to farmers. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Wednesday the department `` not only has bought more pork this year, but it also has bought a greater variety of pork items than in prior years.'' Frozen hams and canned pork are the main items bought by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> for distribution to schools and other domestic feeding programs. In addition, the department soon will begin buying canned luncheon meat, including pork, he said. Farmers have marketed `` unusually high'' numbers of hogs in recent months, which have helped depress market prices, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. Since last July 1, the beginning of the current purchasing year, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has spent more than $ 96 million for pork, compared with $ 30 million the previous year.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 200,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery this year under a long-term supply agreement. More than 2.3 million tons have been purchased since the Soviets resumed buying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn on March 28 after a layoff of almost three months. The corn is scheduled for delivery by Sept. 30, the end of the sixth year of a long-term grain supply agreement between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Officials said Wednesday the latest sales brought total corn sold to the Soviets for 1988-89 to more than 12.5 million tons. Additionally, sales include 4 million tons of wheat, 450,000 tons of soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of grain sorghum. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 200,000 tons of corn would be about 7.9 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.46 per bushel at the farm level, according to the latest <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> five-day average, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 20 million.

 Hundreds of thousands of city dwellers seeking to escape from a record heat wave found the beaches too hot to handle. Even Death Valley had cooler readings. `` It's hotter than sin,'' said <LOCATION> Seal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> lifeguard <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cushman </PERSON>. `` People are even jumping into the showers with their clothes on out here.'' And forecasters said there's more heat ahead. Wednesday's 105 degrees at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> surpassed by a whopping 15 degrees the record of 90 for April 5, set in 1971. It was the hottest reading ever posted in April, breaking the 100-degree mark set April 23, 1910, and tied on Tuesday. Forecasters said today's predicted high of 102 degrees downtown will easily eclipse the record 91-degree peak set April 6, 1939.

 Moslem guerrillas today ignored a cease-fire declared by the government and fired missiles and rockets at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and three other cities, witnesses and the government said. A missile blew up a fuel truck parked near a petroleum tank depot on the northern edge of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Several trucks parked nearby also exploded. A cloud of black smoke, visible over the city of 2 million, drifted from the site. There was no immediate word on casualties. An Afghan truck driver who said he was part of a convoy hauling fuel down the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> Highway from <LOCATION> Hayratan </LOCATION>, on the Soviet border, said guerrillas tried to hijack some of the trucks a few miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The driver, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the hijackers got about a mile before they were attacked by two government helicopters. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said guerrillas fired rockets and cannons at the cities of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sarobi </LOCATION>. Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said government troops held their fire. He had no information on casualties. His report could not be confirmed. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s military command announced a unilateral cease-fire Wednesday night on the eve of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, the Islamic holy month. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that the government would retaliate with renewed force if the U.S.-backed guerrillas broke the cease-fire. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said guerrillas fired 32 rockets and cannon rounds today at the southern city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, where government forces have been besieged for the past year. Fewer than 100 rounds were fired at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, he said. In the past two weeks, the government has accused the guerrillas of firing as many as 12,000 rounds a day at the city, which is 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said he had no indication how many rounds were fired at <LOCATION> Sarobi </LOCATION>, midway between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. The Ramadan cease-fire was at least the fifth unilateral cessation of hostilities declared by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> since January 1987. None has succeeded. The guerrillas have ignored every government-declared cease-fire, and the government itself usually quickly follows suit. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, who left <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Monday, still was waiting for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He wants to appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to hold a special <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> session on the Afghan fighting. On Wednesday, guerrilla rockets slammed into downtown <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, killing six people and wounding 23, a government official said on condition of anonymity. Official Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said 10 people were killed and 39 wounded. Most of the Afghan guerrillas are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. They have received support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and other countries in their decade-old war against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s protege government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> ended its nine-year involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> Feb. 15, but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is still supplying the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government. Wednesday's rockets spewed shrapnel and debris as they hit a small park next to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> Hotel and a commercial district several blocks away. The rockets, which landed four to 10 blocks from the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, were fired before noon, when sidewalks and marketplaces are crowded with pedestrians.

 This potato-farming community of about 600 is facing insolvency after being ordered to pay $ 50,000 to settle a decade-old lawsuit by a pool-hall owner arrested for opening on a Sunday. Town Attorney <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobo </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> it has been ordered to pay by 4 p.m. Tuesday or the council members will be held in contempt of court. <PERSON> Jacobo </PERSON> told council members they have about $ 65,000 available but also have unrelated bills totaling $ 31,000. `` If you vote to pay it the settlement, you vote to make the town insolvent,'' <PERSON> Jacobo </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have the money to pay.'' The council authorized <PERSON> Jacobo </PERSON> to ask attorneys for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, the pool-hall owner, to accept $ 20,000 now and $ 10,000 a year until the debt is paid. Alternatives would be for the town to declare bankruptcy or ask the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to take away the town's charter. If the town becomes insolvent, <PERSON> Jacobo </PERSON> said the state might pull the town's charter anyway. About 75 people crammed into Town Hall late Wednesday to find out whether <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> could remain solvent. One resident, <PERSON> Dartha </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, said none of the council members were in city government when the arrest was made and should not be held accountable. She blamed former Mayors <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> and the former town attorney for the problem. In 1978, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, now 52, was arrested for operating his game room on a Sunday afternoon, in violations of a local law. County Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreu </PERSON> threw out the charges, and <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> filed a lawsuit. He claimed he lost $ 100,000 in business from the incident. A jury awarded him $ 44,000 in 1981, but a judge reduced it to $ 23,800. Later, a new trial was ordered and this time, in 1984, a jury awarded him $ 65,000. Some payments have been made, but the town still owes almost $ 50,000.

 A Palestinian died today of a gunshot wound sustained in earlier violence, and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier shot and critically wounded a teen-age protester in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, witnesses and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. Six other Palestinians _ a woman and five teen-agers _ were reportedly wounded in two other clashes in Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army said it was checking the reports. An Israeli newspaper reported from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, meanwhile, that Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> may order a withdrawal of troops from some of the heavily populated areas in the occupied territories. Israeli editorial writers responded with satisfaction to results of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s meeting Wednesday with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who called the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader's peace ideas `` very encouraging.'' Editors wrote it was an indication <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s meeting today with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not turn into a confrontation. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, 200 Palestinians chanting `` PLO! <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> No!'' followed the coffin of <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, 27. Arab reports and doctors at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he died today, said <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> was shot in the head during a March 30 clash with troops. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, reporters said they saw a soldier shoot and critically wound a 17-year-old Palestinian. The incident began when 100 Palestinians threw stones and empty bottles near <LOCATION> Manger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the reporters said. Four soldiers arrived, chased fleeing demonstrators and fired live ammunition at them, according to the reporters. One soldier ran after <PERSON> Nassar </PERSON>, knelt on the ground, took aim and shot the youth twice from about 40 yards away, the reporters said. <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> doctors said the youth was critically wounded. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, a 38-year-old woman and a 17-year-old boy were shot and wounded when troops opened fire on a protest against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. `` <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is no good!'' some youths shouted. Troops also wounded four teen-age boys in the arms and legs when they opened fire on stone-throwing protesters at <LOCATION> Khan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yunis </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army said it wounded two youths there. Arab reports said other confrontations occurred in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, but there were no injuries. The violence occurred a day after the army freed 465 Palestinian prisoners as a goodwill gesture for the Moslem month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, which starts tonight. The releases also coincided with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on reviving the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. Hadashot newspaper reported the prime minister was considering three other moves to satisfy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for eased tensions. One possibility is `` a symbolic withdrawal of Israeli forces from several heavily concentrated population centers,'' it said, adding this did not mean a full pullback. Two other gestures included opening <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools shut through most of the uprising and freezing deportation orders against 13 Palestinians. Since the uprising began in December 1987, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has deported to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> 45 Palestinians accused of inciting riots. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had condemned such expulsions. At least 420 Palestinians have been killed in the rebellion. Eighteen Israelis also have died.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fraternity has been charged with violating the school's anti-hazing policy after a Jewish pledge wore a Nazi uniform on campus. Representatives of the Triniteers fraternity have a week to defend the practice before a dean. If found guilty, penalties could involve revocation of the fraternity's charter, mandatory community service or probation limiting the fraternity's social activities. The president of the fraternity, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturdivant </PERSON>, said the incident `` is being blown completely out of proportion'' and that punishment is not warranted. The student, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellenthal </PERSON>, dressed as a Nazi soldier with a swastika armband on March 30 as part of a fraternity tradition requiring pledges to wear costumes. He did not wear the costume to class. <PERSON> Ellenthal </PERSON>, 18, said he selected and purchased the outfit himself, adding that it was intended only as a joke. After the matter is resolved, dean <PERSON> Coleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON> intends to bring together fraternity and sorority members, professors and other students to discuss the implications of the incident. `` She wants to convey that certain images and symbols are unacceptable,'' <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said.

 A Palisades Park principal has been suspended by the school board for allowing a movie with nudity to be filmed at his high school two years ago. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotonda </PERSON> said Wednesday that the suspension was `` political'' and demanded to be reinstated. <PERSON> Rotonda </PERSON> was suspended Saturday for letting New York-based Upfront Productions use the school to make a movie that shows actresses, posing as teachers and students, briefly exposing their breasts. <PERSON> Rotonda </PERSON> said the district school board had approved the movie, `` Senior Week,'' which the filmmakers had told him would be a spoof on spring break. He said the movie, made in the summer of 1987, was filmed on weekends and at night when he was not present to supervise. The school board has denied knowing anything about the agreement with the movie company. Dozens of students marched Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Palisades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> to protest <PERSON> Rotonda </PERSON>'s suspension, and teachers approved a resolution backing him and calling for his reinstatement. The existence of the film was made public a few days before Tuesday's school board election in which a board president opposed by <PERSON> Rotonda </PERSON> was seeking re-election. Board President <PERSON> Janette </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON> and five of her supporters were defeated in the balloting to fill six vacant seats on the nine-member board. `` I'm just trying to get my name cleared at the moment and have them put me back in the school,'' said <PERSON> Rotonda </PERSON>, 51, who has been principal at the high school for six years. `` They lost the election. Let's just get back to business.'' `` As a result of a political battle I was being used as a scapegoat,'' <PERSON> Rotonda </PERSON> said. He said he was denied due process and was considering what action to take with his lawyer. School Superintendent <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fasciano </PERSON>, who suspended <PERSON> Rotonda </PERSON> until the board could meet and investigate the matter, was in the hospital Wednesday and unavailable for comment. Ms. <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON>, vice president of the board when the film was made, said she asked to have <PERSON> Rotonda </PERSON> suspended after finding his name on an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Upfront </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> that the school board knew nothing about.

He said he was not pressured to leave his post. Among those mentioned as possible replacements was <PERSON> Sherrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> aide who was on loan to the White House during the unsuccessful confirmation proceedings for Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorneys <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also have been mentioned, along with <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. At a news conference, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said he was confident the next <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> chairman would carry on an agenda seeking deregulation. He said there would be `` no substantial slowing of progress.'' `` It is not a static -LRB- telecommunications -RRB- market and the regulatory response will not be static,'' he said. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> thanked President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` for his continuing support'' despite rumors he had been on the skids since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took office. Calling his resignation `` absolutely voluntary,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said, `` The White House has been absolutely supportive of me since day one.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said he would return to private industry but would remain in his job until a replacement was named. The 37-year-old former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> attorney said he has no plans, has conducted no job interviews and would not excuse himself from any pending FCC decisions. Until he leaves the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, `` it will be business as usual,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said. `` We have accomplished substantially all'' his agenda, and now `` I desire and am very anxious to return to the private sector.'' One of <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s congressional foes, Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., said he looked forward to a better `` balance'' between consumer and business interests under a new <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> chairman He said deregulation under <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> had turned into `` deregulation for deregulation's sake.''

Under <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, the commission also has moved to change the way broadcasters are licensed, guaranteed exclusive licenses to syndicated TV programs, made a preliminary ruling on standards for high-definition television and generally has followed the deregulatory approach of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The commission has been two members short of its normal five-member complement since last year.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> converted a $ 3,000 speaking fee from a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> university into a bulk sale of his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' because he otherwise could n't accept the money under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, the speaker acknowledged The sale of 504 copies of the book to <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> following a 1984 lecture <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> delivered at the school is under examination, along with other such sales, as part of an ethics committee investigation of the speaker's finances. The panel is looking into whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> used the book sales in some instances to evade limits House rules impose on outside income from speaking and writing fees, and is examining other areas of the speaker's conduct for potential violations of at least four other rules. In October 1984, when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> delivered the university speech, he already was bumping up against the $ 23,630 maximum he could accept in speaking fees for the year under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules. In addition, the $ 3,000 check the university sent him was $ 1,000 more than the maximum the rules allow. An aide asked him what to do about it, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters on Wednesday. `` I said $ 3,000 is actually more than I can properly accept,'' the speaker said he responded. `` He said, well, maybe they want to buy some books. I said if they want to buy some books, that'll be fine. I do n't think there's anything wrong with that.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s income from the book sales _ about $ 1,650 _ was not subject to House limitations. The incident is similar to a previously reported bulk sale of the book in 1985, when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sent 336 copies to The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> life insurance company in return for $ 2,000 initially intended as an honorarium. But in that case, the speaker's office defended it by saying the deal was arranged by aides without <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s knowledge. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received 55 percent of the proceeds from each copy of the slim $ 5.95 volume, collecting a total of $ 55,000 in royalties. The ethics committee met again today and had a full day of deliberations scheduled for Friday. Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he anticipated some conclusion in the case next week <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> also said the committee is asking the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to add $ 600,000 to its budget for this year, in part to cover growing costs of the Wright probe. `` We're basically out of money,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. He said the money would go to cover additional fees for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, the outside counsel retained for the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> investigation, to cover expenses incurred in that probe, and to pay for other unrelated ethics cases. In addition to the issue of evading income ceilings, the ethics panel also is deliberating several other potential rules violations: _ Whether the speaker should have reported as gifts a series of benefits he received from a business partner, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>; _ Whether <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had `` a direct interest'' in legislation, which would have made any gift over $ 100 improper; _ Whether in working for `` forbearance'' language in a bill dealing with savings and loan institutions, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> improperly used influence on behalf of a business partner; and _ Whether the speaker's overall conduct violated a general requirement that a lawmaker `` conduct himself at all times in a manner which shall reflect creditably on the House As the committee went into the home stretch in its deliberations, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s allies were preparing their defense, compiling lengthy point-by-point rebuttals to potential findings of rules violations. But the speaker's opponents said even if some charges are dropped, the remaining issues are serious enough to cause the speaker severe political damage. `` The evidence strikes me as fairly overwhelming,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s chief

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> today argued passionately during a four-hour meeting that covered subjects ranging from disarmament to reports of Soviet bomber sales to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, officials said. Reopening a European peace offensive that was disrupted by the Armenian earthquake, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had `` extremely frank exchanges, animated, warm, passionate and solemn,'' said a Thatcher spokesman, requesting anonymity. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also hit the streets of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, stopping his motorcade to shake hands with about 20 people in a crowd of several hundred who cheered him outside <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abbey </LOCATION>. The Thatcher spokesman said the Soviet leader and the staunchly anti-communist prime minister `` love arguing.'' Emerging from her 10 Downing St. residence into the icy rain, with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at her side, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told reporters: `` The talks have been very deep, very wide ranging and very friendly, and as always we got to grips with the real issues.'' The spokesman said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about a report from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sold up to 15 long-range fighter-bombers to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> accuses of sponsoring terrorism. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not respond, he said. He said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also accused the Soviets of having been `` not as frank as they should be'' about their chemical weapons arsenal. He quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as replying: `` If you are n't fully satisfied, then quite clearly we have to have more exchanges. We have got to try better to convince each other.'' Another area of disagreement was <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> believes the deterrence of nuclear weapons prevents war and `` expressed her objection to any suggestion'' of scrapping short-range nuclear weapons, the spokesman said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is the first <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> country <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has visited since the earthquake cut short his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour in December and forced him to reschedule a trip to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Arriving at Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s residence, he waved and smiled to onlookers and was applauded by office staff who lined the corridors. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said the talks were `` an example of the new spirit of friendliness and negotiation and cooperation between East and West.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> thanked the British people `` for reaching out to the people of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and to the people of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'' in the earthquake relief effort. He said the British-Soviet dialogue `` has reached a very high level now. It is a very substantive dialogue. And I must say the degree of mutual understanding is increasing.'' He said this `` has enabled us today to discuss constructively the various problems of international politics.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, went sightseeing in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, starting at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>'s Cathedral where she gave a bear hug to a 4-year-old girl who presented her with a bouquet of flowers. The Gorbachevs went to Westminster Abbey to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, then <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met the crowds. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggarty </PERSON>, 23, from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, who waited in the rain for 90 minutes to be first to shake hands, said afterward: `` He's trying to create peace in the world He has to be treated like the hero he is.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he said, told him in Russian: `` I thank you very much for being here. It's really nice to see you.'' At Downing Street, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> sipped champagne and watched as their foreign ministers, Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, signed memorandums of understanding to ease travel restrictions between the two countries and boost British investment in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. They also signed an agreement for British contractors to build a $ 7 million school in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, a city devastated by the Armenian earthquake. Explaining the Armenian project, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said: `` When we asked the people of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> what they would like as a gift they asked us especially for a new school.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> arrived late Wednesday night from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, where he proposed making <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a `` zone of peace.'' In a major speech Friday at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Guildhall </LOCATION>, he is expected to press for something similar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, her spokesman said, thanked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for a Soviet decision to release nine prisoners believed to be jailed for religious activities and to allow 14 more Jewish refuseniks to emigrate. But about 50 people, including former <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, stood across the street from 10 Downing St., reading aloud from a list of 10,000 names of refuseniks being denied permission to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 A federal judge today fined the state $ 164,250 for prison overcrowding and ordered that the money be used to set up a bail fund for indigent defendants. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON> ruled the state was in contempt of court for failing to limit to 250 the number of prisoners awaiting trial in an intake unit. Overcrowding at <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s only jail for inmates awaiting trial has been a problem for years, but mushroomed last year after the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passed laws allowing drug defendants to be held without bail. The <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, under pressure from <LOCATION> Pettine </LOCATION>, opened two annexes to the intake unit, but has been unable to keep up with the exploding population. Construction of a new prison building has been stalled by local opposition in <LOCATION> Cranston </LOCATION>, where the Adult Correctional Institutions complex is located. Last fall, <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON> gave the state until Feb. 20 to reduce the population at the intake unit to 250. As of Monday, the population was 464, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiNitto </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON> imposed fines of $ 50 per extra inmate per day from Feb. 20 to March 13, and said further fines up to $ 289,000 or more would be imposed if necessary to meet his order to reduce crowding. `` I think that's just what was needed to ensure this problem is taken care of,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> sued the state 13 years ago over prison conditions. <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON> ordered the state to turn over the money within 15 days to the Corrections Department, but stayed the order to give state officials a chance to appeal. <PERSON> DiNitto </PERSON> said he had not yet seen the ruling and would not comment on it. The governor said the decision will be appealed. <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON> praised the state for submitting long-range plans to alleviate overcrowding, but said the state should be fined because it ignored options such as the bail fund proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. Any prisoner being held on $ 5,000 or less cash bail will be eligible to have bail paid by the fund. <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON> recommended that maximum use be squeezed from the money by bailing first those prisoners being held on $ 1,000 bail or less before those being held on higher amounts. `` These pre-trial detainees are in jail only because they are too poor to make bail,'' <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON> wrote.

 A government contracting officer testified today that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had received a better-than-expected price when it negotiated a $ 24 million contract with a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> defense contractor to make hand-held radar equipment in July 1987. The testimony of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Massie </PERSON>, who handled contracts for the project, came as the defense opened its case in the trial of three former executives at <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. All are charged with bribery, conspiracy and making false statements Before a parade of defense witnesses was called, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> denied defense motions to dismiss bribery and conspiracy charges against the three _ <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON>. The government finished its case Wednesday with prosecutors attempting to persuade the jury that the three defendants knew a private consultant hired by <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> had paid bribes to a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer to help secure the radar equipment contract. The defense contends the former executives were unwittingly duped by private consultants hired by the company. <PERSON> Massie </PERSON>, the contracting officer, said the government's objective was to allow the defense contractor a 13.74 percent rate of profit on the job. In fact, <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> agreed to only a 13.5 percent rate of profit, meaning the government got a cheaper price than it had expected. Under cross-examination, however, <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> acknowledged that that price was still `` not necessarily'' the best possible price. On Wednesday, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, a consultant who has pleaded guilty to bribery and is cooperating with the government, testified that he took a portion of the money that <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> gave him and channeled it to another consultant, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, in turn, paid bribes to <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer familiar with the contract. The government contends that the three defendants knew that <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and his consortium were bribing <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The defense says the former <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> executives were innocent victims of a conspiracy devised by <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> paid Parkin $ 10,000 in up-front money in November 1985 to help win the contract, and agreed to hand over another $ 150,000 in February 1988 after <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> won the contract. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Swinhoe </PERSON> testified that he had interviewed <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> after the government's investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud and kickbacks was made public in June 1988. According to the agent, <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> said he was `` not aware of any illegal or unethical behavior'' on <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>'s part. But <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> said he was skeptical of the consultant `` by virtue of Mr. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>'s profession as an influence peddler.'' <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president dealing with government contracts, said the `` nature of the environment'' in which <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> worked was also cause for some concern. On the witness stand, <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> admitted that he had taken about $ 50,000 in bribes over a 10-year period while he was employed by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, where he had been director of acquisitions for the Joint Cruise Missile Project, in October 1983. The trial in federal court is the first brought by the government in its investigation of the $ 150 billion purchasing system at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Except for the three executives, all the people named in the indictment, including Parking, <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, have pleaded guilty, as has <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Troops loyal to Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> guarded the National Palace today with anti-aircraft guns and cannons after he declared a state of emergency to counter the week's second military rebellion. The order Wednesday by the embattled president, in power for just six months, also included a dusk-to-dawn curfew. Early today, he went on state-run television to appeal to the mutineers to end their uprising. Government forces also stood guard outside the national bank and the telecommunications office, which were briefly occupied by the rebels Wednesday. Sporadic machine-gun fire and what sounded like exploding grenades could be heard during the night. Radio <PERSON> Soleil </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> station, reported today that one man was shot to death and three other people were wounded overnight, but the circumstances were unclear. Several hundred youths marched into downtown <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> at midmorning and erected barricades of tires and boxes which they set on fire. Soldiers fired into the air to disperse the crowd. About 25 rebel soldiers and 200 supporters stood outside a military barracks 200 yards away from the palace, which was guarded by loyal soldiers. Most stores were closed, and few buses or cars moved through the capital. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> appeared on television at 2 a.m., speaking calmly for about 10 minutes from his office in the National Palace. He was surrounded by soldiers. `` I exhort you brothers in arms, soldiers of our splendid army, to leave the vile path of treason and national shame and find once again the shining path of honor and dignity,'' he said. Wednesday's uprising was the second in the 7,000-man army since Sunday, when an attempt to overthrow <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s government was foiled by loyal soldiers who rescued him as he was being driven to the airport to be deported. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> denounced the rebels who held his 14-year-old son and 88-year-old mother hostage during Sunday's coup attempt. The soldiers also briefly held hostage two of <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s brothers. All were released unharmed. In imposing a curfew Wednesday, the government blamed Sunday's coup attempt on a `` vast campaign against drug trafficking, contraband and corruption'' that `` collided with the interests'' of those who oppose democratic change <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has recently discharged or transferred several officers in a crackdown on corruption and drug trafficking. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made the crackdown a condition for the resumption of $ 70 million in annual aid that it suspended after thugs killed 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s first free elections in more than 30 years. On Wednesday, a rebellion broke out in the <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION>, which adjoins the presidential palace. It was unknown how many of the 700 Dessalines were taking part. About 25 Dessaline soldiers and 200 supporters stood today outside the barracks, demanding <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> hand over power to the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, a former justice minister. `` There is no compromise possible with Gen. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>,'' said one soldier on condition of anonymity. `` We will camp here until he leaves.'' But it did not seem <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, who appears to have the support of the 1,000 presidential guardsmen, would relinquish power voluntarily. `` It's a standoff. I think they're just staring each other down,'' one Western diplomat said. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s Presidential Guard stationed two anti-aircraft guns, four armored personnel carriers and three-wheeled cannons inside the National Palace compound. Radio stations ignored a government order for newspapers, radio and television not to diseminate information except with the military's permission. The censorship order came after the Dessalines soldiers went on the independent radio Metropole to demand Avril resign. They blame him for the deaths of four rebel soldiers who held the airport Sunday and Monday. Those four were members of the elite 400-member <PERSON> Leopard </PERSON> commando unit that had about 100 of its soldiers holding the airport because their commander was being held under military guard, accused of being the ringleader of Sunday's attempt to overthrow <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> deported the three alleged coup leaders. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration officials said the three officers arrived Wednesday and applied for asylum. A statement by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION>, read on state television, ordered all soldiers to report to their command posts. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, 50, came to power in a Sept. 17 coup led by noncommissioned officers who said they overthrow Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> because they wanted to end state-sponsored violence and corruption. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> took over in 1986 when longtime dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

 A Navajo tribal judge has banned the tribe's police chief from the reservation for failing to enforce court orders related to embattled Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s struggle to retain power Window Rock District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON> signed an order Wednesday excluding Police Chief <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> from the reservation pending a hearing on Monday. An anti-MacDonald majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has voted to place <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> on leave, but the flamboyant head of the nation's largest <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> tribe has resisted `` For the last two months, I've just been a football back and forth between the two factions,'' said <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, who remained at his office late Wednesday. <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> was found in contempt and fined $ 500 by the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week for having failed to enforce a court order barring <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, an appointee of the pro-MacDonald <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, from taking over <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON>'s court.

The issue is n't MacDonald or <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was placed on paid administrative leave by the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> after witnesses before a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee testified he received gifts and kickbacks in connection with tribal business dealings. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who has denied such wrongdoing, has maintained the council's action was invalid and illegal.

 Some <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> blamed psychological attacks and malicious press coverage for the humiliating defeat of 12 city officials in last month's elections, a newspaper reported Thursday. But others at a special meeting called to discuss the election disaster said the party itself was responsible for the `` crisis of confidence'' in its abilities, said <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>, the Russian republic's official party and government newspaper. The meeting, the first extraordinary session of the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party organization in 30 years, came four days after some party members demanded the resignation of the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> leadership, the newspaper said. Leningraders on March 26 rejected every one of local officials running for seats in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s new parliament, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON>, a candidate member of the party's ruling Politburo and regional party chief, ran unopposed and still lost because more than half the voters crossed out his name on the ballot. He characterized the results as `` depressing,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossia </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday's meeting `` occurred in an atmosphere of openness, honesty and toughness of evaluation, and impartial criticism, which we have dreamed about since the beginning of perestroika.'' The newspaper concluded that if such a meeting had occurred previously, the party might not have suffered so in the elections. `` Leningraders are not satisfied with the tempo and path of perestroika in the city,'' the newspaper quoted V.P. <PERSON> Smirnov </PERSON> as saying. `` They do n't feel that the leadership of the city defends the interests of the population, of the working class or the intelligentsia,'' said <PERSON> Smirnov </PERSON>, a radio controller and member of the regional party leadership. Clearly, `` a crisis of confidence has been outlined,'' he said. But the newspaper said many speakers blamed the loss on `` malicious press, strongly creating a negative stereotype of the party bureaucrats.'' It listed four party leaders who `` spoke with alarm about the psychological attack being carried out against the party. And is n't it strange that some organs of the press united with forces which are extremely far from the ideas of Marxism-Leninism. The report did not give examples of what they regarded as `` malicious'' press coverage. `` We insufficiently evaluated the ideological prejudice and bourgeois illusions which have been spreadly recently, and the dissatisfaction of the people with the growth of the deficit, inflation, crime, miscalculations in the organization of the cooperative movement,'' the newspaper said, paraphrasing the four officials. It identified the four as Y.A. <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON>, the director of an institute; Y.A. <PERSON> Sidorenko </PERSON>, an official of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>; S.B. <PERSON> Petrov </PERSON>, director of a sewing factory; and V.A. <PERSON> Yefimov </PERSON>, party leader of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> region. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said the turning point of the meeting came when general contractor I.D. <PERSON> Spassky </PERSON> warned that if the party does n't start showing it can solve citizens' problems, it can expect more of the same. `` People want to live better today,'' he said. `` The process of renewal of the economy at the least must move in parallel with political changes, but the prosperity of the people should outstrip it. Only then will the people believe us. And in the meantime, they wait for years and lose faith in perestroika.'' Across the nation in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Khabarovsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief V.S. <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON> blamed his loss on the late President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and his corrupt cronies. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON> said people were sick of commands, and looked at all party leaders with the same distrust. <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON> said a leaflet was circulated in <LOCATION> Khabarovsk </LOCATION> that said, `` A vote for <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON> means a vote for the party which led our motherland into this dead end and now with the help of demogogic subterfuges, is trying to convince people it can lead them out of this situation.''

<HEAD>Holiest Moslem Month of Fasting Starts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Moslems in several countries began a dawn to dusk fast Thursday, a daily religious ritual that will last for the entire Islamic month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. The fasting in <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest month is one of the major sacraments of the faith for the world's 1 billion Moslems. The month marks the time when the Angel <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> inspired the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> to write the Koran, or Moslem holy book, according to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>. Saudi Arabian King Fahd, custodian of Islam's holiest shrines at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, and Crown Prince <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> concentrated on the bloodshed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in their annual <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> message. They appealed to the warring Lebanese Christians and Syrian and Druse Moslem militiamen `` to achieve the peace that all heavenly religions have prescribed to spare human bloodshed and to preserve the dignity of man.'' Travelers, soldiers at war and pregnant women are exempt from the fast, which traditionally starts when the crescent moon marking a new month in the Islamic lunar calendar is sighted by the naked eye. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> announced late Wednesday that sightings had been reported to a special religious council, and therefore the holy month would start Thursday. Moslems also started fasting in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, where the oldest Islamic theology university of <LOCATION> Al-Azhar </LOCATION> is located, the responsible religious council calculated the preceding Moslem month would end Thursday, starting <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> on Friday. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> have made similar announcements. The Sultanate of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> has to wait for its council to look for the crescent. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, dominated by the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> minority sect of Islam, usually starts <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> a day after all others. The predominant sect of Islam is Sunni. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> falls along sectarian lines. The 800,000 Sunnis, following <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, started fasting Thursday. The Shiites, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest sect with 1 million members, will follow <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and start Friday.

 A government newspaper Thursday praised <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist authorities and Solidarity for displaying common sense in an agreement that it said legalizes the union while challenging it to act constructively `` Common sense came out on top,'' the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said, telling its readers that in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> the `` participation of the opposition in the official political life of the country has become a fact.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has watched the legalization of opposition forces in its allies <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> while its own <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> continues to tolerate no challengers. One controversial figure, former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, is under investigation by the party on charges that he supports a multiparty system. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON>, asked about the developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was watching a process it considered an internal Polish affair. `` We wish that dialogue to lead to results or developments that could improve the situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> so that the life of the Polish people can be brought back to normal,'' <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> said. The conclusion of negotiations in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was reported by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> and by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency, but <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> gave its millions of readers a much more detailed account that included the formation of a second chamber of the parliament, legalization of Solidarity and other key changes. The agreement, reached Wednesday, gives <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> its first democratic elections since World War II. It said the agreement would not have been possible without reforms carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the last eight years, but that Solidarity also showed a realistic attitude. The agreement `` would not have been possible without the political will which the opposition began to show at last during the middle of last year,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The opposition has taken on a new role for itself, one that is quite difficult psychologically. Up to now its main strength was negative, resisting the system, criticizing all and everything.'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Now, in the conditions of legal activity it has to clearly formulate its program, speak out with concrete ideas, be in full view, consistently, become an object of evaluation and criticism,'' it said. `` It is one thing to be able to destroy, instigate strikes and interfere with reforms, and something else entirely to create, to assist in the framework of general responsibility, positive processes,'' it said. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said it still was not clear whether Solidarity was inclined to cooperate with authorities. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported the agreement in an English-language news broadcast, but only an alert listener could realize that Solidarity's legal status had been restored. The news report said Solidarity had taken part in the negotiations and they produced a number of political agreements, including one `` which states trade union pluralism.'' The announcer said the participants also agreed on `` establishment of a two-chamber parliament and the post of a president with broad powers.'' It did not mention that the parliament would be the result of the first democratic elections since World War II. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said only the talks involving <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had ended and gave no further details of the agreement.

But the court cleared way for a hearing that could lead to <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s freedom, and Chief Justice <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON> named retired Judge <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> of Sebring to conduct the hearing. The order Wednesday relinquished the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s jurisdiction over the case `` It all means we are at last unblocking the clogged up pipeline and we are now going to get some action,'' said <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s attorneys. `` This may be the beginning of the end.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was convicted only of killing the oldest of the children, an 8-year-old stepdaughter, and sentenced to die in the electric chair. His sentence was commuted to life in prison after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down the death penalty in 1972. An investigation ordered by the governor's office concluded last month that the prosecution withheld vital evidence from the defense, and Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> determined <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> received an unfair trial. The children died after eating a lunch tainted with a pesticide. The lunch was served by a neighbor who was babysitting while <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and his wife were working in an orange grove.

 Leftist guerrillas today attacked the 4th army brigade headquarters and the headquarters of army engineers. At least six people died and 10 were wounded, authorities said. Col. <PERSON> Ciro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Roque </PERSON>, commander of the 4th brigade in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said three soldiers and three guerrillas were killed in the pre-dawn attack. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said five soldiers were wounded. He said the rebels did not penetrate the brigade's perimeter but that several of their mortars landed inside. The rebel's clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION> said the attack lasted two hours and was `` a success.'' It did not mention casualties. Guerrilla troops also attacked the headquarters of the military engineers in <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>, 35 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Canjura </PERSON>, post commander, said five civilians were wounded when homemade guerrilla artillery fell short of the military installation. He said there were no military casualties. Both he and <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> spoke in telephone interviews with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. An air force helicopter and an O-2 `` push-and-pull'' reconnaissance aircraft fitted with machine guns and rockets for air support attacked retreating guerrilla forces on the slopes of <LOCATION> Chinchontepec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Volcano </LOCATION> north of the city, witnesses said. In another development, a man who identified himself as an urban guerrilla of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> called the local <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> radio station Wednesday to claim responsibility for the assassination on Tuesday of a police officer in the capital. The caller, who claimed to speak for the <ORGANIZATION> Juan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commandos </ORGANIZATION>, said the group `` would remain vigilant'' to the actions of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, judges and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in connection with a case implicating military men and businessmen in an early 1980s kidnap-for-profit ring. The caller said guerrillas `` would take the appropriate action'' if they found anyone acting in support of those implicated in the rightist ring. One of the suspects was freed Friday on orders of an outgoing judge. The order was overturned Monday by the judge's successor. The suspects in the case are friends and associates of <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, founder of the Alliance, which is known by its Spanish acronym, <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>. The rebels have waged a nine-year war against the U.S.-supported government. More than 70,000 Salvadorans, most of them civilians, have been killed. They have stepped up attacks recently to protest the recent election of right-wing businessman <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> to the presidency. They threatened to present <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> with `` an ungovernable country'' when he takes office June 1. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> was the candidate of Arena in the March 19 election.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> hopped from his limousine outside <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abbey </LOCATION> on Thursday to chat and shake hands with cheering onlookers who had waited 90 minutes in the cold rain to see him. `` I was the first person to shake his hand,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggarty </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` This is the best day in my entire life. He's a hero.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sent his security men dashing in all directions when he decided, apparently on impluse, to stop his motorcade only a few yards from the abbey's <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Door </LOCATION> and greet about a dozen people in the crowd of several hundred waiting across the street. Many were encouraging him with shouts of `` Mikhail!'' <PERSON> Haggarty </PERSON>, 23, said he studied the Soviet leader's schedule for his 40-hour visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and concluded the only opportunity <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would have to meet the people would be after laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. `` I think he must really know that we love him,'' <PERSON> Haggarty </PERSON> said. `` What he's doing is so wonderful. He's trying to create peace in the world. He has to be treated like the hero he is.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, also spoke with <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Croydon </LOCATION> on the southern outskirts of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and told the 13-year-old: `` Thank you very much for the reception.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, who was with his mother, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON>, said: `` I never expected him to come over as there were so many police around. He was already in his car but he got out and came across. I am thrilled. It will be something to tell my school friends.'' In a 15-minute ceremony inside the 900-year-old abbey, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and two Soviet soldiers laid the wreath of red carnations on the tomb containing the remains of an uknown British soldier killed in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in World War I. `` This has been a very significant event here,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told a Soviet journalist.

The dean of <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abbey </LOCATION>, the Very Rev. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayne </PERSON>, welcomed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying: `` All those who long for the day when the barriers of fear and injustice which divide nations are no more, greatly welcome and admire what you have already achieved by way of perestroika together with the new openness in international affairs.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mayne </ORGANIZATION> prayed for peace and for the victims of December's earthquake <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> canceled his trip to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in December when the earthquake struck.

 The amount of TV commercials aimed at children has increased dramatically since the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration lifted regulations on such advertising, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was told today at a hearing on a bill that would reimpose restrictions on kids' TV programs. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., said that the three major television networks had steadily increased the number of minutes per hour of advertising in children's TV shows from below the 9.5-minute limit established by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 to as much as 11 minutes per hour today `` Prior to 1984 when the commission enforced commercial guidelines all these networks were either at or below the 9.5 minutes per hour limit,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said. `` However, in the five short years since the commission deregulation order, commercial time has been on the rise with stations at two of the networks now offering as many as 11 minutes per hour of commercial matter.'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said the government must stem the `` endless streams'' of TV commercials on children's shows because broadcasters are not regulating themselves. But the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertisers </ORGANIZATION> disagreed at a hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee. <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> said the bill before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and a companion measure before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> were unconstitutional and may not actually achieve the goal of improving the quality and quantity of children's programming. <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> said less advertising may lead to worse programs for kids and that `` program producers must have the flexibility to determine how best to balance the entertainment needs of the audience with the financial requirements of good programming.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, D-Kan., a co-sponsor of the bill, lashed out at the broadcasting representatives at the hearing and told them that `` about 80 percent of network programming is unmitigated crap and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. He challenged them to name a single children's TV program they could be proud of, saying they were `` miserably failing'' at what he said was an obligation to provide quality children's TV shows. He said the bill that is being considered, which would impose a limit of 10.5 minutes of advertising per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays for kid's shows, was `` just piddling on the margins'' and will not affect responsible broadcasters `` one iota.'' <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON> said he did n't want to paint all broadcasters with the same brush. He said some are responsible but that `` suggestions that the marketplace is going to take care of all these things is, Mr. Helm, naive.'' On Wednesday, Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the legislation was designed to stem the `` crass commercialization'' of children's television, where the constant din of cereal, toy and candy ads `` is enough to make any child's _ and any parent's _ head pound and stomach ache.'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, a main author of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, said it was his intent `` that stations which fail to provide a reasonable amount of quality programming with strict advertising limits specifically for children should not only be in jeopardy of losing, but actually lose, their licenses at renewal.'' The legislation would require the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to consider how well a broadcaster has been committed to the educational and informational needs of children in its overall programming. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed an indentical bill last year, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed it. A number of co-sponsors spoke at a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> news conference and said the proposal was `` modest'' and would not harm `` responsible broadcasters.'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said the bills were adopted in cooperation with the three major television networks, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>. `` This legislation is needed to ensure that broadcasters treat children as consumers of information and new ideas, not just consumers of candy, cereal and toys,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said. The bill was introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by Reps. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, D-Ill., and had 14 co-sponsors The bill has wide support from psychiatric, health and educational groups, and has been a 20-year focus of <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Charren </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charren </PERSON>, who introduced each lawmaker at the news conference, said the bill would impose on broadcasters the `` three Rs of television: restriction, requirement and reporting.'' <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON>, the ranking Republican on the telecommunications and finance subcommittee, noted that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 had determined that `` ` basic fairness' for children ought to be observed by noting ` a clear separation ... between program content' and commercials.'' `` It is only in the last few years _ since the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s deregulation order in 1984 _ that the assumptions underlying our bill have come into question.

<TEXT>
 Almost 30 years ago, a young Australian who loved American country music died in a car accident in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, leaving behind 2,000 old 78s and boxes of correspondence with the pioneers who had made the records. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> never made it to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but his collection did _ as he directed in his will. His legacy forms the nucleus of the Southern Folklife Collection that opened this week at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` In the past 20 years, historians have begun to look more and more toward folklife materials,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, an archivist of the collection. `` They're looking to sound recordings to provide a perspective on on the history of the South.'' In 1983, <ORGANIZATION> UNC </ORGANIZATION> bought the Edwards collection from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where it had been greatly expanded by acquisitions of more recordings and documents. UNC combined the purchase with the <ORGANIZATION> UNC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Folklore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> to form the Southern Folklife Collection. With 38,000 items dating to 1906, the collection is being touted as one of the nation's three top resources for country music research, joining the <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Music is highly symbolic,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, chairman of the folklore curriculum at <ORGANIZATION> UNC </ORGANIZATION>. `` It encodes deep statements about your identity. It speaks of values that are woven into your life.'' The collection includes gospel, spirituals, blues, bluegrass, Cajun, ballads, native American, string band and country music _ everything from sermons recorded at a Primitive Baptist church to the Skillet Lickers' recording of the fiddle tune `` Cotton-Eyed Joe'' to <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>' `` I'm Sick And Tired Of You, Little Darling.'' Researchers, musicians and other visitors also have access to books, videotapes and scrapbooks. Booths are available for listening to the tapes, and there's a sound studio to erase many of the flaws on old recordings. The people who have gathered in <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> through Saturday to mark the opening of the collection include musicians and the researchers and music professionals who have documented their lives. A concert Friday night will feature performers such as <PERSON> Etta </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a blues guitarist; <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Mainer </PERSON>, who in the 1920s was one of the first stars of country music; and <PERSON> Esteban </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a Texan who calls himself the `` <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> of the accordion.'' Another scheduled proformer is <PERSON> Y </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngong </PERSON> <PERSON> Knul </PERSON>, a 67-year-old from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> now living in <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> who performs a ritualized form of chanting. He symbolizes a musical direction that may be part of the traditional Southern music of tomorrow. `` There's starting to be a number of new ethnic groups moving into the South who have not been recorded as of yet,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. `` They're Hispanic and they're Vietnamese ... and they're playing their music. `` It's clearly not what what we've consider Southern traditional music up till now,'' he said. `` But the fact is ... in the next 100 years, it will be, and it's important to document it.''

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s official media on Thursday warned <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> not to arrest a dissident clergyman who secretly visited the communist country for talks on reunifying the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government `` should know clearly what consequences ... its foolish scheme to arrest and punish Rev. Moon Ik-hwan -LRB- will -RRB- bring on its lot,'' said a commentary in the Workers -LRB- Communist -RRB- Party newspaper <PERSON> Rodong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinmun </PERSON>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Wednesday threatened to break off an already fractured dialogue with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> is arrested when he returns home from an unauthorized, nine-day visit to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, an adviser to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s main dissident <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, arrived Wednesday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and said he plans to return home by April 14. His visit, the first by a South Korean dissident, broke regulations requiring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> to obtain government permission before they travel to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. South Koreans were angered by televised scenes of Moon hugging North Korean leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, whom they blame for the 1950-53 Korean War. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was divided at the end of World War II in 1945. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials say <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> helped <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> discredit their government's authority. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> he went to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> to contribute to unification through non-governmental contacts. But he also said he met only communist leaders and some of his relatives living in the north. <PERSON> Rodong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinmun </PERSON> said: `` As Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON> already stated, his <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> visit this time was aimed at deepening trust between the people in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, jointly seeking a reasonable way of reunification and promoting peace.'' <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s arrest would `` deliberately aggravate North-South relations and lay a new obstacle in the way,'' it said. The nations are involved in a variety of contacts ranging from a possible non-aggression pact to trade and cultural exchanges. Some have stalled over North Korean protests about recently concluded U.S.-South Korean military exercises.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to extend for one year the economic sanctions President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> imposed on the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government controlled by military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, an administration source said today. The current economic, trade and military sanctions expire on April 8. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to act as early as today or Friday to keep them in place for year. In the package that is currently being prepared for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signature, the sanctions remain the same as the ones already in place `` After the election we'll take a look at the situation there and see if there's any cause for change,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The sanctions imposed under executive order by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a year ago involve restrictions on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses who have developed a flourishing business with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, as well as a cutoff of military aid to the Central American nation. The sanctions include blocking assets of the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and prohibiting tax payments by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organizations to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime. The administration is closely looking to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s upcoming elections which are scheduled for May 7. It is anticipated that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is accused in a federal drug running case in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, will control the process because he controls the electoral tribunal and the media that otherwise might provide opposition candidates a better chance to get their messages out. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> is de facto ruler of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` If the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people have a chance to express their will in a free and open manner, we're confident <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will go,'' said the source, who acknowledged however, that prospects for that appeared rocky. The military promised the opposition Authentic Panamanian Party that the elections will be clean. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> parties, has <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> as its presidential candidate. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader since February 1988, when he orchestrated the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. The president had tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as military leader after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denied the charges. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> continues to recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as president and imposed economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said today it will expand service to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> by 24 flights a day by June 1, filling gaps left by strike-crippled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. American had said late last year it would expand in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but the strike pushed its planning schedule ahead. `` Obviously the opportunity that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s problem presented brought us to take a look at the timing of that plan,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s senior vice president for operations. `` It was probably a year down the road. The <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> part was closer than that.'' American will add 600 employees in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The airline's expanded presence will represent another $ 100 million a year to the local economy. The growth in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> will add 3,219 seats a day to the market. New routes from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> will include nonstop flights to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. New service to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> will include stops in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Santo </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Port-Au-Prince </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> additions will link 14 cities served by American with the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> hub in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> is expanding its daily service from 20 to 31 flights a day. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, the number of daily flights will rise from 45 to 52. Eastern service represented about a quarter of the seats from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and about a third of the seats to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> before the strike. `` None of what we have announced today will rise and fall on what happens to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> or anyone else,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Eastern's been in a lot of -LRB- the cities -RRB-. They've been a big guy here.'' `` The likelihood is that Eastern will still be the largest carrier'' in the region, he added. American is upgrading its fleet, switching to larger aircraft on 12 flights to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to increase its capacity. Direct service from other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> is part of the airline's plan.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will build a school in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to replace one of the many lost in December's earthquake, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said Thursday after talks with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The school, which will be designed to withstand earthquakes, will be built for 400 children between age six and 16 in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, one of the towns hardest hit by the Dec. 7 earthquake. Signing memoranda of understanding with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> announced `` the gift of a school to the people of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> who suffered so much in the earthquake. `` As you probably know, 5,000 children were killed ... during that earthquake and of course thousands and thousands were left without schools,'' she said. `` When we asked the people of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> what they would like as a gift, they said a school,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said following more than two hours of talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. She and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the papers in front of several industrialists whose companies, along with a charity called Aid <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, financed the project. Upon his departure from Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s official residence, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters he wanted to thank the British `` for reaching out to the people of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> ... in those days -LRB- after the earthquake -RRB-.'' `` That tragic situation also showed that we can be together, that we can work together when there is understanding, where there is trust, when there is a good atmosphere in relations between the two nations,'' he said. Work on the school is to begin next month and it is to be completed by the 1990-91 school year. It will cost about $ 7 million, said an education spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` I am delighted that British skills and technology are being used in this way to the benefit of the people hit by this terrible disaster,'' said Education Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s top military court has overturned a lower court decision and freed 19 policemen and soldiers implicated in the slayings of 14 fishermen on the border with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. A lawyer for the families of the victims called Wednesday's decision `` inconceivable. The Oct. 29 slayings had prompted four days of student riots in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and elsewhere in which news reports said at least one person was killed and at least 57 were wounded. Church groups and human rights organizations worldwide sent letters of protest to the government. The soldiers had claimed the fishermen had been Colombian guerrillas killed in a firefight, but nearby villagers and two survivors of the attack denied the claim and said the fishermen were ambushed while on a Sunday picnic. An autopsy showed that many of the dead men had been shot in the back of the head at close range. The court president, Gen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON>, said his tribunal had decided Wednesday to overturn a lower military court's previous decision in January to jail the men, part of a military-police border task force A lawyer for the families of the dead men, <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON>, criticized the ruling. `` There is an unmasked intention on the part of the court to favor the men on trial, which goes to show that in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> there are obstacles and structures that make justice impossible,'' <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON> told reporters outside the judge's chambers. The 19 policemen and soldiers had been held in the city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristobal </LOCATION>, about 400 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. The lower military court had ordered their arrest and reversed another court that had ordered the arrest of two surviving fishermen for `` military rebellion.'' The two survivors, <PERSON> Wolmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinilla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, then fled to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where they received political asylum. Villagers of <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Amparo </PERSON> denied the men were guerrillas, and said they were all fishermen out for a Sunday picnic when they were ambushed by the soldiers. The military court's latest decision frees the imprisoned men and sends the case back to where it stood before the decision to imprison them, said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. It was unclear whether <PERSON> Pinilla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who later returned to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, would now be guilty of `` military rebellion'' and liable for arrest again. Military rebellion is often a term used to justify detaining people without charges, according to the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. The decision follows widespread riots in February over government economic reforms that left at least 270 dead by official estimates. Unofficial sources say that death toll was as high as 2,000.

<HEAD>Employers' Group Calls For Importation of Labor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federation of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> employers urged the government Thursday to import foreign laborers to ease <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s acute labor shortage The group, called the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said it was essential to import contract laborers to avoid inflation and falling economic competitiveness. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> needs about 50,000 imported workers, most of them unskilled, to help fill an estimated 200,000 job vacancies, it said. The group's chairman, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>, an executive at <ORGANIZATION> Jardine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matheson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said there was danger <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> could lose it `` competitiveness in the manufacturing sector, the hotel industry and elsewhere'' because of the shortage of workers. The government said Tuesday it is considering easing restrictions on employment of foreign laborers. Under current policy, only foreign workers with skills not available locally are allowed to work in the colony. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s low unemployment rate, currently 1.3 percent, is considered a key factor behind the economy's growth slowing to an expected 6 percent this year, less than half the 1987 rate. The labor shortage is due to tight immigration laws and a steady drain of talent as the colony approaches its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The report said the government should encourage automation and productivity through tax breaks and reducing red tape. It said bringing in workers on six-month to two-year contracts, similar to practices in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, would provide relief. The group also suggested the possibility of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> using workers who would commute daily from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Grant Will Help Veterans Pay Living Expenses While Under Treatment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Until now, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans who came here to be treated for post-traumatic stress disorder were likely to encounter another kind of stress _ figuring out how to pay for living expenses during their seven-week stay. That's about to change. The Mid-Rio Grande chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has been awarded more than $ 100,000 to help veterans and their families from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> pay rent and food costs while they are treated at an outpatient clinic at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> hopes to serve about 70 veterans and their families during the one-year project, said <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> chapter's administrator of emergency services and disaster programs. `` I want it to be the tip of the iceberg kind of thing, where it could be increased,'' said Mrs. Waters, who hopes the grant will be renewed. `` We can reach them and help them into this -LRB- treatment -RRB- program that they would not be able to take part in if they had to worry about paying the rent or that basic kind of thing,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> was one of eight agencies nationwide awarded Agent Orange Class Assistance grants totaling more than $ 581,000 to help them serve <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and their families. The March 30 awards were the first disbursements to service agencies from the settlement of a 1978 lawsuit against seven manufacturers of Agent Orange. In their class-action lawsuit, veterans alleged they got cancer and other illnesses because of exposure to the defoliant used by the military in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> in the 1960s. The $ 240 million settlement, upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last year, provides $ 170 million to be paid directly to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veterans or their survivors; $ 52 million to agencies that serve veterans and their families; plus lesser amounts for veterans of other countries who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and for legal and administrative fees. The grants to service agencies were designed to reach veterans and their families who do not meet the eligibility requirements for direct payments, which are reserved for disabled veterans. The grants are not limited to agencies that treat Agent Orange-related problems. The $ 52 million fund for agencies is expected to grow with interest to $ 70million over the seven - to 10-year life of the program Mrs. Waters said the idea for rental and food assistance came because veterans from outside <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> contacted the local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> for money to pay living expenses while in the city seeking treatment. `` It's been in my mind for a couple of years because we helped veterans when we could from <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> funding when they were here for the program,'' she said. `` They came and said they were taking part in the program and did n't have any more money for rent or gas or food.'' She said the grant `` really was a godsend'' because the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> was n't able to meet all the needs of the veterans it heard from. The chapter applied for $ 102,000 based on an estimate of veterans in the clinic and the chapter's experience in paying rent and food costs for homeless people, Ms. Waters said. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> treatment program, said she expects the grant will increase the number of veterans in the program from outside the <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> area. `` A major problem with any guys coming in from anywhere was the need for them to commute daily,'' she said. The clinic, which began operating in 1987, combines individual and group psychotherapy. Staff members try to avoid using medication because chemicals are only an artificial way of dealing with anxiety, <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said. `` We directly address the patient's traumatic experience, bring back that event to the patient, then work through the feelings they've suppressed for the last 20 years,'' she said. The program, which she described as `` fairly intense,'' also includes counseling for married couples, anger management, problem solving and social skills, <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said. The clinic has treated about 150 veterans and can handle 85 to 100 a year, she said.

 The fired captain of the Exxon Valdez walked out of jail today after a judge reduced his bail from $ 1 million to $ 25,000, calling the higher amount `` unconstitutionally excessive.'' Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> posted bail, walked out of the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail at 12:59 p.m. and got into a waiting car with attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> and another lawyer. He did not speak and showed no emotion as he walked off. On Wednesday, another judge set bail for <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> at $ 1 million bond or $ 500,000 cash, comparing the effect of the oil tanker wreck in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to the atomic bombing of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>. Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, the supervising judge of <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Criminal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, today reduced the bail to $ 25,000 bond or cash. `` The amount of bail is not commensurate with the seriousness of the crime or the effect of the crime on the community,'' <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said of the figure that had shocked even prosecutors. `` We ca n't take out our wrath on one individual,'' said District Attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, whose office originally had requested $ 25,000 bail. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who faces three misdemeanor charges in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, is accused of being drunk when he relinquished command of the Exxon Valdez to an uncertified seaman. The vessel then hit a reef March 24, gushing 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and creating <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s worst oil spill. Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohl </PERSON>, a naturalist who comes from a family of professional seamen, set <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s bail Wednesday at $ 1 million bond or $ 500,000 cash. `` These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been equaled, at least in this country,'' <PERSON> Rohl </PERSON> said. `` He's got to think about that. We have a man-made destruction that has not been equaled, probably, since <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> at the end of World War II killed or injured nearly 130,000 people and leveled 90 percent of the Japanese city. No human life has been lost in the oil spill. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Guaneli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s assistant attorney general, said the bail order `` expresses the nation's outrage at what has happened.'' A pale, shaken <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, whose lawyer had sought $ 5,000 cash bail, was led from <PERSON> Rohl </PERSON>'s courtroom in handcuffs after his arraignment on the fugitive warrant. `` It was tough for our client to hear,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalos </PERSON>. `` It was very harsh, we thought.'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was taken to the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. He was granted 30 days to prepare for an extradition hearing. Authorities in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> have charged him with operating a ship while drunk, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. He faces 2 \ years in prison if convicted <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> last week after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said tests taken about nine hours after the Good Friday disaster showed he was under the influence of alcohol. <PERSON> Rohl </PERSON> said that even though <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> faces only misdemeanors, `` We are not talking about someone breaking someone's windshield. We are talking about a global catastrophe.'' <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> said his client was no fugitive because `` he left <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> before any charges had been filed against him.'' `` No one is saying this is not a tragedy,'' <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> said, but added: `` Captain <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> is not guilty of these crimes. He did not commit any criminal acts in this affair.'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who had shaven off his beard, appeared pale and despondent after the judge's tongue-lashing. When officers put handcuffs on him his hands were sweating and shaking.

 Many taxpayers are having trouble giving up lucrative deductions that were repealed or curtailed by the 1986 tax overhaul. A spot check by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of returns filed last year and early this year shows evidence of widespread non-compliance with parts of the new law. These include limitations on writing off investment and personal interest, on miscellaneous deductions such as union dues and on the treatment of rental losses. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> made the disclosure in announcing Thursday that it has broadened efforts to gauge how well taxpayers understand and comply with the new law. `` Recognizing that the 1986 act represents the most comprehensive change to the federal tax system in a quarter century and contained changes affecting almost every taxpayer, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will use the studies to assist taxpayers to better understand the new laws and help determine to what extent taxpayers are trying to circumvent various provisions of the new law,'' the agency said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is so concerned about public reaction to the new law that it has set up teams in each of its 10 regional service centers to spot check returns as they are filed. Without such checks, the agency would have to wait until 1991 for comprehensive information from a sizable number of returns. A check of several thousand returns filed in 1988, the first year affected significantly by the new law, disclosed that many taxpayers did not follow tougher rules on treatment of losses from passive investments, rental losses, investment interest expenses and miscellaneous itemized deductions. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, head of audit planning for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, said those issues were chosen as targets of the new effort because they involve large amounts of revenue, show up on many returns and were all changed significantly by the 1986 law. The first of about 150,000 returns filed this year that are expected to undergo spot checks show those same errors are being repeated. In addition, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said in an interview, many returns being filed this year attempted to avoid the reduction in the writeoff of consumer interest, in the deduction for business-related meals and entertainment and in depreciation of automobiles. In the past, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> generally would discover such non-compliance only through a formal audit, which usually would come about two years after a return was filed. With the new effort, the agency hopes to spot trends of non-compliance early and follow quickly with a campaign to educate the public. If the effort is successful, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> expects to see fewer taxpayers making these mistakes and fewer returns being audited on those issues. `` We want to fix as many of these things as we can without doing audits on people,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. `` If we can do these as part of -LRB- returns -RRB- processing, that's what we want to do.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has not yet estimated how much money is being lost by the government because of non-compliance with the 1986 tax changes. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said the spot checks are likely to find numerous cases in which taxpayers cheated themselves by misreading parts of the new law. Those taxpayers will be notified, he emphasized. Information from the spot checks will be used to determine whether the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> needs to change its tax forms, instructions or publications to clear up confusion resulting from the law changes, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>1989 Predicted Worst Year Yet For Soviet Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is facing its toughest year yet and could degenerate into `` economic chaos'' without urgent reforms, a newspaper said Thursday. `` The bony hand of hunger for products is quite capable of strangling perestroika,'' the Soviet program of economic restructuring, journalist <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON> wrote in a front-page article in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>. By putting off painful reforms, economists are ruining the chances for those reforms to succeed, said <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON>, who specializes in economic affairs. He cited the need to deal urgently with the Soviet budget deficit and shortages of consumer goods. <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON>'s calls for more rapid economic change have appeared in other top journals. The sooner real reform is introduced the better, `` because otherwise we'll have to be introducing economic reform under the conditions of economic chaos,'' he said. The government could have begun raising prices on plentiful, easily substituted items, but it is too late because virtually everything is in short supply, he said. An institute on consumer demand found that 211 food products, only 23 could be bought freely, he said. The rest require connections with the sellers, overpayment or are rationed. Strategists promise tough reforms after an initial period of heightened output of consumer goods, but there is no reason to expect any such increase, <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON> said. `` On the contrary, one can expect that the year 1989 will be the most unsuccessful of all those we have lived through,'' he said. Along with the announced budget deficit of $ 58 billion and an additional $ 102 billion in loans to state enterprises that are losing money, the unexpected expense of earthquakes in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION> will cripple the 1989 economy even further, <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON> said. He said inflation is running at 4 percent to 5 percent annually, much higher than official figures. `` Today we have to choose between only two realities: either relatively stable prices with minor inflation of about 6 percent and empty shelves, or quickly rising prices and goods in the stores,'' he said. <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON>'s prescriptions for fixing the economy included cuts in military spending, which he placed at nearly 20 percent of national income, and two or three years of importing giant stocks of goods from the West. The imports could be sold at 10 times their cost and thus both help to balance the state budget and satisfy consumer demand, <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON> proposed. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other leaders have said they oppose such massive imports, preferring to spend money on modernizing industry instead.

<HEAD>Former Teamsters Official Tells Congress Of Mob Corruption</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A former official of a Teamsters local in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that area crime families controlled union activities and finances with repeated acts of intimidation and violence, including an attempt to murder him. `` I had two choices, to be a dead man or talk to the feds,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Giliberti </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel reviewing government efforts to rid labor unions of corruption. <PERSON> Giliberti </PERSON>, a former vice president of Teamsters Local 814 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, has since shortly after the attempt on his life in 1982 cooperated with authorities, including testimony at a federal trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that resulted in the convictions of 12 reputed members and associates of the <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> crime family. Local 814 is one of four union locals the government has placed under court trusteeship through the use of federal racketeering laws, the subject of the review of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on Investigations. Those trustees and a fifth appointed to oversee a multimillion-dollar <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> fish market that allegedly was controlled by the Genovese crime family told the subcommittee the procedure has proven successful in rooting out corruption although all said those efforts were far from completed. <PERSON> Giliberti </PERSON> said he helped arrange mob backing of a candidate for president of Local 814 and later won <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> approval to force out that man, <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiello </PERSON>, and replace him as president with <PERSON> Vinnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracco </PERSON>. <PERSON> Giliberti </PERSON> said among his many jobs with the union was `` shaking down'' businesses, generally through promising them favors from the local in return for 5 percent of the company's profits. Among the favors was allowing companies to hire non-union workers or to hire union workers `` off the books'' so the employer could avoid payments to union pension and welfare funds, he said. <PERSON> Giliberti </PERSON> was shot outside his home in July 1982 and, after recovering, began cooperating with investigators. He sat behind a screen while testifying to the subcommittee, visible only to members and staff. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON>, appointed trustee of Local 814 in 1987 following the convictions of several of the union's board members for labor racketeering, said the financial condition of the local's pension, welfare and benefit funds has improved dramatically since he took control of the union's activities `` I believe RICO trusteeships can help carry out the public policy commitment to rid labor organizations of criminal infiltration and control,'' <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> said. Concurring in that opinion was <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stier </PERSON>, trustee of Teamsters Local 560 in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, which was placed under trusteeship in 1986 after a trial featuring lengthy testimony detailing the control of the Provenzano crime family over the local. The subcommittee earlier this week heard from Teamsrers President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who said he had never had dealings with organized crime. The hearings are to conclude next week with testimony from <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials concerning the appropriateness of court intervention in union affairs.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave his qualified support today to a proposal by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to hold elections among Palestinian Arabs as a step toward a settlement in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposed any outcome in which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might retain land it won in the 1967 Six-Day War. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> `` we do not support an independent Palestinian state, nor <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sovereignty over or permanent occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was confident an `` acceptable formula'' could be devised for conducting elections in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, territory <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has held since 1967. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes elections in the territories can be designed to contribute to a political process of dialogue and negotiations,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after meeting with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> for a little more than an hour. But a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had agreed on a principle, not any arrangement for conducting the elections. `` These are principles for moving forward,'' the official told reporters under rules that barred identifying him. `` Everyone recognizes more needs to be done ... to put meat on the bones.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal for elections was the main idea he brought here as a way resolving the conflict on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> where Palestinians have been in rebellion for 15 -LCB- months. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will need the cooperation of the Palestinians in devising the electoral process, which he said would be followed by negotiations for `` a permanent agreement'' on the Palestinian issue. `` In order to launch a political negotiating process,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said, `` we propose free democratic elections, free from an atmopshere of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> violence, terror and intimidation, among the Palestinian Arabs of <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>,'' he said, using the Hebrew references to the territories. `` Their purpose is to produce a delegation to negotiate an interim period of self-government administration.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking first, said `` the status quo serves the interests of no one.'' He pledged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance in the search for a settlement which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said must be based on direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arabs. The president, for the second time this week, insisted on an end to what he called <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the territories. He also said he did not support establishment of an independent Palestinian state. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to engage in `` a serious dialogue'' with Palestinians, but did not say if he wanted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which claims to represent the 1.4 million who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the goal of the elections he proposed was `` coexistence and cooperation'' between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> as a means to an overall settlement. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prime minister met for a second time today with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> before outlining for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his proposals for dealing with the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. Earlier, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s ideas were shrouded in secrecy. He had hinted before arriving here that he was inclined to call elections. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> agreed at their first meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday not to disclose the substance of the prime minister's proposals until after the White House meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Meanwhile, an aide to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the prime minister objected to any suggestions that elections be held under international supervision. The aide, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rejected the idea of foreign oversight of elections during his talks here on Wednesday. <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said the subject of supervision had come up in discussions <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had with Secretary of Commerce <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> and Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> paraphrased <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as saying, `` We do n't need this. ... We are a country that has experience in handling democratic elections.'' The aide said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposed, as an alternative to elections, having <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> chose the Palestinian reprepresentatives. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, the prime minister's media adviser, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had decided `` not to reveal anything.'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> did say that a group of Israeli and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had convened to explore the ideas in advance of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s talk with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, said if <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> holds elections without the participation of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, it `` will be a grave mistake; it will not solve the problem.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' show, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should tell <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> that `` land for peace is the main principle for proceeding forward in the peace process.'' Declaring that `` courage and good will'' were needed for achieving peace in the region, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has done lots of courageous steps for peace. ... I think it's the turn of the Israelis to make a courageous step.'' The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader refuses to negotiate with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization, which he blames for terrorism against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and protests by Palestinians on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> So far, 419 Palestinian Arabs and 18 Israelis have been killed in 15 -LCB- months of disturbances in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election proposition is designed to have the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> elect representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the basis of the 1978 Camp David agreements reached with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auspices. The agreements produced an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979 and called also for five years of local autonomy for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> after which negotiations would determine their future and that of the territories captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, after meeting with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, described their talk as `` very productive, useful and very friendly.'' For his part, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he had offered `` some ways to solve'' problems in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> and remarked: `` I feel we have started a very serious discussion. Our conversation was very friendly.'' There were widespread expectations before <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would take a tough stance toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday said he supports an eventual end to the Israeli occupation, and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday under rules of anonymity, predicted a `` candid'' discussion, a diplomatic way of forecasting division. But <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> told reporters afterward, `` I did n't see any hardening of position.'' The Israeli spokesman said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> wanted to move carefully, and that while the Palestinian problem was severe, for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> a bigger problem `` is our relationship with the Arab world.'' Except for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, none of the Arab countries is officially at peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The threat of a war, the threat of an explosion, comes mainly from that situation,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said.

 Lawmakers from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pronounced themselves fit and ready Thursday for a charity tennis contest May 19 at which organizers said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may put in an appearance. `` You'll see tennis played like never before,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., said at a news conference here `` We are a mean, lean and fit machine.'' `` We will show no mercy once we're on the courts,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannam </PERSON>, a conservative member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION>, said through a telephone hookup from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` We've been training here in the shadows of Wimbledon.'' `` I hope the Anglo-U.S. relationship will survive this ordeal,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. The play will be held in connection with the Dow World Senior Open for players over 45, sceduled for May 15 to 21 at <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. A contribution will be made to <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in the name of the winning team. The country club is also making a $ 5,000 donation to the hospital through a contribution from <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>, sponsor of the tounament, officials of the tournament said. Each team will consist of eight lawmakers and two guests, and play will include five doubles matches between congressional and parliamentary competitors. The first team to win 13 sets will be declared winner of the Congress-Parliament Challenge Cup and will receive a trophy from the archives of Wimbledon, officials said. <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, the captain of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team, said members tentatively scheduled to play include <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>; Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the 1988 Democratic vice presidential nominee; Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo. Although he listed only Democrats, he said he is still rounding up players and hopes to have some Republicans. He said he has also been talking to the White House and thinks it likely that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be on hand. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> said the British team will include the Marquis of Reading, the Earl of <LOCATION> Kinnoul </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bletso </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Abortion Advocates Converging on Capital as High Court Weighs Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration pushing the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn its landmark abortion decision, abortion advocates are converging on the nation's capital this weekend for what they expect will be their largest demonstration. They believe the stakes are higher than any time since the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion and are determined to pick up the gauntlet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has thrown down. `` We have been silent far too long,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Tens of thousands of students from 500 college campuses are coming, mothers are bringing their daughters and granddaughters, a delegation from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> will be there and dozens of celebrities are flying in from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> for the Sunday march, organizers say. The goal is to make the weekend a turning point in the national abortion debate. Organizers feel that anti-abortion advocates have so far carried the day by focusing the question on when life begins. Instead, they feel the issue is whether the government should intervene in what they believe should be a private decision. `` Nobody likes abortion. It's a difficult choice and there are a lot of issues that women have to weigh when faced with a crisis pregnancy,'' <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said. `` Women do n't have abortions they want, they have abortions they need.'' Organizers are reluctant to predict how many will turn out for the demonstration, but they expect the number will be far larger than the 90,000 who gathered for a March 1986 pro-abortion rally in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. At least one anti-abortion group plans to mount a counterdemonstration of up to 300 people on the day of the march. The engine revving the weekend's events is the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and its pending decision on a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case that could reverse or severely limit the high court's 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision that legalized abortion. Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for later this month. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration also pushed to overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> and failed. But since the issue last came before the court, two new justices have been seated and Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, a key defender of the 1973 decision, has retired. Of the newcomers, Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> is thought to favor overturning or curtailing the decision. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s views on the ruling are not known, but some observers think there may now be a one-vote majority for changing the law `` Women have felt abortion always would be legal, but now that it's clear there's a clear and present danger, they're responding,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority The message of the march is directed at the nine justices who will decide the case, and who organizers say are not immune to public opinion. `` They understand public opinion. Everyone is influenced by public opinion,'' said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the outcry and protest is loud enough and big enough, they'll hear it.'' The marchers also intend to send a message of disapproval to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who as one of his first acts as president in January addressed by telephone an anti-abortion rally of about 67,000 outside the White House. `` He has thrown down the gauntlet,'' <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said. Plans for the demonstration include a march at noon on Sunday from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument down the Mall to the Capitol. On Monday, abortion activists intend to take their message directly to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and to legislators in states across the country. About 50 celebrities and entertainers are scheduled to participate, including singer <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and actresses <PERSON> Cybill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstyn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tyne </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON>. Since the 1986 march, the number of endorsing organizations has doubled to more than 400 and the number of college campuses has also doubled. `` It's going to reshape the debate on abortion,'' <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON> said. `` Until now, everybody said the other side -LRB- anti-abortion -RRB- is a minority but is stronger and has more political clout. You ca n't say that any more We're going to show a tremendous outpouring of commitment and feeling.'' Organizers hope they've been able to transmit the depth of that feeling from an older to a younger generation, from the veterans of the battle to legalize abortion to the young women who will have to live with the outcome of the present debate. `` The women who went through illegal abortions are going to make sure it does n't happen to their daughters or granddaughters,'' <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> faces pressure from some members of his own party to resign to halt damage to the party from a stock-profiteering scandal, politicians and news reports said Thursday. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who acknowledged receiving nearly $ 400,000 in political contributions from the company at the center of the scandal, has vowed to remain in power despite opposition calls for his resignation and public opinion polls that show as few as 9 percent of Japanese support his government. The news reports said Thursday about 40 influential members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have decided to form the faction, which demands all those linked to the scandal _ including party leaders _ step down. `` The situation has reached a critical stage,'' they quoted <PERSON> Shizuka </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamei </PERSON>, a leading member of the group, as saying. `` The present <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is not capable of carrying out self-purification.'' The group also demands the government call former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> for questioning by legislators on possible links with the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information conglomerate that allegedly used stock bargains to seek favors. Opposition parties are boycotting parliamentary deliberations on the budget, which began Saturday, to back their demands for <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s testimony. On Wednesday, a group of 41 junior party members formed a faction to demand the government push political reforms. `` Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> should accept the guilt and take appropriate measures to satisfy the people,'' said faction leader <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>. `` Public distrust toward politics can not be easily erased.'' Some Liberal Democrats have withdrawn from the party, saying endorsement by the party, which has dominated Japanese politics for most of the postwar era, now would hurt their chances to win elections. `` Junior politicians ... can lose their political careers unless the administration takes drastic measures immediately to restore public support toward the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>,'' said one governing party politician Thursday. The member spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and party Secretary-General <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> have been linked to the scandal, and another party leader, former Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, was one of three <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers who resigned because of links to Recruit. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> have denied personal wrongdoing. Prosecutors have arrested 14 bureaucrats and businessmen on bribery and securities law violation charges. Recruit sold bargain-priced unlisted shares in a subsidiary to about 150 influential people, who reaped large profits when public trading in the stock began and it rose rapidly in value. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> suffered another blow Wednesday with reports, which he later confirmed, that Recruit contributed $ 382,000 to two <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> fund-raising parties in May 1987, six months before he became prime minister. His Liberal Democrats hold 297 of the 512 seats in parliament's lower house, and 143 of the 252 in the upper house Elections for half of the upper house seats must be held this summer, and a series of setbacks in local elections early this year has worried upper house party candidates. A 3 percent sales tax that took effect Saturday, along with cuts in income taxes and some other taxes, also has contributed to the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> government's unpopularity in the polls.

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Grows By $4.22 Billion in February</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans took out $ 4.22 billion more in consumer debt than they paid off in February, the slowest pace of growth in four months, the government said Thursday in a report consistent with other signs the economy may be slowing. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the February increase in consumer credit was down slightly from January's rise of $ 4.37 billion and was the smallest monthly gain since a $ 3.91 billion increase in October. Growth in the category of debt that includes credit cards strengthened in February, while the gain in auto loans was slightly smaller than in January. Borrowing through bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate also slowed while mobile home lending declined. Analysts said the restrained growth in debt indicates consumers may be becoming more cautious about their buying plans and is in line with other signs that the economy is slowing down in the seventh year of its record peacetime expansion. `` It does n't suggest any great retrenchment by consumers but it does indicate somewhat more caution,'' said economist <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` It's consistent with this gradually accumulating evidence that the economy is beginning to cool off.'' Consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of economic health because it accounts for two-thirds of economic activity. Most government reports on the economy's performance in February pointed downward, although 1989 began with strong momentum. Analysts expect the economy to slow this year as the recovery ages and the nation responds to a yearlong campaign by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to push up interest rates to restrain growth and keep inflation in check. February's 7.5 percent rise in the seasonally adjusted annual rate of credit growth was down from 7.9 percent in January and 7.8 percent in December. For all of 1988, consumer debt rose 8.75 percent. Auto loans rose $ 2.1 billion in February, an 8.6 percent annual rate of growth, following a $ 2.13 billion increase during January. Automobile sales have been weak this year, with business held down by rising interest rates. Automakers in recent weeks have launched a new round of cash rebates and low-interest financing programs in an effort to boost sales and avoid large production cutbacks. Growth in the category of debt that includes credit cards rose $ 1.6 billion in February, a 10.3 percent annual rate of growth. That followed a January increase of $ 1.02 billion, a 6.6 percent annual rate. Mobile home debts dropped $ 59 million in February, a 2.8 percent rate of decline, after rising $ 50 million in January. Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by $ 569 million in February, a 4.1 percent rate of growth, after rising $ 1.17 billion in January. The various changes left total consumer debt at a seasonally adjusted $ 674.78 billion in February, up 8.1 percent from a year earlier.

<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s strong-willed leader since 1978, on Thursday announced his intention to retire after elections to be held by September. His party had made clear it wanted a new president. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, whose grip on power began to loosen after a stroke in January, told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that an early general election will be held on an unspecified date within the next five months. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, 73, did not state explicitly that he would retire, but he said the outgoing president would hand over the official seal to a new president following the elections. The new president is expected to be Education Minister F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 2. Many Nationalists view de Klerk as more flexible than <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and more capable of breaking the country's black-white political stalemate. The state-controlled South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in a commentary to be broadcast Friday, said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> `` made it clear he did not intend to stand for another term.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> `` now enters the last months of a political career that has spanned more than a half-century,'' the commentary said. He has presided over the country's worst racial unrest and deepest international isolation but also its most ambitious race reforms and foreign policy initiatives, including plans for the independence of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he would dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in May and then set a date for the election. The voting is expected to take place between July 24 and Sept. 6 After the election, an electoral college dominated by the majority party in the white chamber of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racially separate Parliament _ virtually certain to be <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ will choose the new president. There would then be a ceremony `` where the seal of the republic would be handed over to him by the outgoing state president,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told a joint session of Parliament in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> grinned as he emerged from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> but told reporters: `` I have no statement to make.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> returned to work in March after spending eight weeks recuperating from his stroke while his official duties were carried out by an acting president, Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>. During <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s convalescence, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspapers and politicians began suggesting that the president make way for a new generation of leaders. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> declared he planned to stay in office until 1990, and the party's parliamentary caucus then adopted a resolution saying it wanted <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> to be president. The party lacked the constitutional power to force the president from office. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s term expires on Sept. 4, but he legally could have served until March 1990, the deadline for the next election. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, 53, said after becoming party leader that he sought a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` free of domination and oppression.'' However, he also reaffirmed the party's commitment to segregated schools and neighborhoods for whites who want them. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, the son of a farmer, left the university to become a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organizer in 1936. He entered <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1948, the year the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> came to power and began codifying apartheid legislation, and joined the Cabinet in 1961. He became head of the white-minority government in 1978 as prime minister. For several years he enjoyed a mandate among whites to maintain stability while moving away from rigid racial segregation. In 1984, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> helped push through a new constitution that brought Asians and mixed-race people into the previously all-white parliament. But the black majority continued to have no vote in national affairs. Black anger ignited two years of political violence in which an estimated 2,500 people died. The constitution abolished the post of prime minister, and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> became president. He was the first government leader to call for race reform and was credited with repealing apartheid laws that banned interracial marriages and required blacks to have a permit to be in whites-only areas. His reforms triggered a defection from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> by right-wing whites who opposed any concessions to blacks. But <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> refused to consider the possibility of black-majority government and insisted that whites retain segregated schools and neighborhoods.

 President-elect <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> says he represents rightists who think of themselves as modern conservatives, not exponents of their party's early neo-fascism As <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> meets President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday, many question whether his faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> is dominant and whether he can control reputedly sinister elements of the party. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> takes office June 1. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which gives <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> about $ 1.5 million a day in aid, has said it will keep a close watch on human rights abuses under the right-wing party, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>. Officials also have tied continued aid to an improved record. Even his antagonists consider <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> personally upstanding, and most accept his avowed commitment to furthering democracy in a nation ravaged by nine years of civil war. He was faced with an important test March 31. An outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge ruled that two military men and a landowner implicated in an kidnap-for-profit ring in the early 1980s were illegally detained and must be freed. All three, along with five fugitives absolved by the judge, were cronies of <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, a dismissed major of army intelligence who founded <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> in 1981 and retains great influence in it. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> acted decisively. He brought pressure to bear on the judiciary, got the judge's order revoked and kept two of the three suspects in jail. New arrest warrants were issued for the man released and for the five d'Aubuisson associates implicated in the ring. A ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy official said of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s first human rights test: `` He passed with flying colors.'' Critics of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> say <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, a wealthy landowner educated at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is a pseudo-democratic veneer on an apparatus linked to rightist death squads that killed tens of thousands of alleged leftists in the early 1980s. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s anthem, broadcast incessantly during the campaign, still says: `` <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> will be the tomb where the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> will all end up.'' The president-elect denies being a front man and says <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, who is an Arena legislator and leads the majority bloc in the unicameral legislature, will not have a post in the executive branch. `` There should be no doubt that it is I who will run the government,'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said after winning the March 19 election. He is 41, a coffee-grower, businessman and champion athlete who came late to politics and rose to prominence in Arena after <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON> lost the 1984 presidential election. `` Be assured that I entered politics only because of the country's grave crisis and am not motivated by personal ambition,'' he said in a radio advertisement during his campaign. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> campaigned on a platform of `` capitalism for the masses'' and an end to the civil war. He has said he is willing to talk with leftist rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, but `` we will not negotiate our political platform, or a share of power. We will not negotiate democracy.'' Monsignor <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, auxiliary archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said recently the Arena victory was likely `` to augment the level of violence, because they are advocates of escalation of the war.'' The new president's position is that he will offer the rebels terms for laying down arms and entering the democratic process, and will increase military pressure if they refuse. Rebel leaders say that amounts to a call for surrender. They say they will be the ones to intensify the war, showing the country to be ungovernable without their participation.

<HEAD>New Strides in Detecting Genetic Disorders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY SEDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors have discovered how to identify genetic defects in embryos as young as two days old, greatly reducing the need for aborting a abnormal fetus in later stages of pregnancy, researchers said Thursday. `` It is a wonderful move forward ... a scientific advance, a medical advance and an ethical advance,'' biologist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> told doctors from 42 nations at a conference on the test tube fertilization techniques. The new work by British and American scientists has developed screening techniques for sex-linked handicaps such as muscular dystrophy as well as some immunodeficiency and neurological disorders. It has preciptated the opening later this year of the first genetic screening programs using `` in vitro'' fertilization. They will be at <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bourne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hallan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hammersmith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a member of the British team responsible for the world's first test tube baby in 1978. The traditional screening method, amniocentesis, can be performed only in the second trimester of pregnancy. It involves removing a small amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus in the uterus. If a genetic disorder is found, the woman faces the often traumatic choice of abortion in the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy. `` Some women never get over a lost baby, especially when an abortion is performed after amniocentesis, when she has already felt it move and is heavily pregnant,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hammersmith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The new method allows doctors to study the genetic makeup of a 2-day-old embryo produced in a test tube. By removing a single cell of the embryo, then amplifying and copying specific gene sequences, scientists can identify defects. If the embryo is normal, it is implanted in the woman's uterus 24 hours later. `` Now you're seeing the breakthrough ... you've got the embryo right before you put it in. So they will know their pregnancy is right. That for me is marvelous,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. Among drawbacks is the low success rate of only one in five for test tube fertilizations. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> also cautioned the new method would not immediately eliminate the need for amniocentesis. `` In the early days of the work, we'd have to do amniocentesis to find out what our failure rate is,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> explained. `` We take an embryo and type it ... Then you type it with amniocentesis and say, yes it's a male and it's free of disease.'' But he added: `` Even if you're only 95 percent right, you reduce the amniocentesis abortions to just 5 percent of what we've got now.'' Among disorders the new technique can detect are absence of enzymes which lead to muscular dystrophy and a highly debilitating disease known as <PERSON> Lesch </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyhan </PERSON>, both of which affect males. Children with <PERSON> Lesch </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyhan </PERSON> are crippled and have to be restrained phsyically to prevent them mutilating themselves. A woman who carries a dominant gene for such inherited disorders has a 50 percent chance of passing on the defect, while a woman with a recessive gene has one in four chances of passing it on. <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> cited one woman who produced a child with <PERSON> Lesch </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyhan </PERSON>, then had five late-term abortions when amniocentesis detected the disorder. He said another woman's first marriage ended after two abortions of fetuses suffering muscular dystrophy. The woman since has aborted three more such fetuses.

Comments made over the last 26 years by the reclusive film star, who has n't made a movie since 1941, were recorded by a friend and published in a spring issue of Life magazine. `` If somebody gave me a million dollars I would n't write anything about myself,'' she was quoted as saying. `` I would n't do it for anything under the sun. I do n't think it's worthwhile. I do n't think it's very interesting. `` I do n't want any kind of attention from anybody, except that I know that someone likes me, and that's nice. Otherwise, it's sickening. The 84-year-old <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON>, who has an apartment in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, says she suffers from inertia. `` But to run from place to place is not what I'm looking for,'' she says. `` I ca n't take it. ... You have to show passports, and someone might say, ` Oh, that's the one who used to be in the movies.'''

<HEAD>Senate Celebrates Its First Two Centuries</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, told it `` is a guardian of tradition without becoming a barrier to change,'' celebrated its first two centuries of history on Thursday, recalling its faltering beginnings and noting its many milestones. April 6, 1789, was the date that the first <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, finally reached a quorum _ and thus was able to start conducting business _ after a frustrating month of failing to do so. `` History oozes from these walls,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, as the day of commemoration began in the Old Senate Chamber in the Capitol with the issuing of a postage stamp displaying the gilt shield and eagle still suspended over the presiding officer's chair The eagle and shield were there during speeches on the old chamber's floor which served the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from 1810 to 1859, and can be seen in 19th century prints involving three famous senators of the era: <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Those three senators and the roles they played in the period before the Civil War were invoked repeatedly as past and former senators hailed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as an institution. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader, said the sense of history in the old <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hall, and in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s present chamber first occupied in 1859, is so strong that at times one can truly `` smell the marble.'' Nearly 20 former senators _ including <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> _ joined senators in the current 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the ceremonies. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> celebrated the quorum bicentennial session of that body on Tuesday. Former Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, said that the legacy of the early <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is the art of the American political compromise. `` Today compromise is woven into constitutional fabric of the nation,'' <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> said. Although many senators past and present have regarded compromise as morally wrong, <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> said it is politically essential. `` Compromise, in my judgment, is getting a bad rap,'' <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> said. `` Without it we screech to a halt, paralyzed by intransigence.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> session began at 11 a.m., the hour of the first session two centuries ago. With the conclusion of the ceremony's first half in the old chamber, senators formed a procession to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s present meeting place down the hall. Senior senators from the states answered the roll call, beginning with <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, which became the first state in 1787, and continuing to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, which in 1959 became the 50th to join the union. When <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s name was called, Republican <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> gave this response: `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> was not the first state to be admitted, but it was the first to secede'' in 1860. After the Civil War, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> returned to the union in 1868. Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, noted <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s description of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as a stage, and recalled some of the drama the present chamber has witnessed, including the one-vote defeat of the attempt to oust President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> during Reconstruction after the Civil War, and the rejection of President <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s effort to bring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into the League of Nations after World War I. Senate Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said that while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has undergone many changes over the years, it remains a place where the rights of the minority are protected and speech can remain virtually unlimited. `` It is a guardian of tradition without becoming a barrier to change,'' he said. Senators moved in and out of the ceremonies to spirited <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON> marches played by the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> band. A tourist asked a doorman: `` Does a band play every day the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> meets?'' `` No,'' the doorman replied. `` Only once every 200 years.''

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> conducted overt intelligence at a high-tech factory Thursday, asking surprised workers not only about quality control but also whether they were happy and how much money they made. `` He even asked me my salary, which was a bit embarrassing because I think us English like to keep our salaries to ourselves,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 43-year-old worker at the <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> plant 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Although the British are often reserved, especially on the subject of money, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> presumably divulged the details. The plant's workers make an average of about $ 37,000 a year. On the only full day of his 40-hour visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the Soviet president paid a 40-minute visit to the 1,000-worker plant, arriving in an impressive 22-car motorcade. The highly automated factory designs and makes `` network systems'' that enable computers to talk to each other. The company said the Soviets invited themselves last week because <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would be interested in its technology and relaxed corporate culture. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was greeted outside at the company's main building by British Trade Secretary Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and company and local officials. Case Communications flew the Soviet flag for the occasion. Nearly 200 people braved cold drizzle and waited behind a police barricade across the street hoping to catch a glimpse of the Soviet leader. `` Keep up the good work,'' read one placard. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said after the visit: `` He was very interested in ways in which we are dealing with quality control. He showed an enormous curiosity and I think he will have found the visit extremely useful.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> talked to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a senior designer of printed circuit boards, with particular friendliness, and commented on their shared name. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, I know that name,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` He was a very friendly chap, I thought,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said later. `` He was more interested in my private life. He asked where I was educated, what sort of school I went to, where I lived, what size of house I had. He wanted to talk about my family, my wife and children, where they went to school.'' Employee <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, 42, told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> she had worked at the factory `` for six happy years.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> fixed her with a stare and said: `` Are you saying this because the bosses are listening?'' `` No, I really mean it,'' she said. `` Ah yes, I can see from your eyes,'' she said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> replied.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, testifying in his own defense, said today <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration superiors told him `` not to tell anybody'' about his role in funneling aid to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> North </PERSON> took the stand shortly after <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was identified in court as an intermediary in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s secret plan to aid the Contras. <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who faces a dozen charges in connection with his role in the Iran-Contra affair, said, `` I was particularly admonished'' to keep secret `` that another country was providing millions of dollars to help the Contras.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> supplied some $ 32 million in aid to the Contras, beginning in mid-1984. Asked by defense lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> who told him he was going to be running the operation, <PERSON> North </PERSON> identified then-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, his deputy <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. Under questioning from his lawyer, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide depicted himself as a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer with plans to take command of a battalion at Camp LeJeune when top officials in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration enlisted him to run the secret Contra operation in 1984. North testified in his own defense after his attorneys read into the record a lengthy account of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's efforts to keep alive the Contra struggle against the leftist government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The account, a legal `` admission of fact'' read to the jury with the agreement of the prosecution, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally told the president of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in 1985 that extra aid was being funneled to his country as payment for helping the Contras. The account also said a representative of <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> offered in a meeting with <PERSON> North </PERSON> to assassinate the Sandinista leadership in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. North was said to reply that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted no part of any such plans. Deputy White House press secretary <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, `` I have no comment'' on the developments, adding that `` this is part of an ongoing trial.'' A short while after the `` admission of fact'' statement was read, <PERSON> North </PERSON> was on the stand and fielding questions from his own attorney. `` Was there a time when you were stepping in'' to help the Contras, asked North lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` I was not stepping in, I was brought in,'' responded North. `` I was told not to tell anybody'' about his role in taking over from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in overseeing the Contras' needs, <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> objected when <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` understood'' that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had designated him as the Contras' new provider. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> sustained the objection and <PERSON> North </PERSON> did n't answer. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he ended up handling `` everything that had been coming from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Everything that they had, from the little tents that they lived in ... to food, to bullets, to intelligence'' had come from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> North </PERSON>. `` I do n't recall there was any specific break point'' when all the Contras' needs fell on his shoulders, but he was carrying the load by the time the cutoff in military aid went in effect in October 1984, <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified. North recalled how he went to <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> to get bank account numbers so he would know where money to the Contras was to be funneled and which factions of the splintered Contra movement to contact. Dressed in a dark suit, <PERSON> North </PERSON> sat down in the witness box seven weeks after a jury began hearing testimony in the case. `` So you're Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON>,'' his attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, began as the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide took the stand. `` Yes sir, I am,'' he replied with a smile. It was disclosed earlier in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> personally approved a secret deal early in 1985 to funnel $ 110 million in extra aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in exchange for that country's support for the Contras The deal with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was one of the quid pro quo arrangements whose details have emerged at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial showing how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> secretly enlisted the aid of other countries in support of the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had cut off military aid to the Contras. After <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved the assistance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, then vice president, told Honduran President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> `` that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had directed expedited delivery of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military items to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' said the statement read by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyer. `` Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also informed <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had directed that currently withheld economic assistance for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> should be released,'' said the statement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said `` that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would provide from its own military stocks critical security assistance items that had been ordered by Honduran armed forces; and that several security programs under way for <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> security forces would be enhanced,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s representative offered the assassinations in mid-1986 on behalf of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader `` in exchange for a promise'' from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government `` to help clean up <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s image,'' according to the statement. Also to be part of the deal, according to the statement, was the lifting of a ban by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government on military sales to the Panamian defense forces. After lengthy criminal investigations, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Feb. 4, 1988, for alleged involvement in international drug trafficking. <PERSON> North </PERSON> told the representative at the meeting that `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government could not be involved in assassinations,'' said the statement read by his lawyer. The Panamanian representative pointed out that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had helped the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the previous year `` in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal,'' the statement said. When <PERSON> North </PERSON> told his boss, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, of the Panamanian offer, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> responded, according to the statement, that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government `` could not be involved in assassination, but <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> assistance with sabatoge would be another story.'' <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> North </PERSON> speak with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> directly, it said. The prosecution said in a motion earlier that <PERSON> North </PERSON> should be compelled to produce his notebooks and ledgers if he testified. North chronicled his daily activities at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in a series of notebooks. He also kept a ledger of the use of travelers checks he received from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. <PERSON> North </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he destroyed the ledger but the prosecutors have been under orders not to read his immunized testimony. The government had issued a subpoena to produce the documents March 3, contingent on his testifying. Other information detailed in the statement read by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyer included: _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` urged'' the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> head of state in 1985 that the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> government `` continue its support'' for the Subsequently, the Saudis gave $ 25 million. _ In 1983, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> became involved in a secret effort known as Operation Tipped Kettle to persuade <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to make available weapons captured from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> discussed the matter with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>. _ The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> advised that it would use the weapons for various purposes Several hundred tons of the weapons were shipped to the Contras as congressionally appropriated funds to the rebels ran out. _ In 1984, under an operation known as Elephant Herd, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was to tell <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> it would be as flexible as posible within the constraints of the law `` to compensate'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with aid in exchange for the weapons it had gotten from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Earlier today, former hostage <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s eyes filled with tears following <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>'s release because other Americans held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> had not been released. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said that on a plane flight to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> <PERSON> North </PERSON> told <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> he was `` discouraged'' because the other hostages had n't been released and `` they ca n't enjoy the same'' happiness `` you are enjoying.

 The fired captain of the Exxon Valdez walked out of jail Thursday after winning reduction of the $ 1 million bond set by a judge who compared the tanker's oil spill to the <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> bombing. A stone-faced Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, walked past reporters without comment and climbed into a waiting <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> with his lawyers. A few hours earlier, a supervising state judge reduced his bail to $ 25,000 and called the $ 1 million figure `` unconstitutionally excessive.'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who was charged with being intoxicated when his tanker crashed into a reef on March 24, spent one night in jail. He turned himself in Wednesday, and state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohl </PERSON> set bail at $ 1 million bond or $ 500,000 cash. `` These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been equaled, at least in this country,'' said <PERSON> Rohl </PERSON>, who comes from a family of professional seamen. `` We have a man-made destruction that has not been equaled, probably, since <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>.'' Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, who heard the bond appeal, said there was little chance of <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> jumping bail and drastically cut it to the amount originally requested by prosecutors. `` The amount of bail is not commensurate with the seriousness of the crime or the affect of the crime on the community,'' said Stark after listening to an emotional appeal from <LOCATION> Hazelwood </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> has 30 days to prepare for an extradition hearing that would return him to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where he faces charges of operating a ship while intoxicated, reckless endangerment, and negligent discharge of oil. The charges carry a combined maximum penalty of 2 \ years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said tests taken about nine hours after the March 24 disaster showed he was under the influence of alcohol.

<TEXT>
 A resistance leader on Thursday called for an international conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> vowed to arm the guerrillas until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> fulfills its pledge to end its 10-year military intervention. Resistance leaders expressed skepticism over <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s promise Wednesday to withdraw its estimated 50,000 to 70,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by Sept. 30. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has been a major stumbling block to establishing relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and improving economic ties with non-communist Southeast Asian nations. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has also refused to resume normal relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as long as Vietnamese troops remain. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> next month for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Hanoi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed the Sept. 30 deadline and urged the international community to prevent the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime from regaining power. In December 1978, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ousted the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, under whose rule an estimated one-fourth of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 8 million people died from famine and execution since 1975. Fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest of three insurgent groups in Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s resistance coalition, would regain power has been a major stumbling block to a negotiated settlement. In a written statement from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> ruler, rejected `` all decisions, all conditions, and all accords'' announced by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> regarding <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to convene a conference including the five permanent <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members _ <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ as well as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, all Cambodian factions and the six members of the non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. He urged <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to pull out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> as soon as possible under supervision of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which would also supervise new elections. In a separate statement, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the main supplier to the insurgents, said it was `` entirely just'' to keep aiding them until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> makes good on its promise to withdraw. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s clandestine Voice of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the prince doubted the Vietnamese would carry out the withdrawal. The broadcast, monitored Thursday in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, also said <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> rejected <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s proposal that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> be invited to witness the pullout. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> meanwhile said it would sponsor a meeting between <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnam-backed prime minister, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, next month. A spokeswoman for <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said he planned to meet with <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> on May 2 in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>.

 The state's wildlife director was fired a week after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> officials charged him in an antelope trapping incident. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who held the post for two years, was dismissed Wednesday by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Several news stories have disclosed that <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> employees stocked fish and game on private lands belonging to politically powerful Texans, including state House Speaker <PERSON> Gib </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, an avid hunter, said Thursday that the controversy surrounding the department since February was unwarranted. `` I do have some friends around the country, and I called them to find out. The only reason that there was any cases brought -LRB- is -RRB- because of the press play that this has received back in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. The speaker maintains the animals in question remain public property and that anyone could take part in the stocking programs. He said the firing of <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> threatens destruction of `` one of the best parks and wildlife departments in the country.'' <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> was unavailable for comment Thursday, his secretary said, and he did n't immediately to return a call from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In a brief statement, he gave no reason for the firing. He also said that after reviewing a continuing internal investigation, `` It is my opinion that Mr. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> did not knowingly violate any criminal statute.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, 40, also could not be reached Thursday; there was no answer at his home phone. He has declared his innocence of three felony and six misdemeanor charges brought against him last week in <LOCATION> Alamagordo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> served as net gunner in a helicopter mission Jan. 30 to trap 40 antelope.

 Moslem guerrillas attacked <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and three other cities with rockets and missiles Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said, despite a cease-fire called by the government to mark the holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. It was the fifth time since January 1987 that President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has called a halt to hostilities. None has succeeded. A truck driver who said he was part of a convoy hauling fuel said guerrillas tried to hijack some of the trucks about six miles from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>. The hijackers got about a mile before being attacked by two government helicopters, said the driver, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the afternoon, a missile blew up a fuel truck parked near a petroleum tank depot on the northern edge of the capital. Several trucks parked nearby also exploded. There was no word on casualties from that attack or from reported bombardments in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sarobi </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said government troops withheld their fire in those three areas, despite rocket and cannon fire from guerrillas. The report could not be confirmed. The military command announced the cease-fire in a nationwide radio broadcast Wednesday night for <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, the Islamic holy month. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>, said his troops would retaliate with renewed force if the guerrillas broke the cease-fire. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said guerrillas fired 32 rockets and cannon rounds at the southern city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, where they have been besieging government forces for the past year. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said fewer than 100 rounds were fired at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. In the past two weeks, the government has accused the guerrillas of firing as many as 12,000 rounds a day at the city 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The spokesman said he had no indication how many rounds were fired at <LOCATION> Sarobi </LOCATION>, on the highway midway between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said only three of the seven Pakistan-based guerrilla factions were firing at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sarobi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>. He identified them as the factions led by <PERSON> Yunus </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gulbuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rasul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayyaf </PERSON> _ the most hard-line fundamentalists of guerrillas who have been trying for more than a decade to oust <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s Soviet-backed government. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 but withdrew the last of them in February under a U.N.-mediated accord. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said reports the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had named an envoy to Afghan rebels showed that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials planned to break relations with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and recognize a rebel government-in-exile. Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> told a news briefing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> continued to violate the agreement that led to the withdrawal of Soviet troops and were intentionally aggravating the situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Reports published in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Thursday said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, was appointed to represent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests to the rebel movement. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not want to extinguish the flames in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 National police reported their first confrontations with death squads and said Thursday they found documents showing the paramilitary groups are run by drug traffickers. Statements from two police generals said officers killed 10 gunmen and seized 8,800 pounds of cocaine and cocaine paste in two encounters. In another development, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it would permit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to install radar in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to track drug-running aircraft. Gen. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> said documents found Tuesday in a raid on a traffickers' hideout in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> established that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and British mercenaries had been training drug traffickers in use of weapons. He said one gunman was killed 10 were arrested in the raid. Witnesses identified three of those arrested as participants in the assassination Feb. 27 of <PERSON> Teofilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Forero </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, the general said. About 700 members of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> have been killed since it was formed four years ago. Until this week, no one connected with the government had indicated there were any clues to who was behind the killings. The same group is suspected in an attack at the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> airport March 3 in which four men firing submachine guns killed <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antequera </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> executive committee, <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> said. A bodyguard also was killed and eight people were wounded. Documents seized in the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> raid showed the death squad to be run by <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, who the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says is among <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s main drug traffickers, the general said. A statement by Gen. <PERSON> Octavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said the other encounter with a death squad, also on Tuesday, occurred near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> village 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Anti-narcotics police were fired upon as they approached a cocaine laboratory in the jungle and returned the fire, killing nine drug traffickers and capturing three, he said. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said four officers were wounded. Police found 6,600 pounds of cocaine ready to be shipped and 2,200 pounds of paste, the general said. He said documents found at the drug lab connected the men with a death squad run by <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities say he runs the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>, which smuggles 80 percent of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Last year, Fortune magazine described <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> as a billionaire and among the world's 20 richest men. Fifteen years ago, he was a pickpocket and car thief in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. The radar agreement signed by the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> military and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was disclosed in a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> news release. One radar unit will be on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION>, an island about 500 miles north of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast, and the other in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle of southern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, it said. The ministry said the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> air force would operate the radars. Although the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andres </LOCATION> radar would be only about 125 miles off <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the ministry said it would not be used to monitor Nicaraguan air traffic. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said Colombian cocaine has been flown to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> en route to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Scientists Say Beef Industry Responding to Consumer Demands for Less
Fat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumers prefer less fat in their steaks and hamburger, and the beef industry has responded well to those demands, two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M University scientists said Thursday. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Savell </PERSON> said further progress can be expected in the future as attention continues to be drawn to health issues, notably the dietary linkage between fats and high levels of blood cholesterol. But <PERSON> Savell </PERSON> told a conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION>'s Association that if he had to send cattle producers and the beef industry a note from the teacher, it might say: `` Excellent progress made in making product fit consumers' needs. Keep working on leanness, convenience and cost, value. Remember to maintain taste, or consumers will go elsewhere.'' The beef industry drew praise from <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, who agreed that less fat is being sold to consumers. `` I think they have done more than many other industries to recognize the dangers of excessive fat consumption and take steps to inform consumers about that,'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. But selling meat is also a business, he said, and `` the beef industry wants to recover its market share; they have lost it steadily to chicken and poultry in general over the past 10 years.'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said that occurred `` largely because of consumer perception of beef as a high-fat food.'' It was just a year ago that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> released a study by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M, led by <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Savell </PERSON>, that showed the trimmable fat on retail cuts of beef had been reduced 27 percent in two years. The $ 45,000 study, paid for by the beef industry and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, showed that the average thickness of fat on steaks and roasts from primal cuts, or the major wholesale cuts of beef, was 0.14 inch, while the average for all cuts, from chuck roast to stew meat, was 0.11 inch, or less than one-eighth of an inch. Most retailers have been using a quarter-inch beef fat trim, or less, since 1985, compared with a standard of half an inch before that, according to the industry. At the conference, <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said consumers have indicated they would pay for more closely trimmed beef, preferably with external fat of less than one-eighth inch. Internal fat, or marbling, has been a factor in the taste of beef, and <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said this still is important to consumers. The challenge, he said, is take fat off, not out of beef. Cross said that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M meat scientists are currently working with human medicine researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on projects aimed at further improvements in the healthfulness of beef. The work includes modification of the fatty acid content of meat product through changes in cattle feeds and products themselves. Fatty acids can potentially elevate cholesterol levels in human blood. But <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said that even now, only 27 percent of the total fat in beef is the type of saturated fatty acid that can raise cholesterol. <PERSON> Savell </PERSON> told of recent research on the composition of cooked as well as raw beef with reduced or no external fat. For example, if a slice of beef with all the fat trimmed off is cooked, the fat content of the interior meat is reduced by 20 percent from a slice with a quarter-inch layer of fat. That is because less fat migrates from the outside into the meat tissue. `` When you trim the fat off a steak that has a half inch of fat, you get rid of half the total cholesterol,'' <PERSON> Savell </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Syrian and Christian gunners dueled with mortars and rockets across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Thursday, shattering a short-lived cease-fire and forcing panicked civilians back to basements and bunkers. Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian army claimed its troops held their fire. Police said 15 people were wounded, bringing the toll to 177 people killed and 591 wounded since March 8, when Christian troops clashed with an alliance of Syrian army and Druse militia forces. Police said Syrian gunners fired 50 rockets and mortar rounds against the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> enclave east and northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, starting 11 -LCB- hours after the cease-fire was called at midnight. A police spokesman, who can not be identified in line with standing rules, said a dozen mortar rounds fired from east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> slammed into residential districts of Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. One Soviet-designed Grad rocket struck the Greek Orthodox church of <LOCATION> St </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nicholas </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Ashrafiyeh </LOCATION> district, destroying its furnishings. The church was empty when hit, the spokesman said. Christian-controlled television showed rescuers trying to salvage icons and other valuable objects from heaps of rubble in the church, built in the 19th century. A police spokesman said the Christians kept the peace for nearly three hours after the bombardment began. Then west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was shelled from `` emplacements in -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.'' `` It is difficult to say who mans the guns: the army or the Lebanese -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militia -RRB- Forces,'' said the spokesman, who customarily is not identified by name. A telephone operator at Lebanese Forces headquarters said spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdelmasih </PERSON> was not available to answer questions. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s spokesman insisted, `` The army is not responding to the Syrian provocation.'' Thursday's truce was called by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, who heads a six-nation <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We appeal to all the warring Lebanese parties to observe a cease-fire as of midnight Wednesday,'' <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, where he met Thursday with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> left for home later, saying he had not heard from <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> but thought the cease-fire was accepted by most Lebanese leaders. As the deadly duel resumed, civilians who had emerged from bomb shelters to stockpile food and assess damage rushed for refuge in building entrances. Several motorists in the crowded Christian suburb of <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> deserted their vehicles. Others honked their horns hysterically, racing their cars in all directions and causing several accidents. Vendors in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> scurried away from their vegetables stands in <LOCATION> Ein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mirreiseh </LOCATION> district as mortars exploded nearby. `` Peace did n't last for long. This is God's wrath at us,'' said a woman carrying bread. She hurried along west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hamra </LOCATION> street as shopkeepers lowered their shutters. The latest violence erupted after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal militia-run ports to reinstate tax collection worth $ 100 million a year at government harbors along <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 130-mile <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast. In retaliation, militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and their <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> allies besieged the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the capital. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who also leads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, has demanded <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> be a full party to a cease-fire, claiming its soldiers are the main adversary to his 20,000 troops. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> keeps 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate. Syrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharaa </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is `` strongly boosting'' the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s cease-fire appeal. `` <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> maintains and supports this appeal ... for our Lebanese brothers to accept a cease-fire and lift the siege,'' he said. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, welcomed the cease-fire and urged `` all sides to comply with the proposed truce out of mercy for the battered population.'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, does not control a militia and the 22,000-strong predominantly Moslem troops of Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> have not been involved in the clashes. The dual government, which threatens to cement <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s partition into sectarian cantons, emerged last September after parliament failed to elect a successor to outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>

<HEAD>Bush Names Special Envoy to Afghan Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, bowing to congressional pressure, has chosen <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON> as a special envoy to the Afghan rebels battling the Soviet-backed regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, administration sources said Thursday. <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON>, the deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, has not formally been selected, but sources who spoke on condition they not be identified by name confirmed he was the choice of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The move stops short of offering formal recognition of the Afghan government-in-exile, but it is seen as a means of broadening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence among the long-feuding rebel factions and curbing <PERSON> Paskistan </PERSON>'s clout. The post carries the rank of ambassador. <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON> will be based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and travel frequently to the region, said an administration official who spoke on the condition he not be identified. The name has not formally been announced because it `` has n't been put through all the administrative hoops yet,'' said the official. The move drew immediate criticism from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of `` plans to break off relations with the Afghan government'' and preparing to recognize a `` self-imposed government.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not want to extinguish the flames in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. They make every effort to topple the government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> said, repeating Soviet charges that the administration was failing to uphold the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords that oversaw the withdrawal of Soviet troops in February. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> closed its embassy in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> several weeks ago, as the situation in the city deteriorated after the Soviet pullout. Formal diplomatic ties were not broken, however. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, who confirmed the decision about the envoy had been named but refused to identify him, said the move did not entail a recognition of the rebel's government-in-exile or establish diplomatic relations with it Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, who pushed a law through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year requiring the appointment of such a special ambassador, said he was `` elated'' by the reported decision. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> acknowledged that he had backed an Afghan-born <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> scholar for the post, <PERSON> Zalmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalilzad </PERSON>, who is now a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, for the job. <PERSON> Khalilzad </PERSON> speaks <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s two languages, <LOCATION> Dari </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pashtu </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON> does not. But the senator said he was pleased that the administration appeared to be moving toward developing policy for dealing with the fluid situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and he hoped the move was a step toward the eventual recognition `` It does raise the credibility of the resistance,'' he said. The senator argued that the high-level posting was needed to curb <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s influence over the rebels, now that the Soviet troops have withdrawn from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the insurgents are battling the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s goals _ whatever they are in the region _ may not wholly be in agreement with our own. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs to take some new initiative ... we need a policy with momentum,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has funneled support to the rebels through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which has continued to back radical Moslem fundamentalist rebels over more moderate factions. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have privately expressed concerns about powerful resistance leaders who advocate restructuring Afghan society along strict Islamic fundamentalist lines.

 A government minister said Thursday the seven-year ban on Solidarity would be lifted immediately, and <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> urged supporters to put their `` political victory'' into action by organizing nationwide. `` The process of legalization of Solidarity should be completed between April 15 and April 20,'' said Sports Minister <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwasniewski </PERSON>, a chief negotiator for the communist government in two months of talks with the opposition that concluded Wednesday in a broad accord. <PERSON> Kwasniewski </PERSON> said the Sejm, or parliament, would meet Friday to enact the agreements on trade union freedoms, economic reforms and political changes, including creation of the first freely elected legislative body in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, looking relaxed at a news conference after a grueling week of negotiations, outlined the tasks his independent trade union faces. But he warned the agreement could lead to disaster if <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> failed to take advantage of the changes. `` The most important task for today is to write applications immediately all over the country to provincial governors and city mayors so we get the technical possibility to organize as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. The agreement allows Solidarity to organize on a national, regional and local level after parliament makes the necessary changes in the labor law to permit more than one legal trade union at a workplace. On the national level, the union plans to form an organizing committee as early as this weekend to apply for formal registration by submitting a new union charter in court, said top Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. `` Today we as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have a great victory, but a political victory _ a theoretical one which may turn out to be a victory or a disaster if we are not able to make use of it,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` If we are not able to work in the economic field to have more, produce more and better and in the political field to represent ourselves well ... nice slogans will only stay slogans,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. The government daily Rzeczpospolita called the agreements sealed by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, the interior minister, a breakthrough that created a chance that must not be wasted by `` false solutions, sham ambitions or ignorance of realities.'' <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON>, a Politburo member and participant in the talks, said the agreement was a step toward reforms undertaken by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but it would not solve all of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s problems `` These reforms have made the prospect of satisfying the working class much closer,'' <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON> said. `` In spite of what I said before, one should not expect that the agreement reached should eliminate all concerns and troubles.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appeared unconcerned by the apparent lack of reaction by Poles to the restoration of the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union, which claimed 10 million members and ignited that nation's spirit during its 16-month legal existence before being crushed under martial law in December 1981. `` I went on the hotel balcony today and watched people's behavior I met with great sympathy, almost everyone waved, but also with a lot of doubt,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. He said the union had trouble before with expectations that were too high, so today's skepticism is good. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he expected Solidarity to attract 5 million to 7 million members, but that he would like to see at least three competing trade unions. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and his advisers have said the shift in the attitude of the Polish leadership toward Solidarity is partially due to changes in the political climate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he would like to see what is happening in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for himself and added: `` I would not like to disturb perestroika and reforms. That country is reforming itself as far as we hear. ... We want to solve our -LRB- problems -RRB- and not disturb others.'' He later flew to his home in the port city of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where Solidarity was founded, and told reporters the union would like to use the Monopol Hotel in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> as its national headquarters. <PERSON> Kwasniewski </PERSON> said the government had urged local and regional authorities to support the registration process of new unions and provide them with office space. Authorities proposed the talks in August during the year's second nationwide wave of strikes When work stoppages appeared again this year, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appealed for calm to give the negotiations a chance. Both sides have expressed hope the solutions reached at the talks that began Feb. 6 will repair the economy and revive the dispirited population. In addition to Solidarity, authorities agreed to restore legal status to the farmers' union Rural Solidarity and the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, all banned during martial law. In exchange, the opposition agreed to participate in June elections to the 460-member Sejm that guarantee the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies a 65 percent majority. But at the same time, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will have its first democratic elections since World War II, creating a new 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. A presidency also will be created, to be elected by the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION>. The president would be elected this year for a six-year term and the post is expected to go to Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, due to his party's dominance in the larger Sejm.

<HEAD>3rd World Debt Falls Heavily on Children, Actress Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Third-world debt is imposing its heaviest burden on millions of children whose countries are cutting social programs to keep up payments loans from foreign banks, actress <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday. Accompanying declining spending by developing countries for health and education is a more alarming statistic, she said: the average weight-for-age figure is falling in many of the countries. `` In other words, ... the children of the developing world are paying for the Third World's $ 1.3 billion debt with their health, education and even their lives,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee. `` At least half a million young children have died in the last 12 months as a result of the slowing down or reversal of progress in the developing world,'' said <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, who is a `` goodwill ambassador'' for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund. <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, she said, is able to use its implicit trust to help alleviate those conditions in places such as the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, where aid to starving people has been stalled because of a civil war. `` Everybody trusts you because everybody loves a child,'' <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> said in response to a question from chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis. `` It's something everybody has in common ... Children may eventually be the cause of peace in these countries. What they need most is peace. But they ca n't wait and <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> is taking care of them.'' <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> is a perennial favorite on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where lawmakers have restored some $ 100 million in cuts proposed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over the last four years, according to the subcommittee's figures.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> on Thursday signed an agreement calling for increased cooperation in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, signing the classified document at <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, said the two countries had `` adopted ambitious proposals'' for combating crimes and terrorism. `` Our agreement expresses in unmistakable terms the strength of our partnership and the vigor of our commitment,'' he said in brief remarks. The agreement was worked out by two groups of American and Italian experts over three days of talks this week. The experts have been meeting regularly over the last five years to improve cooperation between the two countries. Italian Interior Minister <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gava </PERSON> said both sides had agreed they would have to be `` on a war footing'' in the fight against `` the international cancer'' of drugs, organized crime and terrorism. The projects undertaken by the two nations in their agreement include cooperation on extradition, on increasing the exchange of information about terrorist activities, on money laundering by drug traffickers, and on upgrading enforcement of racketeering laws, said an Italian source. He spoke on condition of anonymity. Specifics of the agreement were not divulged. <PERSON> Gava </PERSON>, addressing the experts earlier, said organized crime groups in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been increasing their cooperation in recent years. He also said a link between drug trafficking and terrorism was becoming apparent. He did not elaborate.

 A Common Pleas Court judge ruled Thursday that mob boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> `` Little Nicky'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and seven associates must be sentenced to life in prison instead of death for killing a gangster. Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> took the decision away from the jury on grounds that prosecutors failed to show sufficient aggravating circumstances for a death sentence to be imposed. Because only a jury can impose a death sentence, the eight men convicted in the 1985 slaying of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> `` Frankie Flowers'' <PERSON> D'Alfonso </PERSON> will automatically be sentenced to life in prison. Friends and relatives of the eight broke out in applause as the judge announced his decision. During the sentencing phase of the trial Thursday, city police firearms examiner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Finor </PERSON> testified bystanders were nearby when <PERSON> D'Alfonso </PERSON> was shot on a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> street corner. But <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> ruled that was not an aggravating circumstance necessary for the death penalty under <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law. The decision came a day after jurors convicted <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and the others of first-degree murder, conspiracy and the possession of an instrument of crime in the July 23, 1985, shooting of <PERSON> D'Alfonso </PERSON> near his home as he paused to light a cigarette. Government witnesses said <PERSON> D'Alfonso </PERSON> was murdered because he failed to show <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> proper respect as head of organized crime in the Philadelphia-southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, 60, already is serving a 14-year sentence in a $ 1 million extortion case and faces at least 40 more years in a federal racketeering case.

<HEAD>Administration Seeks to Encourage Implementation of Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is preparing a package of measures designed to encourage <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist authorities to implement democratic reforms they agreed to this week, officials said Thursday. The package, to be announced as early as Friday, would include economic and possibly political concessions to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said two administration officials who spoke on condition they not be identified. They declined to give specifics. A Polish government spokesman said it was asking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to give the green light to loans from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and from other Western governments. `` What we want does not lie in the bilateral range of things, not trade,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mierik </PERSON> <PERSON> Miernik </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s efforts to rebuild its shattered economy have been hampered by an inflation rate of between 60 and 100 percent, and a $ 39 billion foreign debt. The Polish government would like <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support in persuading the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of bankers and governments to reschedule repayment of the loans, <PERSON> Miernik </PERSON> said. Although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lifted the sanctions it imposed after communist authorities declared martial law in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1981, it has been pressuring Western banks and governments against extending new credits to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, he said. Forty congressmen have also urged the administration to influence the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> to relieve debt pressure on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The congressmen, including <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, said that with the reforms in place, `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> should maintain a primary position on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foreign policy agenda.'' `` Now that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> seems on the threshold of monumental reform, the struggle of the Polish people should not slip down on our list of priorities,'' said the letter initiated by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipinski </PERSON>, D-Ill. One step might be allowing the government's <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> to insure investments by Americans in Polish agriculture or other economic enterprises, said an aide to <PERSON> Lipinski </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and White House officials have been preparing a package of conciliatory measures for several weeks, with an eye to negotiations involving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist authorities, Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, representatives of the Roman Catholic church and others. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> concluded the talks and announced the accords on Wednesday. They include the first free elections since the communists took over <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after World War II and legalization of the Solidarity trade union after eight years of suppression. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts, who have scrutinized the agreement, said they were impressed its constitutional provisions. It creates a strong presidency, recreates an upper house of parliament, and eliminates over time the communists' guaranteed majority in the lower house of parliament, meaning they ultimately could lose control of the country, said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst who asked not to be identified. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Wednesday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hailed the `` accords that have started <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on this new path of reconciliation.'' `` We feel very confident about the process that is under way in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Now that we have these accords, we are considering issues or moves that might be taken which would, in various ways, foster economic development and help move that process forward.''

<HEAD>USDA Says It's Too Early For Drought Relief For Winter Wheat Growers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite pleas for help from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it was too early to advance a new drought relief package to aid winter wheat growers facing potential losses from dry weather and temperature extremes. `` We do n't know there is going to be a widespread disaster,'' <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for economics, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. Frustrated by the wait-and-see approach, a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> lawmaker introduced legislation to extend drought assistance approved last year by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to farmers of winter wheat planted in 1988. `` It is my people. We are suffering. We were able to work with corn country last year. It is our time,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., who represents a 58-county district considered one of the prime wheat-growing regions in the nation According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, the winter wheat outlook is bleak in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, traditionally the nation's largest producer. At the start of the month, 70 percent of the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> wheat crop was rated poor to very poor. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> normally accounts for 17 percent of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat production and 35 percent of the nation's hard red winter wheat, the main bread wheat. In testimony to the wheat, soybeans and feed grains subcommittee, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials conceded that drought could sharply reduce harvests in portions of the major winter wheat states of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. However, they held hope that spring rains could rescue part of the crop. <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief meterologist, said the next 30 to 60 days will be critical. He said the 90-day weather outlook suggested near-normal rainfall in much of the Wheat Belt across the the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, although below normal rainfall is expected in the short term. Because the winter wheat crop is developing later than usual this year, <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said, `` we have a mixed picture.'' `` It's just a little premature to start to write the crop down to any specific level,'' said <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON>. `` We simply have to watch and wait for the development and the timing and distribution of rainfall in the next two months.'' Lawmakers unsuccessfully pressed <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to support a new legislative relief package or extending the 1988 drought assistance programs to the 1989 wheat crop. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> `` does n't want to do anything precipitous.'' `` We will have to monitor the situation and see if it rains and see how bad it is,'' he said. For the major winter wheat states, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, 31 percent of the overall crop was rated poor to very poor compared to 8 percent last year at this time. According to a `` highly tentative'' projection by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, total 1989 wheat production could be about 2.45 billion bushels, a 35 percent boost from last year's drought-reduced harvest. At the hearing, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON>, a private agricultural analyst, estimated a harvest of 2.25-2 .3 billion bushels He warned that a poor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter wheat crop would drastically shrink already small grain stockpiles and pose `` a serious threat to world food sufficiency and price stability.''

 Representatives of Salvadoran rebels challenged the newly elected Arena party Thursday to declare its administration a `` government of transition'' or face a deepening of the nine-year-old war in the Central American country. <PERSON> Guadelupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said the proposal was being announced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because president-elect <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> is here for talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Altschul </PERSON>, a representative of the political opposition commission of the rebel group, said the proposal was presented Thursday to representatives of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> and other Salvadoran factions. He said he knew of no response. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has a news conference scheduled Friday morning and will meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the afternoon. Asked what would happen if <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> rejects the proposal, <PERSON> Altschul </PERSON> said, `` We hope it is not rejected. Unless there is a negotiated settlement of the war, there is only going to be an ungovernable country; there is only going to be a deepening of the war.'' Meanwhile in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> the leftist guerrillas attacked the 4th Army brigade headquarters and the headquarters of army engineers, authorities said. Three soldiers and three guerrillas were reported killed and 10 people wounded. More than 70,000 Salvadorans, most of them civilians, have been killed during the nine-year war against the U.S.-supported government. The rebels have stepped up attacks recently to protest the election of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, a right-wing businessman who was the candidate of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, in an election March 9. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> is scheduled to take office June 1. <PERSON> Altschul </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, named for its initials in Spanish, `` has made it very clear that it will follow a policy of massacres and total war and has given no indication of a serious disposition toward peace.'' He said the rebels would seek a response from <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> to demands that it stop assassinations, respect nationalization of banks and other steps taken by its predecessors and abandon its insistence that the guerrillas surrender. He said this would be `` a first step to start serious negotiations.'' `` In order to resolve the problem of the war in a definitive manner, it is necessary to revise the constitution and for the future <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> government to declare itself a government of transition,'' the proposal said. It called for elections in which the army would be confined to barracks and the rebel military forces also kept away from voting places for three days before, during and after the voting. It called for the rebel faction to `` participate directly as a political force in these elections with our flag and in coalition with other parties which may be disposed to participate together with us.'' It said that commanders and officers implicated in `` political crimes and massacres which have been causes of the war'' must be brought to justice. The rebels also demanded that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid be cut off and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisors withdrawn. Elections would be held within six months after initiation of a cease fire.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may order the military to help in the long-term cleanup of the massive oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, it was disclosed Thursday as the administration underscored its opposition to a federal takeover of the operation. `` There's a lot of military already in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, adding that those troops were the most likely to be tapped. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation had asked officials to consider using the military _ `` and we are.'' He said the armed forces could help in washing oil from animals and birds plus cleaning up rocks and shorelines and then continue in the long-term effort. Asked when the military might begin the work, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Beginning about now.'' He said a final decision was still pending. `` The concern is, we need a comprehensive way to deal with this continuing and long-term cleanup.'' The White House is under pressure to take charge of cleaning up the largest oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. `` We've got to have federal control now,'' Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> at the first of several congressional hearings on efforts to deal with the nation's worst oil tanker disaster. While <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was joined by other senators who suggested that the president order a greater federal involvement in the cleanup in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and Admiral <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, the commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, cautioned against turning control of the effort over to the federal government. `` I am not prepared to federalize this spill,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, adding that such a move might leave an opening for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> `` to close their checkbook'' and force the government to assume cleanup costs. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has just $ 3 million or so in the fund that would be used for such a task, only enough for a few days. That concern was not shared by <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who said that the government could still tap an industry disaster fund of up to $ 100 million to cover the costs and that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> likely would not be relieved of liabilities in any event. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was planning to assume greater direction over <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in deciding how to go about the cleanup, what equipment to use and what the priorities should be. `` We're going to do much more coordination and guidance,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said, acknowledging that <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> had asked for greater <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> involvement in a letter received Monday night. L.G. <PERSON> Rawls </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel that the petroleum giant `` will continue doing all we can to clean up and mitigate the spill's effects.'' `` We're chasing the oil. We're doing what we can,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> chief executive. Meanwhile, a group of Republican congressmen said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should become more directly involved in the matter and put a federal agency in overall charge of the effort. At a news conference called by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> said he has received offers from people willing to travel to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to help, but has not found any government agency that can provide information on what steps such volunteers should take. While the debate continued on what steps need to be taken to protect wildlife, fish and the ecology of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, officials agreed the early response to the March 24 accident in which the Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground, spilling more than 10 million gallons of oil, was largely bungled and probably was inadequate even if events had run more smoothly. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel the petroleum industry's emergency reaction plan and the environmental impact analysis in connection with the Alaskan pipeline did not contemplate such a massive spill. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said that while all is being done now that can be done to deal with the spill, the response on the first two days after the accident was inadequate. `` They had n't planned for a catstrophe of this magnitude,'' he told the senators. The contingency plan, for example, called for booms to be put around the stricken tanker within five hours, but the booms were not in place until 12 hours after the accident and then did not hold because of strong winds, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the basic response plan was faulty, noting that when it was developed the largest oil spill anticipated was 74,000 barrels The oil that gushed from the Exxon Valdez was more than three times that amount and came out at a rate of 50,000 barrels an hour, according to administration officials.

The nightly news program `` Vremya'' devoted more than 20 minutes to the visit and reported no disagreement with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> beyond <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s friendly correction of her estimate of how long they had talked. A commentary in the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, however, combined praise for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s recent statement that the Cold War is over with a review of issues that remain in contention. Columnists <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krivopalov </PERSON> and <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturua </PERSON> wrote that each side questions the other's performance on human rights. They said <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> bureau frequently has its attention called to <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> conduct in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and to allegedly unjust convictions by British courts. <PERSON> Krivopalov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sturua </PERSON> accused Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> foreign </ORGANIZATION> secretary, of `` playing political games.'' On the 40th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, they wrote, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> `` allowed himself remarks which clearly carry the flavor of the old days. He once again spoke about ` the Russian bear,' which he said represents a military threat to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>.'' In truth, they declared, recent polls indicate most Britons perceive the Soviet threat as much smaller since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> also said the growth of British-Soviet trade `` is restrained by discriminatory measures introduced by the British authorities on various Soviet products, by the ban on export to the U.S.S.R. of contemporary industrial equipment and the newest technology.'' Accompanying the complaint was an acknowledgment that the lethargic and ponderous Soviet financial system also is at fault. Despite their differences, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are part of a growing consensus that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> must coalesce into `` one general European home,'' the paper said, and expressed hope the Gorbachev-Thatcher meeting would bring progress toward that goal. Reports on state television and by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> covered the visit in detail, from the landing at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to a visit by the Soviet leader's wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> to <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s Cathedral <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> described Westminster Abbey, which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> toured Thursday afternoon, as `` a positive jewel of ancient English culture.'' In a report on his stop at a communications firm that does business with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the agency said `` British people are not yet satisfied'' with the rate of growth in trade between the two countries.

 The operator of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline terminal announced Thursday that it will immediately require random drug and alcohol testing on all vessels using the terminal. The action was one of several announced by <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of seven oil companies that owns and operates the Valdez terminal and the 800-mile pipeline. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> has been criticized for its slow response to the nation's worst oil spill. The tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> took on a load at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> on March 24 and hours later ran aground, releasing more than 10 million gallons of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The ship's captain, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, is charged with operating the vessel while drunk. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release that it would require tanker owners and operators to institute random drug and alcohol testing. It also said it would require tugboat escorts for all entering and departing vessels to a point beyond <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>, where the Exxon Valdez ran aground. The state this week drafted an emergency order that, if signed, would require <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> immediately to take several steps to correct problems with its oil-spill response program. Some of those steps, including the purchase of additional booms, dispersants and other cleanup equipment, were included in <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Thursday. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, commissioner of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to sign the order, Deputy Commissioner <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> said. The draft order sharply criticizes <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION>'s initial response to the spill, saying it failed to comply with its spill contingency plan and took too long to deploy equipment. The order says `` continued operation of <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION>'s marine terminal and tanker traffic at the current crude-oil flow rate creates a substantial risk of an additional oil spill'' in the sound. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> said a task force of oil company officials will make additional recommendations to improve spill response. `` We sincerely regret the environmental tragedy in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and pledge to do everything feasible to prevent another such accident from happening,'' the news release said. `` A painful lesson has been learned.''

<HEAD>Soviets Buy Corn; Chinese, Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been sold wheat at subsidized prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Officials said that the Soviet purchase was for 400,000 metric tons of corn to be delivered this year and that the wheat sale to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was for 300,000 tons. Both deliveries are scheduled for this year. More than 2.7 million tons have been purchased since the Soviets rsumed buying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn on March 28 after a layoff of almost three months. The latest sales brought total corn sold to the Soviets for 1988-89 to almost 13 million tons. Additionally, sales include 4 million tons of wheat, 450,000 tons of soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal and 507,400 tons of grain sorghum. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 400,000 tons of corn woud be about 15.8 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.45 per bushel at the farm level, according to the latest <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> five-day average, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 39 million. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddington </PERSON>, acting general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the wheat was part of 2 million tons authorized Feb. 27 for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in selected overseas markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. The latest sale boosted to about 8.5 million tons the amount of wheat sold to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for 1988-89 delivery under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reddington </PERSON> said the latest sales were handled by <ORGANIZATION> Garnac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Bunge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 100,000, and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 100,000 He said the wheat will carry an average subsidy rate of $ 6.33 per ton, or about 17 cents a bushel. About 910,000 tons are still available under the current authorization. The 300,000 tons of wheat would be about 11 million bushels and, at recent prices of about $ 3.96 per bushel, would have a farm value of around $ 44 million.

<TEXT>
 A novelist and former Oscar nominee jailed for stealing thousands of books from more than 70 libraries in two countries was released 88 days early so he could get back to work. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON>, 41, who co-wrote the screenplay for the 1987 film `` Full Metal Jacket,'' had become a `` high-profile prisoner and the subject of verbal abuse from other prisoners,'' said <PERSON> Orlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Donley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON>'s attorney. <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON> was released Tuesday, 28 days before he would have been eligible for parole and 88 days before he would have finished his six-month sentence. <PERSON> Donley </PERSON> told Judge <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obispo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON> had a chance to go to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to work on a movie based on a book he recently had published. Hasford is also working on a deal with a publisher for three more books, <PERSON> Donley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON>'s income depends on his writing and he ca n't write in jail because of the harassment, the attorney argued. <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON> said he released Hasford because the writer had a job, had agreed to pay restitution and agreed to let authorities determine which books belonged to him and which should be returned. Hasford can leave the state and country, but must report to his probation officer in writing, <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON> wrote `` The Short-Timers,'' based on his experience as a combat correspondent with the 1st Marine Division during the Tet Offensive of 1968. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubrick </PERSON> bought the rights to the book for `` Full Metal Jacket,'' in which Hasford shares screenwriting credit with <PERSON> Kubrick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Herr </PERSON>. The screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987, but the honor went to authors of `` The Last Emperor.'' About 10,000 books were confiscated when <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON> was arrested, but charges against <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON> focused only on 2,000 books valued at about $ 20,000. They were taken from public libraries in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>; and the city, county and university libraries in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>. Hasford pleaded no contest in January to possessing stolen property as part of a negotiated agreement with prosecutors, who dropped two criminal counts of grand theft. Police officers at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> have been storing the books since they were confiscated.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Endorses Ending Last Price Restraints</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted Thursday to end the remaining price controls on natural gas in 1993. A decade ago, the action of the energy and power subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would have followed battles between consuming and producing states. Memories of those battles led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and its committees to ignore the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's almost annual requests for removal of controls. Thursday, it took only 12 -LCB- minutes for the subcommittee to approve, by voice vote and without dissent, the bill sponsored by 22 of its 23 members. A previous decontrol episode in 1985 saw prices collapse, confounding predictions of a pocketbook-bashing `` fly-up'' of prices. Many analysts now believe gas prices are determined by oil prices because many industrial users can switch between the two. Most believe decontrol will have little immediate effect if demand does not increase as ceiling prices frequently are well above spot prices. The last major gas pricing battle in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> came in 1978, when harsh winters, diversion of gas into unregulated intrastate markets and soaring oil prices all combined to curtail gas deliveries to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and Northeast. To encourage new production, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted several different prices for gas according to source, such as tight sands or very deep wells, and permitted those prices to rise with inflation. It also provided that much of that gas would be decontrolled in 1985, as it was. But gas from existing wells was to remain under price controls. That gas is a smaller percentage of the supply every year and today is 25 percent to 30 percent of gas flowing through pipelines, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has declared that the ceiling price of certain gas could rise to the price of the most expensive category. That ceiling price, which rises with inflation, is now $ 2.79 per thousand cubic feet. The March average spot price in major producing states, according to the newsletter <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>, was $ 1.44. Some old gas is sold for 30 cents. The bill does not abrogate contracts. Some contracts provide for market pricing under decontrol but others do not.

 Astronaut <PERSON> Hoot </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was the best-known member of <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s class of'64 _ until Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was fired and then arrested for his role in the nation's biggest oil spill. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, released Thursday on $ 25,000 bail, is accused of being drunk on March 24 when his ship, the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, ripped its bottom open and ran aground just 25 miles from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, pouring more than 10 million gallons of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> had problems with alcohol, his life was otherwise as obscure as those of his other high school classmates. `` He was n't a wild kid. He was never in any trouble,'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifson </PERSON>, a member of the class of'64, told <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>. `` He is a very inconspicuous person.'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was raised in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> suburb, and still lives there with his wife and their daughter. He was one of four children; his father was a captain for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. During high school, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> participated in gymnastics and tennis. After graduation, he went to <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and left as a deck officer on June 5, 1968. Soon after, he began a career with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. By the time he was 31, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> had already received his master's license, permitting him to run a ship of any size. At the time of the oil spill, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was one of the youngest captains in the merchant marine, running one of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s newest tankers. After the spill, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> fired him. Ironically, while he held a lofty position on the water, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was barred from driving a car because of a drunken driving conviction. The first sign of his troubles with alcohol came on July 21, 1981, when <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was charged with driving while intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident. He later pleaded guilty and was fined $ 510. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was later sued by a seaman who alleged the captain had abused him over a period of several years, court papers showed. The lawsuit, still pending, does not detail the alleged abuse. In 1984, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s driving license was revoked after he refused a breath test following another car accident. He entered a state-required rehabilitation program as part of his sentence in that case. `` I do know that he had a problem with alcohol in the past. I know he was rehabilitated. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> knows it,'' said his mother, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>. His drivers license was restored in May 1986, but revoked again after a September 1988 drunken driving conviction in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Conway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hazelwood </LOCATION> is charged with operating a ship while drunk, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. The misdemeanors carry a maximum penalty of 2 \ years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine upon conviction

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> complained to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Thursday that a 2 -LCB- - month-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy review threatens the momentum of arms control talks, a Soviet spokesman said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered the review after he took office in January. It is still under way, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will not be `` stampeded'' by Soviet initiatives. `` In general we are not happy with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>'s answer _ or maybe non-answer _ to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> initiatives in the field of disarmament,'' Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told reporters after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> met for four hours. `` We understand that the new administration needs time to study foreign policy because there are new faces there and some of them do n't know what foreign policy is about,'' he said. But he said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> the Soviets `` do n't want this pause to become an interval which will lead to losing momentum in this process of disarmament. `` But still I think overall we must say that the atmosphere for disarmament talks is extremely favorable now,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. East-West negotiations began in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> last month on reducing conventional weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but U.S.-Soviet negotiations on reducing long-range nuclear weapons have been postponed indefinitely. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration aimed for a 50 percent reduction in strategic nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines. But an agreement was blocked by Soviet concerns over the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> and difficulties over verifying compliance with an accord. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not specifically ask Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, a staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, to take up the Soviet concerns with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We just expressed our concern,'' he said. Asked what the Soviets believed was causing the delay in formulating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said his view was that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was trying `` to please everybody.'' The Soviets also `` feel a certain influence'' of old <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> hands like former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> National Security advisor <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, `` who tend to interpret Soviet-American relations in terms of confrontation,'' he said.

 A group of Jewish radicals announced Thursday it would send its members to the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to defend Israeli settlers if Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> orders the pullout of his troops from the territories.

An estimated 70,000 Jews, many of them of American origin, live in small settlements among the 1.3 million Palestinian inhabitants of the territories. Israeli troops are charged with protecting the settlers, although most of them also have their own weapons and some have conducted vigilante activity against Palestinians. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shlomich </PERSON>, who identified himself as the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone call from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that his organization `` will not allow the settlers to be slaughtered by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> mobs and terrorists.''

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> review panel has recommended upholding <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s trading privileges with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, rejecting a suit filed by an Arab-American group, sources said Thursday. The ruling by the office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative has been submitted to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his approval and an announcement is expected next week, the agency said. A spokeswoman for the trade representative declined to discuss the panel's findings, but other officials said a complaint filed against Israeli labor practices by an the <LOCATION> American-Arab </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last year had been rejected. The committee, which lobbies for the rights of Arab-Americans, last year accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of violating international labor and union-protection laws for thousands of Palestinians who work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and in its occupied territories. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stood to lose trading privileges it enjoys under the General System of Preferences, which grants dozens of countries the right to export products to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> free of duties. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to investigate the complaint, along with petitions against <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and held hearings late last year. The trade panel found that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had taken steps in recent months to rectify some violations of workers' rights. The panel declined to rule on the complaint about Israeli practices in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, citing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of not recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s legal rights over the predominantly <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> land, said another source who also spoke on condition of anonymity. That ruling was based on a recommendation from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s legal adviser, said the source. <PERSON> Abdeen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> ADC </ORGANIZATION>, said that the very fact that hearings were held on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s labor practices toward Palestinians `` was an important and positive thing because it raises the consciousness of how Palestinians are treated by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' He said the finding that some rights had been violated means that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` has not been given a clean bill of health.''

At the <ORGANIZATION> Boalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, about 75 students carried signs through halls reading `` This Is Not A White-only Club'' and `` Boycott Justice,'' prompting some professors to come out of their classrooms and complain about the noise. <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinsky </PERSON> of the Coalition for a Diverse Faculty, based at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, said the group mailed organizing materials about a month ago to student organizations at several dozen schools. `` We hope that people realized that law students are concerned about these issues, that we are all not conservative and hungry for money,'' she said. She said she did n't know how many students participated in Thursday's action. <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> communications director <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> said about 100 students there attended a rally. A student claim that there were only two minority faculty members was not correct, he said, because three others are on the tenure track. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> students scheduled a rally and an afternoon boycott of classes. The 29-member faculty there has no minority members. University spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ong </PERSON> said this is the first time in 15 years that there have been no minorities on the law school faculty. One minority group member resigned unexpectedly last May; a second turned down the university's offer, he said. In <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, professors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> said attendance Thursday was down between 20 percent and 25 percent, but it was n't clear how many students had cut class as part of the protest. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Dean <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Yudof </PERSON> said the school has 54 tenured or tenure-track faculty members. There are 46 men, two blacks, one Asian-American, five women and no Hispanics. `` I think the students have called attention to a significant problem at all American law schools,'' <PERSON> Yudof </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said about 20 students had congregated in a lounge and discussed the situation as part of an `` Awareness Day.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, students handed out fliers captioned `` Tenured Hispanic Faculty'' depicting an empty picture frame. Dean <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorenberg </PERSON>, however, said the school has made `` great progress in some areas of recruitment, particularly minorities and women.'' In May, about 50 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> students, mostly black, held an overnight vigil in <PERSON> Vorenberg </PERSON>'s office and listed 12 demands. He agreed to seven, including the establishment of a fellowship to encourage blacks to teach there and a broader role for students in finding prospective minority faculty members. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> has 61 tenured faculty members; six are women and three are blacks. There are two tenure-track professors who are black.

 Foreigners continue to own just under 1 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural land, slightly more than a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said its 1988 year-end review of reports under the decade-old Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act found about 12.5 million acres in foreign hands, 99,100 acres more than reported in 1987. Of the land owned by foreign interests, 48 percent was forest land, 17 percent cropland, 30 percent pasture and other agricultural land and 5 percent non-agricultural land. Corporations held 80 percent of the foreign-owned land, with the balance held by individuals, partnerships, institutions and other entities. Much of the ownership is concentrated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Those countries combined to account for about 60 percent of all foreign-held acreage. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> continued to have the heaviest concentration of foreign ownership, with holdings of almost 1.8 million acres, mostly timberland, or more than 14 percent of the total owned by foreigners. The report said that `` 93 percent of the foreign-owned acreage will remain in agricultural production, according to foreign owners.''

<TEXT>
 A lie detector test disproves claims by <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s estate that the late actor's homosexual lover had sex with another man after filing a landmark AIDS lawsuit, an attorney argued Thursday. Attorney <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said the test indicated his client, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, was being truthful when he denied having sex with <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraulob </PERSON>, a singer and songwriter who came forward with claims of an affair after a jury awarded Christian $ 21.75 million. An attorney for <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s estate, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, said results of a lie detector test taken by <PERSON> Fraulob </PERSON> showed he too was being truthful. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fraulob </PERSON>'s test was taken before the estate filed papers saying his evidence was relevant to the case. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, who had challenged <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> to take a similar test, acknowledged that neither test was admissible in court and should not be considered by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Geernaert </PERSON> in deciding whether to grant a new trial or to reduce the jury's award to Christian, as requested by <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s estate. Both sides were in court Thursday for legal arguments on the request. A hearing is scheduled for Friday. Jurors in February found that <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> engaged in `` outrageous conduct'' by concealing from Christian that he had AIDS. The panelists, who had heard seven weeks of often lurid testimony about the dead star's sex life, said Christian should receive $ 14.5 million in actual damages and $ 7.25 million in punitive damages. After the verdict, Fraulob of <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION> filed a sworn statement claiming he had sex with Christian shortly after <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> sued in November 1985. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> contends he was so traumatized that he has remained celibate since learning <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> had AIDS. The twist that made <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>'s suit so unusual was that he did not develop AIDS and has tested negative for the disease. In previous lawsuits, only those who actually contracted a sexually transmitted disease were able to win damages. Christian, 35, sued for emotional distress, saying he had lived with the fear of coming down with the deadly disease since learning in 1985 that the movie star had AIDS. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 58, died on Oct. 5, 1985, three months after the public learned that he had the disease.

 Backers of a bill to curb the amount of commercials shown on TV shows for children said Thursday that broadcasters have stepped up the pitches on such programs since ad limits were lifted five years ago. Kids are being exposed to as much as 42 percent more toy, cereal and candy advertising per hour than adults, as advertisers target `` a particularly vulnerable audience,'' Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearing An independent station in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> is inserting as many as 14 minutes of commericals into each hour of kids' shows, compared with an average eight minutes for adult network programs, <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee that he chairs. `` We have a duty to see to it that this child audience is protected from wave after wave of exploitive commercials,'' he said. Prior to 1984, when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> lifted commercial limits on kids' TV shows, the amount of ads on network children's programs was at or below the 9 -LCB- minute-per-hour rules that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had established in 1974, <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said. Since 1984, `` commercial time has been on the rise, with stations at two of the networks now offering as many as 11 minutes per hour of commercial matter,'' he said. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said the government must stem `` endless streams'' of TV commercials on children's shows because broadcasters are not regulating themselves. But <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, said an <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION> survey found children's programs contained an average of about 8 -LCB- minutes of commerical time per hour. He said that `` there does not appear to be a deluge of commercials raining down upon the viewers of children's programming. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also said program-length commercials made by advertisers have not done well. `` The child audience has made distinctions between program content and commercial content and on its own has avoided a deluge of commercials,'' he said. But Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, D-Kan., said it was `` naive'' to think the marketplace would regulate itself He said money drives the television business and that `` about 80 percent of network programming is unmitigated crap.'' <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON> said the networks were n't meeting their responsibilities to children and the government should `` put as much pressure as possible'' on them. <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON> said the bill will not affect responsible broadcasters `` one iota.'' The bill would impose a limit of 10 -LCB- minutes of advertising per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays for kid's shows The legislation, written in cooperation with NAB and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>, also would require the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> at license-renewal time to consider how well a broadcaster has been committed to educational and informational needs of children in its overall programming. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed an identical bill last year but then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed it on constitutional grounds. <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertisers </ORGANIZATION>, told the subcommittee he also thought the measure was unconstitutional and that less advertising might mean lower-quality shows. `` Program producers must have the flexibility to determine how best to balance the entertainment needs of the audience with the financial requirements of good programming,'' <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> unintentionally advertised falsely that its Kraft Singles cheese slices contain as much calcium as five ounces of milk and more than imitation cheese, according to a ruling of a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> administrative law judge released Thursday. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> said it did not believe the ads were misleading and would appeal the ruling to the full commission. One of the challenged ads said: `` Imitation slices use hardly any milk. But <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> has five ounces per slice. So her little bones get calcium they need to grow.'' The judge, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, said the ad implied that the slice contained as much calcium as five ounces of milk and did not mention that 30 percent of the calcium in the milk is lost in processing. Also, he said, the ads can be taken as implying `` that imitation slices which, they state, use hardly any milk, contain less calcium than <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> <PERSON> Singles </PERSON>.'' In fact, almost all imitation and non-dairy cheese contains just as much calcium as the real thing, he said. However, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> `` did not intend to make'' misrepresentations and it was `` debatable'' whether the company should have known that false claims could be inferred from the ads, he said. `` The advertisements ... were developed by <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> in response to the success of non-dairy imitation and substitute cheese slices, and were not intended to convey express deceptive claims.'' He ordered the company not to misrepresent the nutritional content of its cheese slices in the future. In <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, company spokesman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> was pleased that the judge recognized `` there was no intent on the part of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> to mislead the public.'' `` Copy testing that we've done demonstrates that consumers do not receive the implied message'' as stated in <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s ruling, <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> is `` confident that the integrity of the advertising will be upheld'' by the commission, he said. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverglade </PERSON>, attorney for Science in the Public Interest, the advocacy group which asked the commission to look into the matter in 1985, said he was pleased with the decision. `` It may represent a reawakening of the federal government to problems of misleading health claims in food advertising,'' he said.

 Canadian environmentalists expressed concern Thursday over the Alaskan oil spill despite repeated predictions from top government officials that it wo n't reach the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> coast. `` Even if it does n't reach our shores, our wildlife that we share with <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> already is affected greatly,'' oceanographer <PERSON> Silvaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> of the activist group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said in a phone interview from <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Leading environmental groups also say that even if the oil from the largest spill ever in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> does n't reach <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> this time, the Exxon Valdez incident illustrates that an accident closer to home is inevitable. The spill, which has prompted parliamentary debate in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, is about 650 miles from Canadian waters and does n't threaten to change course toward the south, according to the federal fisheries, environment and transportation ministers. Fisheries Minister <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddon </PERSON> returned to the lobby of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday with a map of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and his account that the spill wo n't affect <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>, who represents in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s northwestern <LOCATION> Skeena </LOCATION> district closest to the spill, said his information was that the slick is only about 250 miles away. That information `` is clear beyond a reasonable doubt,'' <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said during the emergency debate he requested Tuesday night. He is the environment critic for the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the third largest national party in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> must be prepared to handle the spill if the winds should change. He called it a `` monster now starting to come out of -LRB- the -RRB- sound, and with pieces breaking off.'' `` If the wind changes direction and picks up, parts of the slick will reach <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. We can always hope that the wind does n't blow,'' he said. The presence of supertankers in the sea lanes off of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> has been a longtime subject of debate in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said some people consider the possibility of an eventual disaster off of the Canadian coast as a mathematical certainty, not a statistical probability. She said that the wildlife shared with <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> includes the parent stocks of sea mammals such as sea otters. She also expressed concern about the gray whales that are migrating north from their winter zones off of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also supported the New Democrats' call during the parliamentary debate for a federal inquiry into the safety of coastal tanker shipping Parliament returned to session this week after a three-month recess following the election last fall of a second consecutive majority government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>INS Plan Would Allow Swift Denials of Political Asylum Applications</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is studying a proposal that would allow authorities to summarily exclude aliens seeking political asylum without giving them a hearing before an immigration judge, officials said Thursday. Under a plan drafted by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, specially trained <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> hearing officers would conduct informal proceedings to consider an alien's claim for asylum status. One critic of the proposal said it would `` obliterate fairness and due process'' for asylum seekers that is now provided by immigration law. The proposal, which is still under study, would `` provide for summary exclusion of aliens who seek asylum at ports of entry who fail to make a credible showing'' of eligibility, according to an internal <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysis of the plan. `` This should discourage those who are claiming asylum, but in fact have no legitimate right to this status, from attempting to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under this claim,'' according to the document. People seeking asylum must demonstrate a `` well-founded fear of persecution'' for a variety of factors, including ethnic background and political or religious beliefs. The proposal to amend current immigration law would require approval by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It was drafted by <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of the flood of Central Americans crossing the border from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> over the last 10 months. Most were denied political asylum on the ground that they were fleeing poverty, not political persecution. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON>, director of legislative affairs for <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposal was in an `` early stage of review.'' He described the plan as a `` legislative proposal that has been generated at a staff level'' and circulated to various divisions of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, including the office of Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. It was drafted as a possible solution to the `` misuse or abuse of the asylum process'' by Central Americans who come to the border without a legal claim for political asylum status, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> said. `` The present system allows an alien to make successive applications to the district -LRB- INS -RRB- director and to an immigration judge, leading to a time-consuming process,'' the department's analysis said An adverse ruling by the immigration judge can be appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> and thence to federal circuit courts of appeal _ a process that could extend an alien's stay for many months. The draft proposal would eliminate the hearing mechanism for aliens at ports of entry who are denied political asylum. `` There are people who would use the asylum process as a means of staying here even though they are not qualified,'' <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>, director of the political asylum project of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said the plan would `` obliterate fairness and due process for most asylum seekers.'' `` This would be a very serious attack on asylum'' as a means of entering the country, he said. `` It would affect thousands of people arriving at the border,'' <PERSON> Helton </PERSON> said. In the 1988 fiscal year, 60,000 people sought asylum and if current rates continue the total for the current year will be more than 100,000, <PERSON> Helton </PERSON> said. The draft legislation also contains a provision that would increase by 5,000 the number of refugee visas that would be granted in the 1989 fiscal year for aliens from Central American nations. Anyone seeking refugee status must apply in their own country. By increasing the number of visas by 5,000 authorities hope to encourage Central Americans to apply at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in their home countries, according to the draft. INS is currently authorized to admit 3,500 eligible refugees from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the current fiscal year. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> proposal would abolish the right of aliens pressing claims at immigration-court hearings to be represented by an attorney. When an alien is examined by an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officer, an attorney could act as an adviser but could not be an advocate, presenting evidence. `` The officer's determination would be administratively final'' but could be overruled by the attorney general or the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> commissioner, the proposal said. The influx of refugees from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border over the last 10 months prompted <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to set up a detention facility for people awaiting immigration court hearings. On Wednesday, 2,150 refugees were being detained at the INS facility in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isabel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A total of 4,340 refugees were being detained at various INS locations in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the agency said. Aliens denied political aslyum are given the choice of returning to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of facing detention while they await the outcome of immigration court proceedings. The crisis stemmed from an upsurge in asylum applications at the border crossing from the normal monthly total of about 400 to 5,000 a month between June 1988 and Feb. 1. The flow was reduced after <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> imposed emergency procedures, enabling one-day processing of asylum applications at Port Isabel. The proposal would also eliminate the right to apply for political asylum at any point during a deportation proceeding. Aliens would be required to file a notice of intent to file such an application two weeks after the start of deportation proceedings. The applicant would then have another 30 days to file the papers. If the deadlines were missed, a political asylum claim would be allowed only if the alien showed `` changed circumstances'' in his home country would make him qualified.

<HEAD>Administration Moves to Widen Immigration Gate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration moved Thursday to widen <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s gate for the unexpected flood of Jews, Armenians and Pentecostals allowed to emigrate from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but it still faced stiff criticism for the bureaucratic barriers which have thwarted that exodus so far. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials formally notified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intends to raise, from 25,000 to 43,500, the refugee admissions ceiling this year for applicants from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Moreover, they advanced legislation to create a new `` special immigrant'' category to accommodate up to 30,000 additional applicants. But those initiatives did n't spare the administration from being lambasted on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where several lawmakers charged that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> footdragging on the refugee issue remains a major embarrassment to a nation which, after all, has fought for years to convince <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to loosen its emigration policy. Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on immigration, said the slow pace in which applications have been handled, and in many cases denied, runs the risk of destroying `` a tremendous victory for bipartisan foreign policy In short, let's not blow it.'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> and several other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already had fashioned alternative legislative measures designed to speed entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the nearly 8,000 Soviet citizens, half of them Jews, seeking refugee visas each month. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s counter-proposals were served up just as the panel began hearings on those measures Meanwhile, another panel, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, approved the administration's request for $ 100 million in supplemental money this year to help pay for the increase in refugee processing. At <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s hearing, Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., noted that at one point after Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> eased emigration restrictions in late 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> only had one person assigned to handle the refugee applications `` And the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told us that was the consequence of appropriations constraints,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> snapped. `` It was one of the three silliest things the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has ever said, strong competition notwithstanding.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federations </ORGANIZATION>, more than 7,000 Jews are stalled in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, awaiting processing by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Thousands of others, still in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, have been told it could take as long as two years to get an initial screening interview at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the council says. Despite <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s persistent questioning, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coordinator for refugee affairs, declined to say whether the consular and immigration staffs in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would be substantially beefed up, noting there are mutual limits on the size of each country's missions. But he suggested part of the problem in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> may be eased by forwarding some of the paperwork to other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offices for completion. The last major Soviet emigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> occurred nearly 10 years ago, when 28,400 people came as refugees. For the next seven years, relatively few Soviets were permitted to emigrate, but it remained a matter of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy to grant automatic refugee status to any Soviet citizen who got out and asked entry into <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Following <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy change, more than 20,400 Soviet refugees were admitted to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last fiscal year, an almost sixfold increase over the 1987 figure and a tide that caught <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials off guard. To the dismay of many refugee groups and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> then switched gears and began denying, on a case-by-case basis, refugee visas to a substantial number of applicants. Such denials are based on findings that the applicant has not demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that a total of 4,919 Soviets had been denied refugee status from October 1988 through March 31. In that period, 11,783 people were approved in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, while 2,073 were denied at those embassies. Meanwhile, 13,568 were approved at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy, and 4,919 were denied there. Virtually all of the Jews and Pentecostals leaving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are doing so with Israeli visas. But instead of going on to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the vast majority _ about 95 percent _ stop in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to apply for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visas. Armenian emigres, on the other hand, constitute most of the refugee applicants applying directly at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s latest proposal would create a new, discretionary category of `` special immigrants'' as selected from time to time by the president. They could become citizens, and would have other rights and benefits shared by refugees. Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, D-Minn., said the `` special immigrant'' idea `` certainly does not address the long-term difficulties of increased immigration of refugees from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> insisted `` our Soviet program is still one of the most generous of all immigration programs.'' And `` We wish to make it clear that absolutely no Soviet seeking relief is forced to return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Sanctions Against Panama Extended 1 Year by Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> extended economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for one year on Thursday, calling the government of military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` corrupt, repressive and inept.'' In an executive order, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that the `` actions and policies of the -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- regime in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Sanctions put in place by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration were to expire on Saturday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> notified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he was retaining them for an additional year. However, the sanctions could be modified depending on the outcome of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s May 7 presidential election. `` After the election, we'll take a look at the situation there and see if there's any cause for change,'' said an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` If the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people have a chance to express their will in a free and open manner, we're confident <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will go,'' said the official. However, he conceced that prospects for a fair election were uncertain in that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> appears likely to control the process. The sanctions include sharp restrictions on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that do business in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, a hold on assets of the Panamanian government in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and a prohibitation on tax payments by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organizations to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime. `` The objective of administration policy remains support for a return to civilian constitutional rule and the development of an apolitical military establishment in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our judgment remains that the root cause of the current crisis is the fact that the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people have lost confidence in a political system widely perceived as corrupt, repressive and inept.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would keep the sanctions in place `` as long as these measures are appropriate.'' They will automatically expire April 8, 1990, unless he renews them again. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is accused in a federal drug-running case in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, has been the de facto ruler of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since February 1988, when he orchestrated the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as military leader after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug-trafficking charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denied the charges. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> continues to recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as president and imposed the sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration cut off military and economic aid to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in July 1987. The administration has amended the sanctions to permit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses with subsidiaries in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to pay amounts owed to the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ including taxes withheld from paychecks of workers in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ into escrow accounts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said that 170 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies with subsidiaries in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are being notified by letter of these changes. `` Information received from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> indicates that certain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms with operations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> may have faiiled to withhold Panamanian taxes from employee paychecks in possible violation of the regulations,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement said.

 Savings and loan customers withdrew $ 9.4 billion from their accounts in February, down only slightly from a record $ 10.6 billion in January, the government said Thursday. The $ 20 billion withdrawn during the first two months of this year is more than double the $ 8.6 billion for all of last year and puts new pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to move swiftly as it begins writing legislation to close or merge failed S & amp; Ls. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the outflow to the failure of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to keep pace with rising interest rates offered by competitors, chiefly money market mutual funds. But, in recent weeks, top administration officials, including <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, has been citing the outflow as evidence of public nervousness that will persist until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adopts President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to spend $ 50 billion over the next three years to bail out the industry. February marks the 10th straight month of net withdrawals and the fourth month of withdrawals in excess of $ 7 billion. Earlier, from October 1987 though May of last year, billions of dollars flowed into <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls as stock market investors sought the safety of federally insured accounts. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a financial institutions analyst in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said S & amp; Ls, as a substitute for deposits, were turning increasingly toward advances from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>, a trend he called disturbing. Although the 12 regional banks are controlled by the industry, they borrow in financial markets and relend to S & amp; Ls at low government-subsidized rates. Advances from the system have increased by $ 15.8 billion from October to February. `` It disturbs me that the banks are being looked to so heavily by the thrifts. It represents more and more of a growing government involvement in the entire industry,'' <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>FEC Warns that Presidential Election Fund Running Dry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> warned <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday that the fund used to finance presidential elections is running dry because Americans are less inclined to earmark $ 1 of their tax payment for it. `` Unless the system is modified, by 1996 the fund will lack sufficient monies to finance the presidential elections,'' <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations committees. Meanwhile, two <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers introduced legislation that would require candidates who are eligible to receive public funds in the general election campaign to agree in writing to participate in at least four 90-minute debates. The vice presidential nominees would be required to engage in at least one debate. `` If presidential candidates are going to continue to take $ 100 million from taxpayers to run their campaigns, then there ought to be some assurance that they will stand up on stage, face their opponent and engage in a true discussion of the issues,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., who introduced the legislation with Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION> Under the proposal, the debates would be sponsored by non-partisan organizations and held in September and October. At least 30 minutes of each 90-minute debate would be devoted to questions and answers or candidate-to-candidate exchanges. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> would determine whether candidates are responsible for failing to comply. Taxpayer contributions, which come from checking a $ 1 contribution box on tax returns, have been declining because, according to <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, `` each year fewer and fewer think they're getting their dollar's worth. The percentage of taxpayers contributing to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund has dropped steadily from 28.7 percent in 1981 to 21 percent in 1988, according to the ongressional <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Once overflowing, the campaign fund is falling victim to inflation as well as a dropoff in income. <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiland </PERSON> said the peak year was $ 41 million earmarked on returns filed in 1981. On returns filed last year, only $ 33 million was earmarked for the election fund. The fund is the source for the matching contributions the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> allocates to candidates for the major party nominations as well as the lump sum payments made to the nominees for the general elections campaign. In 1988, Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received federal checks for $ 46.1 million each for their fall campaigns. In addition, each party received $ 9.2 million. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> also paid out a total of $ 66.7 million in matching funds. The commission matches up to $ 250 in individual contributions to qualified presidential candidates during the primary campaign. Republican <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> received $ 10.1 million in matching funds, the largest amount of any presidential candidate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was second with $ 9 million and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> third with $ 8.4 million. The fund paid out a total of $ 177 million in 1988. The first year it operated was 1976 when $ 70 million was distributed to candidates. <PERSON> Eiland </PERSON> said the fund is expected to have enough money to cover the 1992 election assuming President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has no serious opposition for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination.

<HEAD>Police Report Cites Danger of Guerrilla War In Kosovo Province</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal police report quoted in the official press on Thursday expressed concern that some ethnic Albanians could stage guerrilla warfare against federal authorities in troubled <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province. Bloody clashes between ethnic Albanians and security forces left at least 24 people dead in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> last week, including two policemen, and 200 injured. Ethnic Albanians, who comprise about 85 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s population, took to the streets to protest constitutional changes which they say limit the province's autonomy The changes took effect March 28 and gave <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> more control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s judiciary, schools and police. Some ethnic Albanians `` announced they would flee into the woods'' which indicates <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is faced with `` a danger of separatist guerrilla warfare,'' the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> daily quoted the police report as saying. According to the report, about 45,000 ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON> took part in last week's riots in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. A state of emergency and curfews were introduced there in a crackdown against the protests. Borba quoted a police officer as saying 16 major fires hit forests and factories in the province since April 1, and described the fires as `` terrorist diversions'' by ethnic Albanian nationalists. The <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said a major highway leading from the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Urosevac </LOCATION> was closed for more than two hours Wednesday because `` unknown people tried to plant explosives on the road.'' A <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> police statement meanwhile confirmed unofficial reports that two ethnic Albanian boys were killed on Wednesday. It said they were shot by another ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> youth playing with a rifle said to belong to a soldier guarding a military observation post. The statement gave no other details. The incident reportedly occurred in <LOCATION> Malisevo </LOCATION> village, about 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>. On the political front, media reports said Thursday that <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> rejected a public call for introducing democratic elections with competing candidates and proposed its <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, for the office of the republic's president. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a Communist-run umbrella organization, on Wednesday turned down a proposal that <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, the sole official candidate for president, be elected by public ballot. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most liberal republic, held its first Western-style general elections last Sunday, featuring two candidates and a secret ballot for its representative on the country's collective presidency. <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Drnovsek </PERSON>, a 38-year-old economist advocating closer ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, a market economy and cuts in the military budget, was elected by 56 percent of the votes cast. He is to be inaugurated as <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s next president on May 15, under the country's rotating system in which presidency members take turns every year at the head of the state presidency. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> has led the drive for more democracy in this Communist-ruled state, and has allowed several non-communist, human rights and political groups to function freely. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, led by hardliner <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, insists on the one-party system as the main solution to the country's problems. `` We will choose -LRB- <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> -RRB- according to valid constitutional norms,'' said <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Trifunovic </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Serbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. Under the Yugoslav system, the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> in each of the country's six republics and two provinces is in charge of nominating candidates for government posts.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was told Thursday that home AIDS-test kits are safe and could save thousands of lives, but the agency questioned whether the test manufacturers could provide adequate counseling and privacy. At a daylong hearing at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, the developer of an AIDS home-testing kit that failed to win <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval criticized the agency's decision, saying it was the result of politics, not scientific judgment. `` Untold thousands have become infected -LRB- with the AIDS virus -RRB- simply because there's no AIDS home test available,'' said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Millenson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, consultant who formed a company to develop and sell a blood-collection kit. `` So long as politics _ not science _ guides government action on AIDS, people will die needlessly,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has been reluctant to approve AIDS home-testing kits because of concern over whether people can safely draw their own blood and ship samples safely to a lab for testing and whether the samples can remain viable during shipping. They also are concerned about whether testers can assure confidentiality and whether test suppliers can provide adequate counseling, especially for those who test positive for the deadly virus. The agency last year rejected <PERSON> Millenson </PERSON>'s proposed home-testing kit and said it would consider for approval only tests designed for use by medical professionals in traditional health care settings. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biologics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, who conducted the hearing, said the agency will continue to consider evidence on the home-testing issue, but added, `` I do n't see there's been a lot of change'' since the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision a year ago <PERSON> Millenson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> `` has refused to study the evidence'' that backs up his claim that the test his company developed is safe, effective and would incorporate adequate education and counseling of those using it. <PERSON> Millenson </PERSON>'s home-testing kit included a device for drawing blood, a crush-proof shipping container for blood samples and a detailed instruction booklet. Users would draw their own blood, send the sample in a pre-paid shipping envelope to a laboratory and be informed of the results by telephone by trained health-care professionals, he said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Markman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> psychologist who was a consultant for <PERSON> Millenson </PERSON>'s project, dismissed the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s fears that telephone counseling for those who test positive for the lethal virus will not be adequate. He said studies have shown that telephone counseling has effects comparable to face-to-face counseling. <PERSON> Markman </PERSON> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s resistance to home testing for AIDS and said the agency appears to be saying that `` if this is out of the hands of the medical community, that's not good.'' `` It makes me wonder whether there's a turf issue that's a hidden agenda,'' he said.

 Tamil militants on Thursday blew up a truck carrying Indian troops in northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, killing at least 18 of them, military officials said. Six more soldiers were killed later in a gunbattle with the fleeing guerrillas, residents said. Militants using remote controlled devices detonated explosives buried in the road as the truck passed over it at <LOCATION> Mankulam </LOCATION> village, 26 miles north of <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION> town, military officials said. At least five soldiers were injured, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity. An official of the Indian High Commission, or embassy, in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said he was unaware of the killings. Indian troops, searching for the guerrillas, were ambushed by the militants and six soldiers were killed in the ensuing gunbattle at the nearby <LOCATION> Maharambakulam </LOCATION> village, said residents in <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION> town, 135 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The residents, who were contacted by telephone, spoke on condition of anonymity. The militants, believed to be members of the dominant <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> group, took away 15 rifles and a light machine gun after blowing up the truck, officials said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> deployed nearly 50,000 troops after Tamil militants spurned an India-sponsored peace accord signed in July 1987 and aimed at ending a Tamil insurgency in the northern and eastern provinces. At least 800 Indian soldiers have been killed in the operations against the rebels, who refused to surrender their arms, saying the accord did not meet enough of their demands for self rule. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sponsored the accord because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause. The 6-year-old Tamil secessionist war and a violent Sinhalese backlash have claimed more than 12,500 lives. The latest violence came barely 24 hours after the government announced a unilateral one-week cease-fire, beginning Tuesday. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said Wednesday: `` It -LRB- the cease-fire -RRB- will be a unilateral declaration by the government and will cover military operations by both <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and Indian armies against Sinhalese and Tamil terrorists.'' The government on Thursday also released 13 political prisoners as part of a peace proposal offered to Tamils and Sinhalese militants. After receiving a pardon from President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, the prisoners walked out of a maximum-security prison, about three miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The prisoners were Tamils convicted under anti-terrorist laws and serving sentences ranging from five to 15 years, said <PERSON> Velupillai </PERSON> <PERSON> Balakumar </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a Tamil group. Last week, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> offered Tamil and Sinhalese militants unconditional amnesty, seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and money for surrendered weapons if they stopped fighting. Neither Sinhalese militants nor the Tamil rebels have responded positively to the peace overtures. On Wednesday, Sinhalese militants called a nationwide strike to commemorate a failed uprising against the government 18 years ago. The strike was viewed as a rejection of the peace offer. Meanwhile, two opposition leaders said the cease-fire announcement would not be fruitful unless the government held negotiations with extremist leaders. Sinhalese militants started the current campaign to bring down the government after the July 1987 peace accord was signed, saying it gave too many concessions to the minority community. The predominantly Hindu Tamils comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Sinhalese Buddhists make up 75 percent and control the government and the military. Tamil militants allege their community is discriminated against by the Sinhalese in jobs and education.

 Sikh extremists burst into a farmhouse in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state and riddled the Sikh farmer and four members of his family with automatic weapons fire as they slept, police reported Thursday. News reports said five other people were killed in separate incidents by Sikhs waging a terror campaign for an independent nation in the northern agricultural region, the only Indian state where the sect is in the majority. Ten gunmen entered the farmhouse in <LOCATION> Kalchian </LOCATION> village, 25 miles from <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, Wednesday night and opened fire with assault rifles, said G.S. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a senior police officer in the district. He identified those killed as 30-year-old <PERSON> Buta </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>; his father <PERSON> Joginder </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 60; mother <PERSON> Charan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaur </PERSON>, 55; brother <PERSON> Jarnail </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 32, and nephew <PERSON> Natha </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 26. He said <PERSON> Joginder </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s mother-in-law, <PERSON> Dalwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaur </PERSON>, was seriously wounded `` The walls of the room were blood-splattered and the bodies lay in pools of blood,'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. Most victims of the terrorists are Hindus, but they sometimes kill Sikhs who do not support their cause. <PERSON> Buta </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was among Sikhs detained in the June 1984 army raid on <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, the holiest shrine of <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said he was released with 137 others in September 1988. The agency said Sikh extremists shot a village headman dead in the <LOCATION> Jalandhar </LOCATION> district, 45 miles south of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, late Wednesday and later hanged a Hindu priest in a nearby village. Another person was hanged Wednesday near <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, bringing to 14 the number killed in that manner since two Sikhs were executed by hanging Jan. 6 for the assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in October 1984. She had ordered the raid on the Golden Temple with the purpose of flushing out extremists who had turned the shrine into a fortress. At least 1,200 people were killed in the raid. Militants began fighting for an independent Sikh homeland in 1982 and the violence has increased every year since. At least 510 people have been killed so far this year in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> state. Sikhs, whose faith is rooted in <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, are only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people, although they have a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. They claim discrimination by Hindus, who make up 90 percent of the population.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> confirmed Thursday that it delivered fighter-bombers to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> last month, but said they were defensive aircraft and did not have the range to threaten <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the total was `` around half a dozen,'' not 12 to 15 as claimed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The issue appeared to cast a shadow over the otherwise warm, constructive tone of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s talks with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. With <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reports of the bomber sale capturing headlines in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for an explanation and got none, her spokesman said. Her foreign secretary, Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, also raised the matter with his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> responded by mentioning British arms sales to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said his government was concerned because <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is a terrorist state, said the British spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told a news conference he did not know about the sale, but later went on television to confirm elements of the report while seeking to minimize its significance. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources have said the aircraft are SU-24 Fencers, which can fly within an 800-mile radius without refueling, far enough to reach <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and even <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from existing Libyan airfields. They say the jets were shipped in crated pieces to the Libyans aboard Soviet transport planes. In interviews on Channel 4 News and BBC-TV, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the planes, whose type he did not specify, were supplied to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> under a 1986 agreement. He said it was `` an old contract,'' not more than six were sold and they were shipped in pieces. `` This is not a long-range bomber,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` This is a bomber that you can use for closer activities. Its operational range is 300 miles. `` It's a front-line bomber,'' he added. `` It's for defense only. You can not really use it for offensive purposes.'' The interviewer said the planes could refuel in midair and reach <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to which <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> replied: `` Theoretically maybe, but <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has no refueling capacity at all.'' The sale comes at a time when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is trying to improve relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as part of its effort to play a greater role in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> condemned the sale. `` We are surprised that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which states that it seeks to relieve situations of confrontations around the world ... is supplying offensive weaponry'' to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, on condition of anonymity. `` This will not add to stability in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. On <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> television, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the planes were delivered in March and suggested they would not be operational for some time because they were delivered `` in crates. ... You must put them together. It takes time and know-how to do it.'' He said the sale to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> `` is really small fry'' campared with the British contract to sell <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> billions of dollars worth of Tornado fighter-bombers.

<HEAD>Vets Who Built Clinic For Former Enemy Return To Happy Greetings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A group of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans flew home from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to a greeting of confetti, hugs and kisses Thursday after building a 14-room clinic for their former enemies with $ 50,000 in donated money. `` Boy, we did n't get a greeting like this when we came back from the war,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> veteran <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, among the six volunteers who returned to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after nearly four months in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The veterans, along with about 30 Vietnamese they paid $ 1 a day each, erected a one-story, 2,500-square-foot building at <LOCATION> Vung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tau </LOCATION>, some 60 miles from <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, formerly <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. The veterans said they watched with pride Saturday while local politicians made speeches under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese flags in a champagne-toasted ceremony to mark the finish of the project. The unusual mission left <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> feeling much better about himself than he did after serving a year in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, was the job foreman on what he and his buddies called the `` Veterans Vietnam Restoration Project,'' an idea that originated with a Veterans of Foreign Wars contingent at <LOCATION> Garberville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It was,'' he said, `` out of a sense of purpose, to do something kind for the Vietnamese people,'' he said, but not because he felt he had hurt them in the war. `` I do n't lay that personal guilt on myself,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> declared. `` But I have problems secondary to that. There was something about the Vietnamese people I had to do.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he did n't have to come home from the war to conclude, as he did, that there was something wrong with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` In my first three months in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> I noticed it was a crazy war and it was wrong and that some day we would have to make up for it,'' he said. The volunteers, who had collected $ 50,000 in a funding drive that began last year, were given housing by the Vietnamese government, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. But they had to buy their own food and other necessities. They ran into some surprises in building their clinic. Instead of using concrete blocks they had to use small locally made bricks. The basic design, which called for a 1,500-square-foot building, was changed to 2,500 square feet at the insistence of local politicians. And every day, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, he had to deal with local officials who had to approve of everything that was to be done. `` We brought some tools and experience, but we did n't realize we could n't get power to the job site,'' he said. `` We did n't realize water was rationed so we could n't mix materials. We did n't realize everything had to be done by hand.''

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> argued passionately Thursday in talks that covered weapons sales to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and disarmament, officials said. The leaders described their private morning talks as friendly, but a British spokesman said they argued energetically over the Soviets' reported sale of long-range bombers to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> or a possible negotiated ban on chemical weapons. A Soviet spokesman said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> complained to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, a staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s review of foreign policy is threatening to stall the momentum of nuclear arms reduction talks. In a toast at a dinner honoring <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> made clear she is unshaken in her belief that at least some nuclear weapons are necessary to deter war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> replied he could not accept that view. He said the prime minister considers him a romantic for advocating a nuclear-free world, but he contended his position `` reflects the harsh realities of our time.'' After a wreath-laying ceremony at <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet president stopped his motorcade to shake hands with about 20 people in a crowd of several hundred, showing off the spontaneity that has won him popularity in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Later he met British businessmen and appealed to them to step up trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, saying: `` I invite businessmen to act and operate on the principle that the brave capture cities.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, emerging from her 10 Downing St. residence after four hours of talks, said the meeting was very friendly and covered `` all of the principal topics of the day.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said his fifth meeting with the conservative leader reached `` a degree of mutual understanding'' that enabled them to discuss the problems of nuclear arsenals, regional conflict and specialized Soviet-British matters. A Thatcher spokesman said on condition of anonymity after the talks that the two `` love arguing. They have this way of arguing very strongly but never losing their tempers.'' He also called the discussions `` extremely frank ... animated, warm, passionate and solemn.'' But there were no indications that the staunchly anti-communist prime minister and the reform-minded <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief resolved differences. The British spokesman said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> raised the reported sale of Soviet long-range bombers to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, saying: `` We are sorry you are doing this.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not respond, the official said. Interviewed on Channel 4 News, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> confirmed bombers were supplied to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> under a 1986 agreement, but insisted they were short-range defensive aircraft. He said no more than six were delivered and that their range was 300 miles, not 800 miles as reported in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. They could not reach <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> without refueling, and `` <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has no refueling capacity at all,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` You can not really use it for offensive purposes,'' he said. British Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also reportedly clashed over the issue. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> did not reply directly, but he noted <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is a major arms supplier to other <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> countries. `` Our reply to that is, ` Yes, but <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is a terrorist state,'' the British spokesman said. At a news conference, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> charged that the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> arms deal was leaked in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` just to ruin the atmosphere'' of the Soviet-British summit. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> also said that `` prolonged reviews of foreign policy'' could lead to a loss of momentum in disarmament talks. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered a review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy when he took office in January. The review is still under way, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will not be `` stampeded'' by Soviet initiatives such as disarmament proposals. In her toast at dinner, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> restated her opposition to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s call for total nuclear disarmament by the year 2000. `` Both our countries know from bitter experience that conventional weapons do not deter war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, whereas nuclear weapons have done so for over 40 years,'' she said. `` As a deterrent, there is no substitute for them.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> responded he would stick to his proposal, acknowledging several stages would be necessary before all nuclear weapons are eliminated. He said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> thinks there is `` a good measure of romanticism in this approach ... I can not accept that.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> signed agreements designed to protect private business development and make it easier for individuals to obtain visas. The British side also pledged to build a school in earthquake-stricken <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, for which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressed gratitude. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> originally planned to visit <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in December, but he canceled the trip after the earthquake wrecked cities and killed thousands of people. <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> toured St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s Cathedral and visited Tower Bridge for a view of the city through a chilly drizzle. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is to address businessmen in a speech Friday. He then goes to <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> to see Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> before returning to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at the end of the six-day tour, which also took him to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

North noted that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had the capabilities that he had proffered, and that the cost of any operations could be borne by Project Democracy. 99. Admiral <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> responded that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had assets inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, he could be helpful. The USG could not be involved in assassination, but <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> assistance with sabotage would be another story. Admiral <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> North </PERSON> speak with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> directly. ... 106. In late September 1986, Lt.

 Security forces engaged black nationalist guerrillas in bitter combat Thursday as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> arranged emergency talks to salvage the U.N.-sponsored plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence. `` There is a crisis in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` We've got a real problem. Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand, a South African who heads <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> territorial force, said 42 guerrillas were killed in clashes Thursday afternoon, including one battle involving scores of insurgents. An undetermined number of policemen were injured, he said. Government-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said a `` pitched battle ... raged for several hours'' Thursday between security forces and about 200 guerrillas. Du Rand said at least 252 guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and 24 members of the South African-led security forces have been killed since gunbattles broke out Saturday, when a cease-fire was supposed to take effect. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s state news agency quoted <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> defense spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Muehihange </PERSON> as saying only 38 guerrillas died in that time and nine are missing. He said 20 security force members were killed. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said his government is committed to the plan to grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> has ruled for 74 years. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> claims <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has sent more than 1,500 guerrillas into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in violation of an accord requiring the insurgents to remain at their bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, at least 100 miles away. The South African Council of Churches, led by prominent anti-apartheid clergymen, said `` the carnage of the last few days'' could have been prevented if the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had denied <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s request to let its forces leave their bases to combat the guerrillas. It said the credibility of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force was in doubt. A joint South African-Cuban-Angolan commission monitoring the independence accord scheduled a meeting Saturday to discuss the crisis. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet observers would participate. `` I trust that the commission will be able to find a peaceful solution to the very serious situation which has arisen,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for African Affairs, left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday to attend the commission meeting. A Namibian police official, Chief Inspector <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Brune </PERSON>, reported more skirmishes Thursday across the 300-mile front near the Angolan border. He said the guerrillas have broken up into small groups and that some fighters were reported as far as 120 miles south of the border. <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornberry </PERSON>, second-in-command of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> contingent, said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> hoped to have its first infantry battalions in the battle areas early next week. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has authorized 4,650 troops for the <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> operation, but only 921 have arrived. The only forces in the battle area are about 300 logistical personnel. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> accepted a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer to fly 850 Finnish soldiers to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, spokesman for Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, told reporters the men could be arriving over the weekend. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> officials said the guerrilla fighters had been inside <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> for some time and had no intention of leaving or accepting a surrender proposal. But <PERSON> Thornberry </PERSON> said: `` It was made clear beyond a shadow of a doubt to <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> that it would have to negotiate an additional element'' to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan if it wanted bases inside <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December when <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> signed an accord calling for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops who have helped Marxist <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> battle U.S.-backed rebels. Besides granting <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independence, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is to end military aid to the Angolan rebels. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which has been waging a war for independence for 23 years, is favored to win elections scheduled in November under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan.

<HEAD>Air Force Says Problem Does Not Stall Return of Bombers to the Air</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the in-flight loss of escape hatches on two B-1B bombers would lead to more frequent inspections of the equipment in the future but the problem had not stalled the return of the bombers to the air. Col. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said 60 of the 97 B-1Bs in the fleet had been cleared for air operations by late Thursday and that all of the B-1Bs scheduled for training flights Thursday or Thursday night would be permitted to fly. The B-1B fleet has been slowly returning to the air this week after being grounded in the wake of a March 27 incident at <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. That incident involved the failure of gears that move the wings on the swing-wing bomber. As that grounding order was being lifted this week, two B-1Bs experienced unusual problems with the same escape hatch suddenly blowing off during training flights. The first hatch-blowing incident occurred about 11 a.m. Tuesday as the jet was climbing from a low-altitude exercise near the <LOCATION> Texas-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> border. The 3-foot by 4-foot hatch blew off at about 12,500 feet. Then at about 11:45 a.m. Wednesday, a hatch in the same place on another B-1B blew off at about 19,000 feet as the jet flew over La Junta Training Range near <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. No one was injured and both airplanes made routine landings But the incidents caused the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to order another inspection of each plane before they took off on training flights. <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had not recovered either of the two hatches, but that inspections of the other planes in the fleet suggested routine opening and closing of the hatches during maintenance can gradually throw the locking latches `` beyond normal tolerance levels.'' `` We're going to perform the inspection on these hatches more often,'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said. `` It's part of the growing process with a new plane. As equipment matures, you have to adjust your maintenance and inspection schedules.'' The spokesman added technicians also had discovered that by painting a small stripe across the hatch inside the plane, it was possible to provide an easy visual cue to the crew to make sure a hatch is shut tight. As for the problem that prompted the grounding, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said that 87 B-1Bs had undergone the required inspection by Thursday and 60 had been cleared for flight. Ten are awaiting inspection. In the case of the other 27, he continued, a gear box that handles drive shafts that help to move the wings has been removed and shipped to the <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the maker, for inspection. The spokesman declined to predict when the entire fleet would be back in the air.

 The prosecutor who fought to keep <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in jail despite an overturned murder conviction has been fired by the district attorney, who said his assistant mishandled the case. Two other assistant prosecutors who worked on the case have resigned, reportedly because they were embarrassed by the state's bungled attempts to deny the imprisoned man his freedom <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 48, who insulted a colleague and two judges during a last-minute battle to keep <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> behind bars, was fired by District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> `` just did not handle -LRB- the <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> case -RRB- the way I had told him to handle it. ... He was convinced he was doing right and I was convinced he was doing wrong.'' Several phone calls by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> were not returned Thursday. `` First <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> and now <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. Is no icon safe in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>?'' asked <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> attorney who represented <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> during appeals of his 1977 capital murder conviction of a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer. `` Apparently, the powers that be just perceived that they could not longer keep him in the office. But I think he was just following orders,'' <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> said. `` I guarantee you if he won the recusal hearing -LRB- to oust state district Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> from the case -RRB-, he would n't have been fired.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, whose conviction for the 1976 slaying of a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer was overturned last month, was freed March 21 after spending 12 -LCB- years in prison. At one point he came within three days of execution. His case was resurrected with evidence uncovered in a documentary by <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> `` The Thin Blue Line,'' which strongly suggested that <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was not slain by <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, but by witness <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Acting on <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON>'s recommendation, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the original prosecutor suppressed evidence while at least two witnesses lied on the stand. Assistant district attorneys <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Creuzot </PERSON>, who represented the state in a December hearing on whether <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> should receive a new trial, announced earlier this week that they would leave the office by the end of the month. Both said they will pursue private practices. `` It's time for me to move on,'' said Ms. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, 32, who has been with the office 5 -LCB- years. `` It's time for me to leave.'' `` It's time to move to greener pastures,'' said <PERSON> Creuzot </PERSON>, 31. He's been with the office six years. But sources who asked not to be identified said both Ms. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Creuzot </PERSON> were embarrassed by the state's efforts to keep <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in jail. After <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> a personal recognizance bond, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> tried to have <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> removed from the case and succeeded in getting <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' bond increased. At a hearing on the motion to oust <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> the next day, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> insulted <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and the judge who wrote the March 1 opinion overturning <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' conviction.

 <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, on a whirlwind tour of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Thursday, watched a Punch and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> show and appealed to children to `` let the flowers grow everywhere'' as a symbol of peace. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> arrived late Wednesday night from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> with her husband for a two-day visit, their second to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and did not seem to mind trading <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s hot sunshine for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s chilly rain. `` I feel quite fresh after <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>,'' she told reporters at Tower Bridge during a five-minute stop at the misty <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION>. Visiting Prior <PERSON> Weston </PERSON> primary school, she received a bouquet of red carnations and urged the children to `` tell your grown-up brothers and sisters, your parents and your friends, that we spoke about flowers growing throughout the world.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sealed this wish with a kiss, leaving 9-year-old <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> pink with embarrassment and adorned with two bright-red lipstick kisses on his cheeks. `` I did n't dislike it. But I did n't like it either,'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> said of his close encounter with the Soviet first lady. `` You have got a bit of history on your cheek,'' head teacher <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Caven </PERSON> told him. `` Eventually Mum will make me wash it off,'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> replied. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also toured the Museum of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where she watched a few scenes from a Punch and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> show and saw an exhibit commemorating <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, communism's founding father, who lived in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and studied the poverty that afflicted the capital in the 19th century. `` I'm glad to come and see this great and beautiful city again where history is in close touch with the present time. I've tried to see as much as I can,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> started her sightseeing tour at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, Sir <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Wren </PERSON>'s architectural masterpiece A small crowd of about 100 stood across the street in drizzling rain as Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> arrived. At the entrance, 4-year-old <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> presented her with pink and white flowers. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> picked her up, gave her a kiss and presented her with a box of Russian chocolates. Her mother, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, holding the opened box on the church steps, said that while Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was touring the cathedral, <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> had already started eating the chocolates. `` They're lovely. She's had two,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, whose husband is the cathedral's assistant music director. After she left, the dean of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, the Very Rev. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had been `` quite fascinated and very impressed'' by her visit. He said Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, an atheist, must have been touched by the power of God. `` I do n't think she found Christianity but I hope she found a few Christians,'' he said. `` I do n't think you could come to this building without something of the glory rubbing off.''

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> human rights officials said Thursday the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has agreed to sign an accord allowing its citizens to take human rights complaints directly to international investigators. They said the Soviets would sign the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Soviet acceptance of the document would be an extension of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s declaration in December that human rights should be given new emphasis in international affairs. <PERSON> Rajsoomer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lallah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> associated with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pocar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> of the committee told reporters the notice was unofficial and the Soviets had not said when they would sign the protocol. <PERSON> Pocar </PERSON> said he received the assurances during `` a workshop at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> organized in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in November.'' <PERSON> Lallah </PERSON> said he also had received unofficial confirmation, and added: `` In October we are going to examine the third periodic -LRB- human rights -RRB- report of the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>, and it is possible that by then the decision will have been taken, or in process of being taken.'' A month ago, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said it would accept <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction in cases based on the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and five other human rights treaties. The decision reversed a long policy of resisting outside judgment of its practices. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantees the individual's right to life; freedom from torture, inhuman or degrading treatment; freedom from slavery or forced labor; freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention; freedom of movement; freedom of thought, conscience and peaceful assembly, and free association. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials praised last month's Soviet policy change but noted that only governments, not individuals, can file legal actions with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, whose formal title is the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooijmans </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special investigator on human rights, said at the time: `` It would be a real breakthrough for human rights if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would recognize the right of individuals'' to file complaints of rights abuses. Under the Optional Protocol, individual citizens can complain of rights abuses to the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, an international body of legal experts with the power to order compensation. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> ratified the protocol last year, joining 40 other nations that recognize it.

 Two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> executives charged with bribery and conspiracy in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud investigation said Thursday they were unaware that a private consultant their company had hired was bribing a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, both former executive vice presidents at <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, also said the consultant, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, had an excellent reputation for his expertise on government contracts. Defense attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuohey </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> about <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, a private consultant that <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, hired to help it secure a lucrative <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contract for hand-held radar equipment. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> has admitted paying bribes to a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official for inside information and has testified for the government. Both <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> have pleaded guilty in the case. Asked Tuohey: `` Did you ever know that Mr. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> was paying off three other people, including <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>?'' `` Absolutely not,'' <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> responded. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> concurred in that view. Kaub, one of three men on trial in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> federal court, was the first defendant to take the witness stand, followed by <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. Also on trial is <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s successor at <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> The three face charges of bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud and making false statements. The government claims they knew <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and his associates were paying bribes to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in order to secure the radar contract. But the defense contends the executives were victims of a conspiracy devised by <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>. The defense is expected to continue Friday, while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has indicated closing arguments will be Monday. Under cross-examination, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> said they never asked <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> about his business partners or sought details about his operation before <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> hired him. `` You have to make an assumption that he was doing legitimate work,'' said <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON>, noting <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> worked for a number of well-known defense contractors. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> told him that other consultants he had hired `` did n't want their names revealed'' to protect other business relationships, so <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> never asked. <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> said he signed the contracts with <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> in November 1985 that called for <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> to receive $ 10,000 to help <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> get permission to bid on the contract. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official, had a good reputation with <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> and told officials there that `` he knew how to present himself, to negotiate, lobby, whatever,'' <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> also said the deal had a subcontract calling for <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> to receive $ 150,000 for future work should <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> be successful in winning the radar job. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> awarded the company the $ 24 million job in July 1987. Although details of <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>'s future work were not spelled out, <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> said the arrangement was not a contingency fee, which is illegal under <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement rules. Asked if he meant to conceal the $ 150,000 arrangement with <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> said, `` Absolutely not. ... If you want to make something illegal, you should hide it, not put it out in public.'' <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> said he had little contact with <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> between 1985 and late 1987. The defendant said he talked to the consultant for a total of about 15 minutes on the telephone and spent about an hour with him at a hotel near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in November 1987. At that meeting, <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> said <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> gave him two reports that might be useful to <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> said he found only one contained valuable information while the other was `` just a bunch of garbage.'' <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> has testified that he indirectly paid money to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> left government in October 1983 after a 17-year career during which, he said, he accepted $ 50,000 in bribes. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> already has pleaded guilty in the government's investigation of fraud and corruption in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s massive procurement program. More than a dozen people have pleaded guilty so far. In earlier testimony Thursday, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, an executive of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he had known of <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>'s work for at least 20 years. `` I gained quite a respect for the man,'' said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, explaining he had known <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> when the latter was a contracting officer with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. `` I thought he was one of the most competent government contracting officers,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said.

 A group led by former baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> agreed Thursday to buy strike-crippled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, and a union spokesman said he was cautiously optimistic the deal could end the month-old walkout. The $ 464 million agreement would give employees a 30 percent share in the company in exchange for wage concessions. The sale by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is subject to approval by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors. Eastern also must reach new work agreements with its striking unions by midnight Tuesday, under terms of the sale. `` Under this agreement, Eastern can be back flying in very short order,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who has been the target of bitter personal attacks from union members. About 500 striking Machinists jammed a union hall in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where Eastern is based, cheering and chanting, `` Take me out to the ball game!'' and `` Hey, hey! Ho, ho! <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s got to go!'' after hearing of the sale. Eastern has been virtually paralyzed since March 4 by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>' strike, which has drawn the support of pilots and flight attendants. Eastern filed March 9 for protection from creditors in bankruptcy court as its cash dried up. `` It's a mammoth challenge,'' said <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>. `` I'm convinced that there is a spirit amongst the people in the company that I can help bring together to help this airline.'' The sale includes <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s highly profitable Northeast shuttle, but <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> will follow through on an earlier agreement to sell the service to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, who stepped down as baseball commissioner Saturday, was vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for two years and founded a travel agency in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1963. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> eventually grew into the second-largest agency in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He was organizer of the 1984 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Olympics, which turned a profit of $ 230 million and put him on the cover of Time magazine as Man of the Year. As baseball commissioner, he turned the game from a $ 67 million-a-year money-loser to one that made $ 100 million last year. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortis </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 702 and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> strike coordinator, said it was impossible to tell whether unions would fare better `` until we get into dealings with Commissioner <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>.'' `` However, we're willing to give it a shot,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying that the union was encouraged but that strike issues had yet to be resolved. `` Nonetheless, what we have heard so far leaves us cautiously optimistic,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, chairman of the 3,600-member union. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> will remain in charge of Eastern until the deal is approved, but <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> will help formulate the reorganization plan. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> would get $ 200 million cash, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> notes worth about $ 185 million, plus <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets valued at about $ 79 million, including <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Montreal </ORGANIZATION> routes plus eight landing slots and one gate at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s group made a $ 464 million offer for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> last week and withdrew it after being told it had been topped by another suitor. But talks with <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s group resumed this week and wound up Thursday. Under the deal, <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON>, another former airline executive from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, would own 30 percent of the airline. Eastern's unions would get another 30 percent in exchange for wage and work-rule concessions. Shares for the remaining 40 percent will be sold to investors. Many union leaders and rank-and-file members have said they would accept concessions to help resurrect Eastern if they were given independence from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which bought the 60-year-old carrier in 1986 for about $ 600 million.

 A majority of telephone users think the seven regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies should be allowed to enter the equipment manufacturing, long-distance and information services markets, according to a survey released Thursday by the telephone companies. In the random survey of 24,291 registered voters, 58 percent agreed that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year should consider lifting the restrictions placed on the Bell companies in the 1984 breakup of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T breakup, the regional phone companies were prohibited from entering the phone equipment research, development and manufacturing business and from providing their own long-distance and information services to local and national customers. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reaffirmed those prohibitions last year, saying the Bell companies, if freed from their restraints, might engage in predatory pricing and cross-subsidization of services and discriminate against competitors wanting to use their phone lines. The court did allow the regional companies to provide `` gateway'' services through which users can call a single 800 number to gain access to a variety of services such as <ORGANIZATION> CompuServe </ORGANIZATION> and The Source databases. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Kennan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, said his company's survey found that `` Americans want American companies freed to compete in providing telecommunications products and services. Consumers want as many choices as possible.'' According to <PERSON> Kennan </PERSON>: _ 74 percent of those surveyed said the seven <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> companies should be allowed to compete in the long-distance arena _ 78 percent thought those companies should be allowed to offer information services, which could include electronic banking, health monitoring, home security services and data bases _ 79 percent said the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies should be allowed to research, develop and manufacture telephone equipment _ 68 percent said the newspaper advertising business does not need to be protected from electronic yellow pages that the Bell companies could offer _ 74 percent said allowing the seven companies to compete in the telephone equipment market would strengthen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness against overseas manufacturers of high technology equipment <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said those surveyed were n't told `` there is already stiff and growing competition for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T'' in manufacturing equipment. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said in a recent speech in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the Bell companies, if allowed to begin manufacturing, might be inclined to team with overseas manufacturers to avoid huge development costs _ to the detriment of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers. <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T never has opposed the Bell companies' entry into the information services business The survey was conducted by telephone from November through January.

 The mercury hit 100 and kept going Thursday as <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sweated out the third day of a record-breaking heat wave that sent thousands to the beach, increased power demand and withered strawberries. <LOCATION> Downtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where the temperature peaked at 105 degrees Wednesday, registered 103 Thursday afternoon, breaking the date's record of 91 set in 1932 and tied in 1962. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>'s 98 made it the hottest April day on record. High pressure over the West squeezed warm air out of the interior toward the populous coast, beating back sea breezes and turning even the usually balmy beaches into a furnace for thousands who rushed there instead of work. `` It started off with 80 degrees at sunrise and now it's up to 98 in the shade,'' said <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> lifeguard <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGregori </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> said power demand to keep up with air conditioning would beat the April record of 14,282 megawatts set Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, the other major local supplier of electricity, projected an April record need for 4,700 megawatts by 4 p.m.. Other hot afternoon readings around <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> included 110 at <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, 108 at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Toro </LOCATION>, 107 at <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, 104 at <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, 102 at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, and 100 at <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> Much of the rest of the state shared the warmth, though not the triple digit readings. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> hit the upper 80s. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grower <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillebrecht </PERSON> watched three acres of strawberries in <LOCATION> Escondido </LOCATION> wither in a 105-degree <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> wind. `` They're really melting in this heat,'' she said. `` You ca n't put enough water on the roots of the plant to keep it from losing moisture. Conversely, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> agricultural biologist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said early warming of the soil would help summer vegetables just being planted. Since Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has sold about 30 tons a day to food and liquor stores, compared to the five or six tons normally delivered daily this time of year, said office manager <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gellert </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> health official, urged people to take precautions ranging from simply wearing hats to spending time in air-conditioned places such as shopping malls and supermarkets. The 61-degree ocean water might deter beachgoers from plunging in, but they should at least keep splashing themselves, <PERSON> Gellert </PERSON> said. `` People going to the beach and not going into the water are just exposing themselves to the sun. ... They may be better off remaining in the shade.'' <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> winds out of the interior began warming the region last weekend. By Tuesday, downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> reached 100 degrees, tying the all-time April record. Even normally cool <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> felt the heat Wednesday with a record high of 88, a full 8 degrees above the previous record that had stood since 1924. At 5 a.m. Thursday the mercury had dropped only to 74 in downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and 88 at <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peak </LOCATION> above Point Mugu in <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Even at 3 a.m. hundreds of people could be found parked along beaches seeking respite. <ORGANIZATION> SoCal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>'s all-time record power use was last September when its 3.8 million central and southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> customers used 15,987 megawatts. The <ORGANIZATION> DWP </ORGANIZATION>'s all time record was 4,991 megawatts on Sept. 6, 1988. Tuesday's usage was 4,073 megawatts and Wednesday's was 4,541 megawatts. Even if high temperatures remain in the same range, power use increases over the span of a heat wave because lack of overnight cooling causes heat buildup in buildings, requiring more power to start up air conditioning each day.

 A truck driver who ignored a signal gate crashed into an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> commuter train on Thursday, causing a derailment that injured 58 people, authorities said. In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, a second accident involving an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train left 26 people hurt. Most of the injuries in both derailments appeared to be minor, officials said. In a third accident in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, a freight train derailed and hit tanks containing farm pesticides and fertilizers, releasing chemical fumes that forced evacuation of 1,300 students from nearby schools for two hours, police said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, a police radio operator, said the <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> train apparently ran off the end of a rail spur and struck two trucks behind a grain elevator and fertilizer company owned by <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. One woman was in satisfactory condition at <ORGANIZATION> Gibson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after being splattered with the chemicals She suffered irritation of the skin and eyes in the 8:30 a.m. accident, officials said. In <LOCATION> Lemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, the gate was down and warning signals were activated when the commuter train collision occurred about 7:25 a.m. some 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, said Will County Sheriff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnsen </PERSON>. `` The indication is that the driver of the truck ignored the signals and drove around the gates,'' <PERSON> Johnsen </PERSON> said. The train carried 98 people. The collision tore off the rear axle of the truck and its storage bin, carrying it down the tracks about a quarter of a mile, officials said. The truck driver, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sauk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, was listed in fair condition at <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>. Three others were reported in fair condition at the hospital. `` I was reading my newspaper, and all of a sudden, I just heard a loud boom,'' said passenger <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaynish </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>. `` The lights went out, and a couple of seconds later, it felt like we were going through a bumpy field.'' None of the passengers in his car appeared to be injured, <PERSON> Kaynish </PERSON> said. People in the first car were covered `` from head to toe'' with dust from the gravel, he said. The train carried 98 passengers. Damage to equipment amounted to at least $ 1 million, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapton </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Metra </ORGANIZATION> commuter rail line in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He said one of the passenger cars was totally destroyed and the others required repair. Damage to the locomotive would not be assessed until it could be righted, he said. In addition, the collision `` chewed up about 750 feet of track that will have to be replaced,'' <PERSON> Knapton </PERSON> said. The track belongs to <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Officials from <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, which also uses the line, said trains between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> were rerouted. In the second passenger accident, six cars and both engines of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train carrying 519 passengers derailed near the <LOCATION> Virginia-North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> border, authorities and witnesses said. The derailment occurred at 2:08 p.m. near Skippers, about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> supervisor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. The train was traveling from <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Six people with minor injuries were admitted to <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>. Twenty people, most of them complaining of back and neck pains, were treated at <ORGANIZATION> Greensville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Emporia </LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON>. One woman was transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> for treatment of a back injury; another woman was admitted to <LOCATION> Greensville </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON> said he did n't know the extent of her injuries. The cause of the derailment was not known, said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Senators Urge Delay of Plan to Abolish Crime Strike Force</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bipartisan group of four senators asked Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on Thursday to delay any plans to abolish the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, saying such a move could `` hamper federal law enforcement capabilities.'' `` Given the success of the <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> over the past 20 years, we believe that a decision to abolish the strike forces could hamper federal law enforcement capabilities at a time when many areas are overwhelmed with organized crime and illegal drug activity,'' the letter said. The letter _ signed by <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> as well as Republicans <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ was delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had left for the day, said aide <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. Recently, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` has said he was leaning in favor of merging those offices into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys' offices,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` He said he felt that would enhance the federal efforts against organized crime.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys around the country have recommended _ unanimously, according to <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> _ that the strike forces `` be assimilated into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys' offices.'' The recommendation is under review by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criminal division and is expected to be forwarded to <LOCATION> Thornburgh </LOCATION> soon, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` A lot of the organized crime business these days is, in fact, drugs, and when you fence the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys out of those cases, that does n't seem to be the right thing to do,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` It seems appropriate to merge them and have one federal prosecutor rather than two federal prosecutors in the same parts of the country.'' There are strike forces in about two dozen major cities around the country. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> noted that the strike force in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was merged with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> several years ago. `` Under the past three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was the most active in the country in the fight against organized crime,'' he said. The senators noted that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has said in speeches and in testimony before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that `` some of the reasons giving rise to the establishment of organized crime strike forces still apply, including the need for seasoned prosecutors who can commit the time necessary to prepare these cases and who are free of daily criminal docket obligations.'' The 1988 drug bill, they wrote, included a provision requiring a comprehensive reorganization study that should be completed in several months. `` A decision as important as this would benefit from the results of that study,'' the letter said. `` Accordingly, we urge you to delay any such decision until the appropriate committees of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have reasonable time to consider your proposal. We pledge to do so expeditiously.''

 Influential Palestinians expressed skepticism Thursday about President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Israeli officials, however, said they were encouraged by the outcome of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told his aides his meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Thursday was `` an excellent meeting, more than I ever expected,'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported. Other Israeli reports indicated <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> disagreed with the Americans on some issues, notably the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand to stop Jewish settlement in the occupied lands. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> journalists reporting from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as saying a timetable for discussing the elections idea will be set in the next few days. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said joint <LOCATION> U.S-Israeli </LOCATION> teams will be created to work out concrete proposals leading to elections. `` I think that in general, the positive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to the elections idea is encouraging and raising hopes,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Some Palestinians expressed the fear that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposed elections as a ploy to sidestep the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and block its key demand that a Palestinian state be created. `` I believe it's a trick because I do n't believe the Israelis want true peace,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Khazmo </PERSON>, editor of the pro-PLO weekly <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayader </PERSON> <PERSON> Assiyasi </PERSON>. `` If they did, they would go to an international conference and accept the idea of land for peace,'' <PERSON> Khazmo </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where his newspaper is published. Also Thursday, a Palestinian died of a gunshot wound sustained in earlier violence, and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier shot and critically wounded a teen-age protester in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, witnesses and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. In other clashes in the occupied lands, troops shot and wounded at least eight Palestinians. Doctors at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, 27, of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, died Thursday of head wounds sustained during a clash with troops March 30. Chanting `` PLO! <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> No!'' about 200 people in <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> waved outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and followed <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>'s coffin. His death brings to 420 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation started in December 1987. Eighteen Israelis also have died. In nearby <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, reporters watched four soldiers fire live ammunition to disperse 100 Palestinians who were throwing stones and bottles. One soldier chased 17-year-old <PERSON> Dahoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Nassar </PERSON>. He knelt on the ground, took aim, and shot the youth in the head twice from about 40 yards away. An army spokesman confirmed a Palestinian youth was wounded, but denied a live bullet hit <PERSON> Nassar </PERSON>, who was in critical condition at <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Army regulations permit troops to fire live ammunition only when their lives are in danger. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election proposal was the main idea he brought to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to help resolve the conflict that has provoked much criticism of Israeli army methods. Leading <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporters in the occupied territories did not rule out elections, but said balloting must be part of a comprehensive peace plan, including a timetable for negotiations on a final settlement. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>, a human rights activist in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said as a prerequisite for elections, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would have to lift military orders banning freedom of expression for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands.

 Leftist rebels attacked two major military bases in a nationwide offensive Thursday and asked the right-wing victors in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s presidential election to declare themselves a transition government. The rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said its drive came in response to a surge in repression following the victory by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or Arena, in March 19 elections. A communique from the rebel general command accused Arena of sponsoring the repression. In a proposal issued separately in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the rebels asked the incoming <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> government for broad talks embracing government, rebels, the military and all political parties. It said <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> should declare itself a transitional government until new elections can be held. `` Without negotiations no one can govern <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' it warned. There was no immediate reaction to the offer. Authorities said at least 10 people died and 12 were wounded at the 4th Army Brigade headquarters in northern <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> province and at the army engineers base in <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Farabundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> proposal demanded a massive cut in the armed forces and an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. It came on the eve of a meeting between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Salvadoran president-elect, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. The two are expected to discuss <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> demands for an improved human rights situation in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The administration expects to have trouble getting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve further aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> unless the human rights situation improves here. The rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos, discussing the offensive, said `` Arena is clearly implementing a policy of capturing popular movement leaders and activists.'' The communique warned that `` every repressive action will receive a telling response from us.'' Arena has been linked to right-wing death squads and security force extremists that killed thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s. Arena leaders deny any role in the rightist terror. Union and student activists have disappeared or been killed since the March 19 elections. But human rights groups consulted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said they do not have enough information to document a postelection surge in rightist violence. The national teachers' union, <LOCATION> ANDES </LOCATION>, on Thursday denounced the slaying of <PERSON> Cristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, a 40-year-old union member and teacher at the capital's <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> school. A union statement said heavily armed men in civilian clothes forced her into a dark-windowed Jeep Cherokee when she left school at midday Wednesday. Her body was discovered with two bullets in the head that afternoon. Dark-windowed Cherokees are a trademark of right-wing death squads. Col. <PERSON> Ciro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Roque </PERSON>, commander of the 4th Brigade in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION>, 37 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said three soldiers and three guerrillas died in a predawn attack and five soldiers were wounded. He said the rebels did not penetrate the brigade's perimeter, but several mortar shells landed inside Guerrillas also attacked military engineers in <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>, 35 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Canjura </PERSON>, the post commander, said seven civilians were wounded when homemade guerrilla artillery fell short of the military installation. He said three soldiers were killed pursuing retreating rebels. Canjura and <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> spoke to the AP by telephone. The new rebel proposal, directed to the `` future government of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> could either intensify the war or assume the role of a transitional government to peace. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said repeatedly the rebels must lay down arms before negotiations take place, something the <PERSON> Farabundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> regards as tantamount to surrender. The <PERSON> Farabundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> called for talks on political, military and economic matters with the Arena government, the armed forces and all political parties. It proposed a negotiated cease-fire, to be followed in six months by elections for a new president, mayors nationwide and a constituent assembly to rewrite <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s 6-year-old consititution. The proposal said the <PERSON> Farabundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> would participate in elections as a party in its own right, not as a supporter of existing parties or coalitions as the rebels suggested in a January proposal that was rejected. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who has terminal liver cancer, is to hand over power to <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> on June 1. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s physician, Dr. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Saca </PERSON>, said Thursday that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s condition had worsened but he could return to work next week.

 A document produced at <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial Thursday depicted <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ for the first time _ as helping carry out the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret program to sustain the Nicaraguan Contras when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had forbidden <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. Then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> served as an intermediary for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in assuring the president of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in the spring of 1985 of expedited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and economic aid, according to a 42-page `` admission of facts'' agreed to by the government and read to the jury by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense attorneys. The document established a `` quid pro quo'' relationship between continuing third-country assistance to the Contras and the availability of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to those countries. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not described in the document as having cited such a linkage in his May 1985 meeting with then-President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The document, nevertheless, revealed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as actually playing a role in the effort to keep the Contras alive as a fighting force during the period of the Boland Amendment prohibition on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> involvement. This is a portrait of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that never emerged in the final Iran-Contra investigative reports by a presidential review board and a joint congressional committee. Asked Thursday about the revelation of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s go-between role with the <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> leader who was being pressed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to continue helping the Contras, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` We ca n't say anything. It would become a part of the case.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined to comment on the document when asked about it at a dinner party for visiting <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had n't seen the document, `` and I do n't worry about it.'' Both the presidential commission, headed by former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, and the congressional panels, found no meaningful role by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the scandal that resulted from the covert sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the subsequent diversion of the proceeds to the Nicaraguan resistance fighters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that he supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Iranian arms-sale initiative, but that he voiced reservations about what would happen if it ever became public. Portions of the document read Thursday did, however, show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as an enthusiastic supporter of the effort to tide over the Contras until direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance could be resumed. In early March 1985, for instance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked then-national security advisor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> to say whether he -LRB- the vice president -RRB- should `` encourage a private group to donate a planeload of medical supplies that would arrive in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> coincident with'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strongly favored such a flight,'' the document said, `` noting that the -LRB- unidentified -RRB- group was supportive of the resistance.'' It said that <PERSON> North </PERSON> told <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s idea was a sound one. The document did not reveal whether the planeload of supplies actually arrived in conjunction with his visit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has denied ever having any knowledge of a diversion of arms-sales proceeds to the Contras. And <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, national security adviser to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was vice president, has testified that he did not pass on to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> information about Contra resupply effort that <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> had learned from <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a one-time <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> associate. A source involved in the Iran-Contra congressional investigation, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said Thursday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` did n't leave very many footprints anywhere. It needs to be said that the extent of his knowledge was not our major goal. We were more interested in what the president -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- knew.'' But this source also said that `` it was because he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- left so few footprints, I think, that he was treated so well in the -LRB- final investigative -RRB- report'' by the congressional panel. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at the Honduran Embassy here, said she had no information about the <LOCATION> Bush-Suazo </LOCATION> meeting. But she said, `` The embassy would not have been involved.'' According to the document, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally told <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> during the May 1985 in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> that extra aid was being funneled to his country. In earlier testimony, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> had said the aid was part of a secret agreement calling for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to help the Contras. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> personally approved the secret deal to slip $ 110 million in extra aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> as one of several `` quid pro quo'' arrangements with other countries in exchange for support for the Contras. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said in cross-examination that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> to gain the release of an arms shipment to the Contras that had been seized by a Honduran military commander. The statement entered in court Thursday said: `` Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also informed <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had directed that currently withheld economic assistance for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> should be released, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would provide from its own military stocks critical security assistance items that had been ordered by Honduran armed forces, and that several security programs under way for <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> security forces would be enhanced.'' In a Dec. 3, 1986 speech to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> here _ little more than a week after the Iran-Contra affair broke into public view _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that while he was aware of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Iranian initiative and had supported it, `` I was not aware of _ and oppose _ any diversion of funds, any ransom payments or any circumvention of the will of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The document also revealed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saw several North memoranda involving the secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to aid the Contras, although it did not contradict <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assertions that he never knew about the diversion of the Iranian arms-sales proceeds to the resistance. At another point, the document shows that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was included in the distribution of a memo making it clear that leaders of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> were conditioning continued support for the Contras on a doubling of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic assistance to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Ravens to Die in Effort to Save Desert Tortoise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal officials plan to shoot and poison up to 1,500 ravens in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> in an effort to save the desert tortoise, which is a favorite meal of the predatory birds. Animal damage control officers with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> will kill ravens by injecting hard-boiled eggs with poison and placing the eggs on elevated platforms where the ravens will find and eat them. The ravens are killing young tortoises by the thousands and contributing to an alarming decline of tortoise populations in the desert, said biologists with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that developed the raven control program. <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> officials obtained a permit this week from the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to kill the birds, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernardino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. The birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The permit represents the largest sanctioned killing of ravens in the Western states, said Agent <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> of the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> officials oppose the program and local <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> officials called it short-sighted and excessive. `` I'm a little annoyed at this,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernardino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` In general the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> is not doing its job throughout the desert on a variety of levels. ... It bothers me that they are now having to go to these extremes to eliminate or reduce a population.'' Roads, dumps, homes, power lines and sewage plants in the desert have helped boost raven populations 15-fold during the last two decades, <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> biologists said. The $ 50,000 raven control program, set to begin within the next two weeks, will last about four months and will be conducted in three areas, including the Desert Tortoise Natural Area preserve near <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Rado </PERSON>, a wildlife biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. The bait platforms, at least four feet high, will prevent other animals such as kit foxes and coyotes from eating the poisoned eggs, <PERSON> Rado </PERSON> said. Ravens die within 24 to 48 hours after eating the poison. Officials plan to shoot ravens and capture some with nets fired from cannons to supplement the poisoning program. Ravens favor tortoises seven years old and younger because their fingernail-thin shells are easily punctured with their beaks. As more and more young tortoises are eaten, fewer reach maturity and the adult reproductive population shrinks. In two studies, <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> biologists attributed 88 percent of tortoise deaths to ravens. But critics remain skeptical that ravens can cause so much damage.

<HEAD>Arafat Says Assassination Squads Seek PLO Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was quoted Wednesday as saying assassination squads have been deployed in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries to kill Palestinian leaders. The editor-in-chief of the London-based weekly Al-Majalla quoted <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> as saying the teams of killers are of different nationalities, including one Palestinian. `` There are three groups, but according to the names available to me only one person involved is a Palestinian and the rest belong to other nationalities,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` There have always been such attempts perpetrated by the Israelis, international intelligence agencies and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> agents.'' There was no elaboration. Excerpts from the interview ran in the weekly's Jidda-based, sister English-language newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, which is sold in <LOCATION> Manama </LOCATION>. According to the publication, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the assassination efforts were aimed at halting progress after last year's peace initiative by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> led to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lifting a 13-year ban on dealing with the guerrilla organization. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also was quoted as saying he did not provide information to the Americans that could help disclose the identity of the terrorists who planted a bomb aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet which blew up in December over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` We have n't reached such type of coordination with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, he was quoted as saying, was not ready to cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in combating terrorism under the definition now being applied to the word `` because it is we who are victims of state terrorism.'' The definition has been considered controversial because the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> insists any attacks on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military targets are legitimate resistance, since Israeli forces occupy the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> where a Palestinian state is foreseen. But <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was quoted as stressing in the interview: `` We refuse to blow up aircraft or kill civilians because these are crimes against humanity and those responsible for them should receive no mercy.'' The report quoted <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> as saying he believed the dialogue between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> reflected `` seriousness ... by the American administration in seeking fruitful results that would give a strong push to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peacemaking process.'' According to the publication, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief reiterated the standing <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> request for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces to replace the Israelis in the occupied territories. When asked if he would accept the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces instead, as an <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> aide recently suggested, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was quoted as saying he would have to convene the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to consider the proposal. The Central Council is a liaison body between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership and its legislative body, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The report said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was interviewed in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> before the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> elected him as president of the self-proclaimed independent Palestinian state.

<TEXT>
 Officials said Wednesday they broke up a major international counterfeit ring, confiscating $ 12 million in counterfeit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency and arresting a West German and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> accomplice. The counterfeiters had operated since at least 1987 and their bogus money has turned up in several <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities and in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> prosecutors' office <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON> said investigators seized 235 pounds of counterfeit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> $ 100 bills with a total face value of $ 12 million. He said it was the largest seizure of counterfeit money in West German history. Printing machines and high-quality paper used by the counterfeiters were also confiscated in raids March 20 in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and the surrounding area, <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON> said. Two of the counterfeit ring's alleged organizers _ a 49-year-old Israeli and a 43-year-old West German businessman from the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> area _ were arrested, and an arrest warrant was issued for a third suspect, <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON> said. The spokesman refused to provide further information on any of the suspects. According to Schroers, West German authorities received their first clues about the counterfeiters in 1987 when they heard the ring wanted to circulate a large amount of their bogus money. `` We knew no more than that, until late summer 1988 when the first hundred or so hundred-dollar bills surfaced in various European cities, especially <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but also in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' Schroers said. He said that American and Israeli authorities provided information about links between the counterfeitiers operating in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with another ring that was active in 1983 and 1984. <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON> said equipment used by the earlier group had come from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON>, a member of the earlier ring who is now in jail in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> gave authorities information that led to the arrest of the Israeli man suspected of involvement in the new ring of counterfeiters. West German police confiscated the printing equipment, paper and counterfeit bills in raids on two residences and a business in the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> area, <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 No B-1B bombers will fly until their escape hatches are inspected in the wake of two instances in which the hatches flew off, the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday Asked if the planes had been grounded again, Col. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SAC </ORGANIZATION>'s director of public affairs at <ORGANIZATION> Offutt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, said: `` That's your word. I did n't use that word. `` At the moment they are inspecting all of the airplanes. We expect that will be completed and they will be flying again late -LRB- Thursday -RRB- afternoon.'' Ejection hatches on two B-1B bombers from <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, mysteriously blew off during training flights just a day apart, a base official said Wednesday. No one was hurt in either incident, Maj. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> said. `` At this time, both incidents are under investigation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> said. `` They're looking at them now, but there's no evidence to link these two -LRB- incidents -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said about 40 of the 97 planes had been returned to flying status following last week's inspections, which focused on sweeping wings. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had placed B-1B bombers back in training service just Monday, after canceling training runs for a week because of a March 27 incident in which another Dyess-based B-1B punctured a fuel tank because of a malfunction in its moveable wing. The first hatch-blowing incident occurred about 11 a.m. Tuesday as the jet was climbing from a low-altitude exercise near the <LOCATION> Texas-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> border, Ms. <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> said. The 3-foot by 4-foot hatch blew off at about 12,500 feet. About 11:45 a.m. Wednesday, a hatch in the same place on another B-1B blew off at about 19,000 feet as the jet flew over La Junta Training Range near <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> said. Both airplanes returned to <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> for routine landings, she said. Both hatches were above the offensive systems operator's seat, on the right rear side of the cockpit. The B-1B regularly carries four crew members, and each _ the pilot, co-pilot, offensive systems operator and defensive systems operator _ has his own ejection hatch. The hatch is one or two feet above the crew member's head. `` When they're in there, -LRB- crew members -RRB- have got their helmets on and they're strapped in,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> said, adding that the loss of the hatches did n't affect either plane's flight. The metal hatches fell over unpopulated areas, and neither had been recovered by Wednesday afternoon. Officials with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ the plane's manufacturer _ were inspecting the aircraft Wednesday, Ms. <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> said. The B-1B has been the most maligned aircraft in service history, with controversy over the plane's electronic defense system and the moveable wings. The planes have been grounded three times in the past 18 months.

<HEAD>Why Housing's Troops Are On The Alert</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Under current tax law, a homeowner may deduct interest on a home mortgage loan as large as $ 1 million, an amount far beyond the borrowing ability of most middle-class Americans. Despite this, real estate and home building organizations are determined not to let the million dollar `` cap'' be reduced by a single dollar, defending their stand as being in the interest of middle-class homeowners. Taking a `` stand'' does n't begin to suggest their determination. Leaders of housing-related industries sound these days like military commanders determined to give no ground. They have made up their minds, they have drawn the line. It is $ 1 million. For <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to tamper with deductibility, says <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Colton </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, would be to risk a taxpayer rebellion. He says it could `` strike at the heart of middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, is equally concerned. `` Guarding against threats to homeownership and private property rights in general is similar to manning a fire station,'' he said recently. `` You have to be on duty all the time, not just when there's a fire.'' Few issues have ever fired up the two industries to such an extent. Nearly 20,000 Realtors have sent letters to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seeking his help against the threat. It has been made a plank in the Home Builders Statement of Policy. Many people think the alert is overdone, that the vigilance is uncalled for. If there is a threat, they say, it is hardly a visible one. Even before his election, the president endorsed the tax deduction as it now stands and has given no indication of changing his mind. And <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members have given their assurances that no changes are likely. The Realtors say the office of Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tex </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has said the subject is off the table, or not up for reconsideration. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has said in reference to the maximum, $ 1 million deductibility, `` As long as I'm chairman, it's going to remain where it is. As if that were n't assurance enough, more than 100 representatives have endorsed a resolution `` that it is the sense of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the current law regarding the Federal income tax deduction for interest on debt secured by a first or second home should not be further restricted.'' So why worry? Because, say real estate and housing people, the income tax deduction on home mortgage debt already has been limited twice in the past three years. It can happen again, they say, easily and quickly. Says Gribin: `` Just as the best time to put out a fire is before it has a chance to really get started, the best time to defend against a potentially disastrous piece of legislation is before it garners a lot of support.'' And <PERSON> Colton </PERSON>: `` The great concern is the foot in the door.'' Once the barrier is lowered, he says, it can be lowered more easily in the future, again and again until deductibility is eliminated altogether. He has other reasons too. Unless the allowable deduction is cut to a small fraction of the existing $ 1 million limit, he says, the revenues produced would hardly be significant. He also contends that whatever revenues are generated would be offset by those lost through a decline in new-home construction. `` As long as the decision is made in full view of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public, the deductibility will be kept,'' he states. `` The trouble is that a lot of deals are made in closed rooms.'' He wants to ward off that possibility. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubar </PERSON>, a Realtor spokesman, offers an even more succinct explanation for having the troops on alert. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must be watched, he suggests, because `` all it takes is a pen to scratch out one zero and $ 1 million goes to $ 100,000.''

 In 25 years on the force, city police Officer <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Chuderewicz </PERSON> has worked race riots and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War protests and arrested drug pushers, rapists and car thieves. The 6-foot-1, 205-pound officer has gotten by with nary a scratch until a militant, anti-abortion organization began waging guerrilla warfare at women's clinics in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Now Chuderewicz is on disability leave for several weeks, recovering from surgery for a hernia he suffered during a February protest while trying to arrest the local leader of Operation Rescue. `` It gets me a little bit ticked off,'' said <PERSON> Chuderewicz </PERSON>, 56, who has n't suffered a job-related injury since 1966. `` At the first protest, I fell down and darn near rolled under a bus.'' He is one of six city officers on long-term disability and one of 50 officers who have been injured since June, when Operation Rescue added three of the city's women's clinics to its anti-abortion protest targets around the country. In less than a year, police Chief <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pampena </PERSON> estimates more than 1,330 abortion foes have been arrested, and the protests have cost the police department roughly $ 100,000, including $ 30,000 in compensation claims. Officials have become so frustrated they're considering using a racketeering law against the protesters to recoup their costs. In <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, as elsewhere, the group has turned demonstrations into confrontations because protesters use whatever methods possible _ including chaining themselves to doors _ to prevent access to abortion clinics. Such tactics have clouded the issue, critics say. `` The tactics are becoming more important than the issue itself,'' said <PERSON> Pampena </PERSON>. `` The issue now is between the police and the demonstrators. It's no longer focused on the issue of abortion.'' But the Rev. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON>, the local leader of <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, said the group's methods are necessary to save lives. `` I genuinely feel bad that any police officer has been hurt. That bothers me and I wish I could undo it. But children are dying. That's the consequence,'' said <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, who resigned as pastor of his evangelical church to work full time for the movement. <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON> argued that police have `` drawn themselves into this cross fire'' by using excessive force with demonstrators. `` The treatment is far rougher than needed.'' In a demonstration, protesters use passive resistance _ going limp and requiring police to carry them to paddy wagons _ in order to delay their arrest and, in turn, delay possible abortions. Most of the injured officers' ailments involve back and groin problems caused by lifting dozens of protesters, <PERSON> Pampena </PERSON> said. Hoping to save strain on his officers, the chief said he offered demonstration leaders the option of having a person arrested every 45 seconds, the time it would take to carry someone away; those arrested would have to cooperate by walking. `` That way they're still getting the same amount of time, nobody's being harassed, nobody's being accused of brutality,'' <PERSON> Pampena </PERSON> said. `` But they refused. They said that's not in their plan.'' <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON> argued that protesters originally asked police for such an agreement, but it was they who refused. Now, he said, Operation Rescue members are not as conciliatory because many claim they've been victims of police brutality. `` After people have been beaten up and molested, I do n't know what incentive they have to get up and walk away now,'' he said. Once arrested, demonstrators often continue to use passive resistance. On several occasions, they've tied up city courts for hours and days by refusing to give their names, calling themselves `` Baby Does'' to identify with the children they say are being murdered by abortion. <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail Warden <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozakiewicz </PERSON> said the county's expenses following a March 11 demonstration totaled more than $ 15,000 because the activists withheld their names for 33 hours to protest assault charges lodged against one of their members. Due to overcrowding at the jail, 60 women were held overnight in the jail's gymnasium and 62 men were kept in police holding cells until an unused building at <LOCATION> Mayview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> could be prepared. <PERSON> Kozakiewicz </PERSON> said the women continued to remain limp upon arrival at the jail, forcing guards to hold their heads erect for photographing and drag them up five flights of steps to the gymnasium. `` The whole process was time-consuming,'' the warden said. `` Some of the officers suffered injury. Some of these women _ how can I say it? _ were large.'' Operation Rescue organizers claim the women were fondled and sexually harassed by jail guards and strip-searched by male guards. <PERSON> Kozakiewicz </PERSON> said he is troubled by those charges, saying the women were treated with dignity and respect. He said female corrections officers strip-searched only a few women, and the only time male officers became involved was when women had to be dragged upstairs to the gym. `` It's devastating because you put your best foot forward,'' he said. `` Lord knows, they may have a champion in me in their cause. But it's certainly frustrating to me to have to carry and drag people in the jail. The point is not to be proved here.'' <PERSON> Pampena </PERSON> said he has issued memos to police officers instructing them to be as gentle as possible in dealing with protesters. `` We know we're not dealing with the criminal element and I have no animosity toward them or their cause,'' he said. `` My police officers are probably split 50-50 on the issue.'' Officials at the abortion clinics say they are pleased with the job police have done. Meanwhile, attorneys representing the building that houses the <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> have sued <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON> and more than 40 other people, claiming they have harmed the building's reputation among its 28 tenants and discouraged potential tenants. The suit says the protesters violated the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act because their blockades `` constitute extortion and the interference with commerce by threats or violence.'' The county law department is investigating whether <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> can apply the RICO act to recoup its costs of overtime, medical treatment for police and housing prisoners arrested in demonstrations. But Operation Rescue spokesman <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brough </PERSON> said neither lawsuits nor restraining orders will stop the protests. `` They want us to run away in fear, but we can not,'' <PERSON> Brough </PERSON> said. `` We have made a promise to God that we wo n't be deterred, whether by police brutality, tyrannical judges or unjust laws.''

 Having trouble getting your act together in time to meet the April 17 income-tax deadline? Consider joining the 6 million or so of your fellow citizens who are turning for help to Form 4868 -LRB- Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Indiviudual Income Tax Return -RRB-. Complete this form properly, mail it to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and you'll get four more months, until Aug. 15, to complete your annual accounting with Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. There's one catch to this, however. Extension of time to file does not mean extension of time to pay. With Form 4868, the rules stipulate, you need to enclose a check big enough to ensure that at least 90 percent of your eventual tax bill for 1988 is paid. If you do n't meet that standard, you can run into a wide variety of woes, including penalties for late payment and a possible ruling that invalidates your extension request altogether. So if you're uncertain how much your tax is likely to run, it makes sense when estimating it to err on the high side. The trouble is, that means you're probably going to wind up giving the government the free use of some of your money for at least several months. Drawbacks notwithstanding, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> says 5.7 million taxpayers filed for extensions in the tax filing season last year. For this year, it is projecting that 6.2 million will do so. There used to be another way to duck the deadline, and to postpone the need to pay as well. All you had to do was be out of the country, defined as the 50 states and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, on April 15. That qualified you for an extra two months to file and pay. `` This was the easiest extension to get and particularly useful to some taxpayers who were not in a position to determine what their tax liability was going to be,'' observed <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Holub </PERSON>, managing partner in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> office of the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Laventhol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horwath </ORGANIZATION>. About a year ago, a clever thinker in an airline's marketing department hit on the idea of promoting its flights to other countries as a way of getting this break. But the idea was too clever in the eyes of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, which immediately began a crackdown. Now the only people eligible for the extension are those who live outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including members of the armed forces stationed in other lands. `` It eliminated a very handy device,'' <PERSON> Holub </PERSON> said. For people who will be traveling abroad this year, he adds, it is now necessary either to get your return in on time or file a Form 4868 before you depart. Some tax mavens advise getting an extension even if you can meet the original deadline, as a way of reducing your chances of being audited. No, say others, it is best to file in April, when there is safety in numbers. Ignore this debate, counsels the <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guide </ORGANIZATION>: `` Both theories are oversimplifications of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> procedures.''

<HEAD>What Constitutes A Good Board? ^Eds: Fixes spelling of Zehnder in
grafs 17 and 19</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Asked what proportion of votes at corporate board meetings are unanimous, 85 percent of a select group of directors agreed that virtually all are. Because management generally selects or greatly influences the issues on which votes are taken, and because most directors have relatively little time to study board matters, the question arises again: What good is a board? It is an ages-old question, asked over and over. Times change, and the board's role evolves. But in spite of studies, conferences, learned papers and the like, never has the issue been put to rest. It probably never will be. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Geneen </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> chairman, has been quoted as saying a board should sit in judgment of management, especially the chief executive, `` and to reward, punish or replace the management as the board sees fit.'' But he added: `` That is what is supposed to happen. That is what appears to happen. But it does n't.'' And for good reason: As board chairman, the chief generally is the one who selects members, and the agenda as well. In recent years, boards have become more involved. And, because of court suits and other evidence of shareholder suits, boards today have a tendency to be more aware of their obligation to shareholders. But the questions not only persist, they grow more numerous. For example, institutions have grown enormously in the past two decades. Mutual funds and pension funds have become big owners of stock, and on many days they dominate activity on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Question: Should such institutions have board seats? It's a good bet that the ordinary folks whose money makes up these funds would be inclined to say `` yes,'' reasoning that they are entitled to representation. But a lot of corporate executives do n't see it that way. In the same survey that indicated most board votes are unanimous _ by <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zehnder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm _ only 12 of 102 directors thought institutions should be represented. In fact, many of the directors interviewed, all of whom serve very large corporations and 60 percent of whom are chief executives of other companies, consider institutional influence a growing danger to corporate governance. Underscoring that view, 50 percent of them agreed with the statement, `` The power of institutional investors in corporate governance is growing out of proportion and something should be done about it.'' Said one: `` Institutional investors do n't belong on corporate boards _ they're only concerned with quick profits, not the long-term health of the corporation.'' Who then is concerned with long-term health, management or insiders? Outsiders, such as widely knowledgeable educators or chief executives of other companies? Outsiders who own shares? Outsiders who own little or no stock? You may have strong views on those questions, but chances are that your views are offset by others with equally strong but opposite opinions. In the <ORGANIZATION> Zehnder </ORGANIZATION> survey, four of 10 directors opposed the seating of insiders. While acknowledging the valuable hands-on experience of corporate officers, one of the directors contended: `` Since it is only human nature to want to save your own job, management who serve on boards can not be expected to have the best interests of the shareholders in mind in takeover situations.'' Representatives of small shareholders have long argued at annual meetings that all board members should own stock in the company, and most of the directors in the <ORGANIZATION> Zehnder </ORGANIZATION> survey agreed. They suggested, however, that stock ownership is not a requirement for being a good director. Seven in 10 agreed that directors are likely to have the same commitment to shareholder interests regardless of their equity holdings. You may disagree, as millions of others disagree. It is the reason why the issue of what makes a good board might never get settled.

<HEAD>After 70 Years, Organization Finds Problems Harder to Solve</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Back in the 1920s, the leaders of the fledgling <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> raised cash by hocking their rings and pearls at a friendly <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> pawn shop. The shop's operator held the goods until the organization was on its feet and the ladies of the league had the cash to redeem their valuables. Or so goes the story, oft told by the officers of today's League of Women Voters. At 70, the league finds the solutions to its problems more difficult to come by. The non-partisan league, dedicated still to promoting political and civic activism, is working to reverse a decline in members and end the financial squeeze that has forced it to draw from its endowment to cover operating losses. It has cut expenses, laid off staff, reduced its lobbying efforts and de-emphasized a range of issues it was active in yet distracted by. Aggravating the deficit was last fall's presidential debate debacle, which culminated when the league angrily withdrew its sponsorship of the final debate between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a dispute over format and details. That move generated much sympathy around the country but renewed and intensified hostility toward the league among partisans of both parties. Yet, the troubles facing the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> run deeper. It is in some ways a victim of the success and achievement of a generation of active, educated and assertive women _ like the ones who hocked their jewels to pay the bills _ and of the social change that has moved women away from volunteer work to jobs that pay. `` The woman who was the heart and soul of the league volunteer is now an investment banker,'' says <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, the league's first male executive director To meet the changing social and financial demands, the organization's board of trustees agreed in January to a long-term refocusing of the league's efforts. Its top priorities now are public campaign financing and a project called `` Advocate for the Voter,'' which aims at increasing voter registration and turnout. The move essentially was a return to the sort of issues that concerned the league when it sprang from the women's suffrage movement in 1919. `` Our goals are the same, but the strategies to reach them are going to have to change,'' says <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, the league's national president `` We've got to accommodate people who have very busy and complicated lives, but who still want to be active and try to change things.'' The league's strength is its 1,150 local organizations in communities in every state, where members monitor obscure government proceedings, promote voter registration and push league positions on a plethora of concerns. Some have seen that wide range of issues as a problem. `` A blue million of'em,'' former league president <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridings </PERSON> says of the issues the league has tried to deal with: arms control, abortion, clean water, defense spending, child care, housing and tax reform to name a few. `` Over the years, we've simply tried to become all things to all people. With the best of intentions, but it's stretched us thinner and thinner,'' said <PERSON> Ridings </PERSON>, now publisher of the <LOCATION> Bradenton </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. The league describes its own positions as progressive. Some say they are liberal. `` While they say they're non-partisan, they tend to support positions that most clearly follow Democratic lines,'' says <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON>, the former Republican national chairman who tangled with the league over the debates. `` They're basically liberal.'' The league is strictly bound to its grass-roots orientation _ so much so that it did n't even have a reliable national membership list when <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was hired four years ago. Since then, the league has spent heavily on modernization, bringing computers into the operation and installing its first modern financial system. The financing problems are real. Budgets for the league and its educational fund have fallen over the last decade; corporate donations are down, and the league has spent $ 1 million over the last several years from its reserves, now at about $ 1.5 million. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> says last year's losses, including those from the debate fiasco, will hit about $ 800,000. With cost controls, he hopes the league will end its fiscal year with a deficit of $ 200,000 to $ 400,000 on an operating budget of $ 6.8 million. To control costs, the league in January dismissed two workers, one a lobbyist on Capitol Hill; left vacancies unfilled, and cut back its publications. Officials acknowledge that the changes, particularly the de-emphasis on selected issues, have created tensions between headquarters and members. Years of declining membership _ despite the acceptance of men as members in 1974 _ is another problem. Membership grew 10 percent last year, reversing a decade of decline, due primarily to a new but costly direct-mail campaign to solicit members. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> says mailings cost as much as the dues they brought in; the payoff will come only if those members renew. Membership in the still-predominately female organization reached a peak of about 150,000 in the mid-1970s and is now about 107,000. Of all its problems and controversies, the biggest controversy by far was over the debates. The league has sponsored presidential debates since 1976. Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats were happy with the way the debates had been run and before the 1988 campaign formed the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Presidential Debates to serve as a rival sponsor. The league sponsored two debates during the primary season, but two more fell through when candidates backed out. The campaigns agreed to let the league sponsor one of two presidential debates in the fall, but <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> angrily withdrew the organization's sponsorship 11 days before the event, saying the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigns were trying to stifle spontaneity The dispute turned bitter. The league said it would turn over the debate site, the Shrine Auditorium in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, to the new sponsors for $ 90,000 _ twice the amount it had put down. Then, the party commission charged the league had n't even put down a deposit on the building until it announced plans to withdraw. The commission said that amounted to holding the auditorium `` hostage.'' The new sponsors found a new _ and rent-free _ site. `` A lot of the people on both the Republican and Democrat sides who had to work with the league in past debates found them very, very difficult to work with,'' <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said. `` The league spent all its time hustling money and using it for their fundraising; it almost became, the only thing the league existed for any more was to hold the debates,'' <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> charged. League officials say they asked for the extra money to cover contracts for sets and lighting, and said it paid more to withdraw from the debates than it would have to let them proceed. The debate issue hangs over the league still, as it looks to what <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> sees as a bright future. It will continue to sponsor local debates in 1990, and <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> says the league will propose presidential debates in 1992. `` Until then,'' she says, `` we will be working to ensure that the American public is never again force-fed a campaign as mediocre and as patronizing as this one.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's another question of whether the feds should tell the states what to do and, if so, who should foot the bill? This time the debate is about the quality of day care for children, and when kids are involved emotions run high. More than two dozen child-care bills are now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> while President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has some ideas of his own.

 A baby sitter recently saved the lives of eight young children by tossing them from the window of her burning apartment to the arms of rescuers three stories below. There was heroism in the tale, but it also raised some questions. Should one person have been looking after eight children ranging in age from 5 months to 3 years? Were the children getting the individual attention considered vital to healthy child development? Even more basic, was the situation safe? And who's to blame for day care that is abusive, hazardous, emotionally damaging or intellectually barren? Day care for children traditionally has been regulated by the individual states. Now <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is debating whether to enact minimum federal standards and force states to toe the line. No fewer than two dozen child-care bills are pending on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, with advocates of federal regulation insisting that some states simply are not doing a proper job. The controversy over federal encroachment on the turf of the states was a major factor holding up child-care legislation last year and the fireworks promise to be equally as lively this year. Are states doing the job? <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, who is leading a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> push for federal incentives instead of requirements, says, `` The record reflects a significant effort in most states to improve child-care standards.'' But officials of the Children's Defense Fund maintain there are wide discrepancies in the standards from state to state. In some states, for example, a single adult can not care for more than three infants. But in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, a new mandatory licensing system theoretically permits one person to care for 12 infants. `` The states that are generally moving forward are the ones that were n't in such bad shape to begin with,'' says <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Blank </PERSON>, day care director for the <ORGANIZATION> CDF </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we still have a situation where in many states licensing standards do n't give children the protection they need to grow up safe _ much less give them a good developmental experience. `` The bottom line is that a few states have gone backwards. In some states, what they call progress makes you a little uncomfortable.'' Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is pushing for a tax break for low-income families with young children, on the premise that it gives parents a choice. One parent can decide to stay home or the family can use the money for the child care of their choice. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan presumes that parents do n't want or need federal intrusion in the day care field. Any federal requirements would decrease the supply of care and infringe on parental choice, backers of the plan contend. But some parents have told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> they always assumed the government regulated child care until tragedy struck their family. And experts contend that most parents are n't qualified to judge day care _ and why should they have to? `` We do n't ask restaurant patrons to inspect the kitchen for violations,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, a child-care consultant who teaches pediatrics at <ORGANIZATION> Hahneman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. There is little disagreement among experts over ideal day care conditions for children. Some are physical, such as requiring staffers to frequently wash their hands to prevent the spread of infectious disease, providing immunizations, fire extinguishers and enough adults on hand to get infants and young toddlers to safety in an emergency. Then there is quality _ `` warm, positive, individual, one-to-one interactions between adults and children,'' as described by Dr. <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Bredekamp </PERSON>, director of professional development at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>. Such interactions have a long-term effect on language, self-esteem, social development and intellectual competence, she says. Her group has identified three factors that most influence the quality of day care interactions: group size, the staff-to-child ratio, and staff training. The federal government operates dozens of day care centers for its employees across the country and overseas, and many agencies without centers are now making on-sight child care a priority. The Learning Center at the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meets or betters nearly all standards recommended by professional groups and is serving as a model for that movement. Director <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> says other centers send their teachers to observe the staff and organizers come to find out how to set up centers at their agencies. `` We get people coming to look at us all the time,'' she said. Bredekamp of the <ORGANIZATION> NAEYC </ORGANIZATION> says proper training might have averted the recent death of a 9-month-old infant whose nanny banged her head against the wall because she would not stop crying. `` We must face the very real possibility that the nanny did not know any better,'' she says. Training not only can prevent child abuse but also enables care-givers to help children grow and learn, she says. `` Our goal is not that children just survive child care. We want and need for them to thrive in child care.'' To that end, she says, 20 preschoolers and two adults is far superior to 40 kids and four adults in terms of noise level, psychological space and opportunities for individual interactions with adults and other children. And, she says, one adult for every three or four infants is critical if babies are to be adequately held, rocked, comforted and protected from physical harm. Even states with relatively stringent regulations often fall short of standards recommended by professionals. Only 15 states meet <ORGANIZATION> NAEYC </ORGANIZATION> guidelines for infant ratios and group size. Only five meet the guidelines for toddlers and 10 for preschoolers. Nearly half do n't require any training or experience of day care teachers. On the health and safety front, about half the states do n't have specific day care center hand-washing requirements, according to a forthcoming study by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The federally funded study, meant to be a comparative report card for states, also has found that only 6 percent require that center children be immunized for meningitis. And only 18 percent require energy absorbing surfaces below climbing equipment, although one-half to two-thirds of all injuries occur on playgrounds.

 Many state legislatures have agreed to some minimum standards, but have balked at more stringent regulations urged by some agencies. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, for example, the state has just instituted a mandatory licensing system _ its first. But while the new law requires fire and health inspections and criminal history checks, it does n't require any education or training of staff members The staff-child ratio is 1 to 12, regardless of the ages of the children. Staffers watching no more than six kids are not regulated at all. `` The law is less strict than our regulations were under the previous law,'' says <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, child care licensing coordinator for the state. `` But that was voluntary. There was n't any penalty for being unlicensed. Is that progress? `` We lost a lot in the area of quality,'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> replies. `` But we got a mandatory law after eight or nine attempts. I guess it's progress.'' In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, regulations for the state's 14,000-plus family day care homes are about to be revised. Under the current system, the only qualification for care-givers is that they be 18 years old. And they can watch up to 12 children, depending on their ages. One mix allows one adult to care for four infants and two toddlers. Another permits six young children and six school-age siblings. While <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> requires centers to be licensed, its much weaker registration system for day care homes was highlighted by toddler <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>'s well-publicized tumble into an abandoned well shaft. With six children in her care, the baby sitter thought she did n't need to register with the state. She was wrong. But even if she had registered, the state would have done no more than run checks for a criminal record or reports of child abuse. No one would have visited the house and discovered the well shaft in the yard. `` It's providing a false sense of security to parents,'' says <PERSON> Cris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Dukler </PERSON>, the state's assistant commissioner for licensing. <PERSON> Ros-Dukler </PERSON> says she has unsuccessfully sought money to put teeth in the registration process. An attempt two years ago to limit family day care homes to six children `` got nowhere,'' she says. Hopes for change at this point turn on raising the minimum care-giver age to 21 and requiring training both before and after becoming a provider. At the other end of the spectrum, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> upgraded family day care in 1985 and just completed an overhaul of center regulations. The ratio now is one staffer to four infants. Health and safety requirements are much more stringent. Care-givers now must participate in 15 hours of training a year and expose children to a range of daily activities appropriate to their age. What does <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> have that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> does n't? A healthier economy, for one thing, and a less-hostile attitude toward regulation. `` You really have to determine what is the community standard that is going to be acceptable,'' says <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s director of licensing services <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Wheelock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and author of the `` The National State of Child-Care Regulation,'' does n't agree that federal standards are the answer. `` I'm amenable to one federal standard: infant care,'' she says. `` I'm convinced that a one to seven infant ratio can have extremely harmful effects.'' The dangers, she says, include borderline retardation from lack of stimulation; increased spread of infectious disease, and the sheer physical impossibility of exiting a building quickly with seven infants. The federal government should otherwise stay out of the mandate business unless they are willing to fork over $ 20 billion to $ 30 billion to help parents and states pay for the upgraded care, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> says. The nation's governors agree. They are proposing the development of national model standards on everything from nutrition and safety to staff size, training and parental involvement, and seeking federal financial incentives for states to upgrade their systems. `` If the states have incentive grants and after a few years you can show me people still doing things that are certifiably bad for kids, then I personally will be glad to take another look at this federal standards issue,'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> says. Model standards have failed to influence states in the past, and hard-liners hold little hope of progress _ even with a federal carrot. `` In some states there is such strong opposition to making improvements that money incentives will not work,'' says <PERSON> Blank </PERSON>, the Children's Defense Fund day care director. <PERSON> Blank </PERSON> and her allies note that the states must meet a variety of conditions to get federal money for <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION>, school lunches, nursing homes, highways and anti-pollution projects. So why not day care? `` Taxpayers do not want their tax dollars used to place babies and children in dangerous situations,'' says <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Strom </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> says mandatory child-care standards would be like mandatory elementary school standards. `` We have smaller class requirements now in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>,'' he says. `` It's very expensive, it's very controversial and it's very good for at-risk kids. I'm glad we did it, but I would n't recommend it as a national standard. The debate at the <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> household, half a continent away from the talk on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, has a familiar ring. For while <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> has been designated lead governor in the <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION> bid to discourage mandated national standards, his wife <PERSON> Hillary </PERSON> is chairman of the Children's Defense Fund _ the fiercest standards champion of all. `` If it was just the two of us, I think we could work it out,'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said with a laugh. `` But it's not.''

<HEAD>``Drifting Away'' From Reagan</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 The critics call it drift, and maybe they're right But there certainly is a prevailing current in the early course of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration _ and it leads away from some of the policies and positions bequeathed by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made those moves carefully and quietly, item by item. He is putting his imprint on major programs, supplanting and in some cases undoing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policies, transformations that have been taking place with scant notice and only a few complaints from conservatives. That's just fine with the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his lieutenants need no trouble on the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> right, where the president never was a favorite. Most of the criticism has been coming from other directions, much of it from Democrats. Still, there are some ripples on the right. When Republican National Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> spoke at the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> the other night, one man complained that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has moved away from some favored conservative positions since the election. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a conservative,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> replied. He said on two paramount issues, opposition to new taxes and a hard line against communism, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is solid and absolute. `` He remains hard core on both of those,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denies that his administration is adrift. Challenging those who complain about the pace of administration action, he said in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> last month: `` In this kind of work, more is going on than meets the eye _ or makes the headlines. The proof will come when we look back from the year 2000.'' He's also countered by joking about the criticism. `` People say I'm indecisive,'' he said last week. Presidential pause. `` I do n't know about that. `` Some started saying that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> did n't have an agenda,'' said Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` We have an agenda. It's just that when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left, he took it with him. Jokes aside, if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came back, he may not recognize some of that agenda. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who served both men, says the Reagan-to-Bush revisions are in approach, not in goals. He says they differ at the margin, not on the basics. From the outset, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he envisioned no radical change in course from the administration he served as vice president. Nevertheless, some <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> positions have been retired since he did. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s agreement with the Democrats on aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels is a prime example. The administration has agreed to seek only non-military aid, only through next February and subject to congressional committee veto. Since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has rejected military aid, the net result is similar to what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> got. But administration policy now is to seek diplomatic answers in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, rather than look to military ones. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who negotiated the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged the failure of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policy. `` We all have to admit that the policy failed to some extent because we were not united,'' he said. `` We had an executive branch going in one direction and a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> going in the other.'' On the domestic agenda, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has embraced a compromise version of a bill _ which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pocket vetoed _ to protect federal employees who blow the whistle on waste, abuse and mismanagement. The compromise might have satisfied <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>; he never said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposed any increase in the $ 3.35 hourly minimum wage. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has endorsed an increase, tied to a lower-than-minimum training wage for new workers. Congressional Democrats want a higher minimum and a more restricted training wage. That's still in dispute and the administration has talked of a veto unless there is a satisfactory compromise. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has moved away from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> position on the question of gun controls, which also was his own _ a flat no. The administration on Wednesday widened its import ban on foreign-made assault rifles, and an official said it is considering a proposal that gun buyers register such weapons. Even those modest moves drew the standard protests from the gun lobby, despite the growing sense of crisis over drug-related violence in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities and the murder of five children in a <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, schoolyard. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> told his conservative audience that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remains opposed to gun control despite the moves against assault rifles, on which he said there is growing public sentiment in favor of limits. `` If the conservative position is pro-assault rifle, you'd better get out and start moving around'' to hear the public outcry, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Heartbeat of New Orleans</HEAD>
<UNK>By LYNNE BERNSTEIN ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 They're called the `` heartbeat of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>.'' And in music circles, the <LOCATION> Neville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brothers </LOCATION> are known as `` musician's musicians.'' For over 30 years, the <LOCATION> Neville </LOCATION> name has been synonymous with all the traditions of the Crescent city. Their sound is culled from a gumbo of styles _ jazz, <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, African, Cajun, rock, funk _ resulting in music as distinctive as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> itself. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Neville </PERSON>, who plays saxophone, calls it <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> rhythm and blues. The brothers _ Art, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> _ worked individually for more than two decades before they finally merged their diverse talents in 1977. After several albums and a two-year interlude, the band has just released their new album, `` Yellow Moon.'' The collection, including eight original songs, is perhaps their most political and personal album, one in which they express their concern for social issues. The album's first single, `` Sister Rosa,'' is a tribute to <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, who became one of the catalysts for the civil rights movement in 1955 when she refused to give up her seat for a white person on a segregated bus in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. The rap-reggae number, written and performed by percussionist <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON>, reflects the album's overall theme: to educate people by increasing their awareness. `` If you do n't learn from history, it tends to repeat itself because it can definitely happen again,'' said Art, the keyboardist. `` Look at the neo-nazis and Skinheads,'' added <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON>, wearing a `` Stop Apartheid'' button. `` We want to give youth a chance to look at each other on their own terms, rather than how it was in the last generation who had a certain amount of fear and hatred pumped into them before they got a chance to look at people and decide for themselves. `` We want to convey to youth that they do n't have to be superhuman or smart to make a change for the better in the world.'' `` My Blood,'' another song by <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON>, speaks about the roots of oppression, with particular mention of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, Haitians and native Americans. There's also a remake of <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>'s `` A Change Is Gon na Come,'' and two <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> covers, `` The Ballad of <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'' and `` With God on Our Side.'' Although <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> trade off as lead vocalists on most of the album, Art gets the chance to belt out `` Fire and Brimstone'' with the same enthusiasm he seems to have for life in general. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> is heard prominently on the instrumental `` Healing Chant.'' There is a tenuous and harmonious thread to `` Yellow Moon,'' partly due to producer <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanois </PERSON>' -LRB- <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, U2 -RRB- recording style. He used a New Orleans apartment instead of a studio. `` His method of recording is to build the studio around the artist, rather than force the artist to conform to some existing environment,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said. `` The nickname for the studio became ` the swamp,''' <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> said with a laugh. `` A whole atmosphere was created which you are able to hear on the record.'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Demme </PERSON> -LRB- `` Something Wild,'' `` Married to the Mob'' -RRB- directed the video for `` Sister Rosa.'' The filmmaker shares the musicians' interest in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. After working with artists there and hearing <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> sing `` My Blood,'' <PERSON> Demme </PERSON> wanted American artists to go to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> to perform. `` But he did n't want it to be like a <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON>, referring to the so-called integrated music venue in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` He wanted people with more similar roots and backgrounds.'' The brothers and <PERSON> Demme </PERSON> are working on a video with the Haitian band <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parent </ORGANIZATION>. The brothers' musical roots go back to the'50s. Art was part of the Hawkettes in 1954 when they recorded the legendary <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> anthem, `` Mardi Gras Mambo.'' In the 1970s, he helped form the Meters, a funk group with great impact on fellow musicians and such new bands as The Police. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> was busy touring with <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> `` Blue'' Bland and B.B. King. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> had a Top 10 hit in 1967 with `` Tell It Like It Is.'' <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> was involved in his own band before he joined Art with the Meters in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, who were touring with the Rolling Stones. When <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> joined the Meters to record `` The Wild Tchoupitoulas'' album, it was the first time in years the brothers had all played together. `` It happened so easily and beautifully, and we were so proud of the finished product,'' said <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON>. So they decided to form the <ORGANIZATION> Neville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>. Although their popularity stems from their hometown of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, they initially did n't have a large following as a group. `` We used to play <ORGANIZATION> Tipitina </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. You could blow it up and get no one but the <ORGANIZATION> Neville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>,'' Art recalled. `` But we're just enjoying it as it happens.'' <PERSON> Tipitina </PERSON>'s is a popular New Orleans music hall, and was featured in the film `` The Big Easy'' along with The <ORGANIZATION> Neville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> music. After the release of their first album, `` The <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON>,'' the group took off. Their 1981 `` Fiyo on the Bayou'' was a critical and commercial success. Rolling Stones guitarist <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> called it the best album of that year. But their 1987 `` Uptown'' did n't quite make it. Even devoted fans felt it was an attempt at mass appeal. `` Yellow Moon'' should dispel any doubts of the brothers' integrity. A Cinemax special in May will include such guests as <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Raitt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Allman </PERSON>, Buckwheat Zydeco, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiatt </PERSON> and TV journalist <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> who will perform `` Sixty Minute Man'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> is one of many fans who has danced with wild abandon at a <ORGANIZATION> Neville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> concert. `` Our music is definitely dance music. That's the way to respond to it,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>. `` The same energy we put out is recycled through the audience. In a place with no dance floor, there's less energy coming back from the audience.''

 The tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> was freed Wednesday from the reef that ripped its hull and spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude oil, and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s governor asked the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to take over the cleanup from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. Elsewhere, the captain of the Exxon Valdez surrendered to police and was ordered held on $ 1 million bond. Cleanup crews continued to skim mayonnaise-thick oil from Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, but progress was slow and the oil had spread over an area larger than <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. The animal death toll rose and salmon hatcheries remained endangered. In <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said he asked <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rear </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to take over the much-maligned and slowly progressing cleanup effort from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> indicated he would, although he has not formally approved the request. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> should be better able to handle coordination and management of the cleanup than <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, which he said was too bureaucratic. `` Maybe that's been the problem all along. You need a military system to get things done,'' the governor said. `` We appreciate the efforts of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> _ we think they were done in good faith. But we think there has to be a much more disciplined management structure,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said at a Capitol news conference. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier had sent a team of high-level officials to <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> and determined that federal management of the cleanup was n't necessary. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> management is different from the plan <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected. Although <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said he did n't want to be `` extremely critical'' of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, a letter sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> by a state environmental official said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had been unresponsive. `` Exxon has failed to provide ... the information necessary to make sound planning recommendations regarding the cleanup of oil and the protection of resources,'' wrote <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, chief of the state Oil and Hazardous Substance Spill Response Section. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON> said the company disagreed with charges it was n't handling the cleanup properly and thought <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was the best organization to manage the effort. `` We gathered all the resources and organized the cleanup. We think the most effective and efficient way to carry out this project is -LRB- for Exxon -RRB- to continue,'' <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON> said. Fired tanker captain <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, surrendered to police on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and a judge set bail at $ 1 million bond or $ 500,000 in cash, up from a prosecutor's recommendation of $ 25,000. He had been sought since Saturday on a fugitive warrant on misdemeanor charges of operating the tanker while drunk. `` These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been equaled, at least in this country,'' Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohl </PERSON> said as <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was arraigned. `` He's got to think about that. We have a manmade destruction that has not been equaled, probably, since <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>.'' Salvage crews pumped compressed air into the $ 125 million ship and floated it off <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>, 25 miles from the port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. From there, it began a 30-mile journey under the control of six tugs to a remote cove off Naked Island for temporary repairs, picking its way through scattered icebergs. `` No pollution was immediately visible. There's a real good possibility -LRB- oil -RRB- sheen will show up, but they're ready for it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Meidt </PERSON> said. The ship was refloated at 10:35 a.m., hours before the tide reached its peak Wednesday. `` It was not just a stroke of good luck,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorski </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s salvage coordinator. `` It took a lot of hard work.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said the company has talked with dry docks in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> about accepting the vessel after the temporary repairs are made First choice is a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, dry dock, <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said, but <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> officials have raised concerns about accepting the ship. <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said the ship wo n't trail any pollution while it is towed. Oil has floated over 2,600 square miles, soiled 800 miles of beach and killed thousands of animals, including at least 30 sea otters, officials said. `` Dozens of otters are dying before rescuers can get to them,'' said fish and game spokesman <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON>. Favorable weather, however, has kept it offshore from a national park and additional coastline outside Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Flow through the Alaskan pipeline returned to its normal daily flow of 2.1 million barrels Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said. Oil flow from the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slope </ORGANIZATION> had been cut by 60 percent because the spill restricted tanker traffic in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> harbor, but traffic has increased. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> accused the federal government of covering up the possibility of a major spill and the ineffectiveness of cleanup technology. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrats also asked President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to cancel oil leasing off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast pending a review of the program. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> turned himself in with three attorneys in <LOCATION> Hauppauge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and was arraigned. His lawyer said he had not decided whether to waive extradition proceedings and return to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to face the charges. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> is charged with operating a ship while under the influence of alcohol, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. The charges carry a combined maximum penalty of 2 \ years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> say they also are investigating whether <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> could be charged with felony violations of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits negligent discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> a week ago after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said tests taken about nine hours after the disaster showed he was drunk. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> had been arrested twice for drunken driving and had his license suspended three times. His mother has told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that her son had undergone rehabilitation and that <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> was aware of his drinking problem. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it has changed its policy because of the spill and now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited, four hours before sailing. One hundred claims have been filed with the company for damages, including 40 on Tuesday alone. The claims have come mostly from fishermen. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has settled only two so far. At least 14 lawsuits have been filed.

<HEAD>Analysts: Lorenzo Profits Likely From Any Eastern Sale</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Any sale of strike-crippled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> could eventually hurt the airline and sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its chairman, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, may reap millions, analysts say. Some analysts believe a sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets and other advantages <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has gained during <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s three years of ownership of the airline would produce a sizable profit despite <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s heavy losses and long list of creditors. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> bought Eastern in 1986 for $ 600 million. `` Our position is that he'll come out of the deal all right as far as Eastern is concerned, but what we are concerned about in the long term is these airlines' continuing position in the industry,'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said Wednesday. `` I still think there was a potential -LRB- merger -RRB- there between <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern that could have made a viable carrier in the'90s. But I think either one of these carriers by themselves may have a hard row to hoe in the future,'' <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said. An investor group headed by former baseball commisoner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> reportedly was in the fdnesday of negotiations to buy Eastern from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, but the deal hit a snag. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> agreed last week to sell <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s prized <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle operation to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 355 million. Analysts said that since Eastern is in bankruptcy reorganizd has creditors waiting to collect millions, it's still hard to gauge just how much <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> would gain from ae. Any Eastern sale would hto be approved by the airline's unsecured creditors committee, which includes rntatives of the Eastern unions, and by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> But <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> estimates that Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> could see an overall profit of more than $ 100 million from its three-year ownership, based on expected proceeds from the sale of Eastern and from revenues received during its ownership. That gain would be on top of the increased value of <ORGANIZATION> Ehat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> acquired from the airline, such as the former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> computerized reservation sys merged with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s to form System One. The system is used by many travel agencies. `` The immediate impact will be that Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> will get someh out of it, and I fully expect that, whatever fale takes, that will be the case,'' said <PERSON> Robertn </PERSON> airline analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in Ch The amount of profit for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> will depend partly on whether a buyout includes assumptern's debts, <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said. It also was uncether <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> would use any such profit to strengthen <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which lost $ 258.1 million in 1987 and $ 315.5 million in 1988. Continentave Messing declined to comment Wednesday on thtial effects of an Eastern sale. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> did not return telephone calls seeking comment. Some experts said that even if an Eastern sale raised money to help pay off <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> debt, it might not go too far in helping the company's remaining operations. `` Continental is pretty debt-ridden themselves,'' said <PERSON> Severin </PERSON> <PERSON> Borenstein </PERSON>, an airst and economist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>. `` It does n't look like they're going to start reporting in the soon, and unless they eventually turn things around they may nlong for this world.'' <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> also cast doubts on <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s future. `` Just to keep up with wha in companies like <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> or <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, where they have $ 10 -LRB- billion -RRB- to $ 20 billion worth of equipt on order, is going to be extremely difficult,'' <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said. `` With Eastern gone maybe they will concentrate on pouring capital into <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` But I do n't have much confidence in the surviving management of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Air that they will do the right thing to make <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> a strong competitor in the future.''

<TEXT>
 Two major oil companies have limited gasoline deliveries to wholesale distributors in Western states in what one spokesman called the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gas rationing since the Arab oil embargo of the early 1970s. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that the rationing was to prevent the hoarding of gasoline in the wake of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview that is was the first gasoline rationing he could recall since the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to put a cap on its deliveries to wholesalers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> was a result of excessive buying by those distributors in the last week. `` Some of our Western regional -LRB- wholesalers -RRB- began buying excessive amounts of gasoline last week, and this -LRB- program -RRB- is strictly in response to that,'' said <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, adding he did n't have specific purchase details immediately available. He denied <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s `` supply management program'' was put into effect because of shortages in crude supplies. He said most of the crude for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> refineries, located at <LOCATION> Anacortes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, comes from sources other than <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The decision to limit sales to 90 percent of the gasoline the wholesalers purchased in April 1988 went into effect Monday and will remain until <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> decides it's no longer necessary, he said. He said he did not know why <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> chose 90 percent as its figure. The wholesalers rushed to purchase gasoline after the tanker Exxon Valdez slammed into rocks in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> on March 24, dumping more than 10 million gallons of crude in what became the nation's worst oil spill. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> began its rationing just three days after the accident in anticipation of stepped-up gasoline purchases, said company spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Libbey </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. On March 27, <PERSON> Chervon </PERSON> began to limit deliveries to 100 percent of contract agreements to make sure there'd be enough gasoline to go around, <PERSON> Libbey </PERSON> said. The cost of gasoline in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area has climbed about 8 cents a gallon in the last three weeks, the biggest hikes having occurred since the spill. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> would not comment on whether the 90 percent allotments helped to increase wholesale and gasoline-pump prices. But <PERSON> Libbey </PERSON> said it was clear that the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> spill translated into a 4-cent to 7-cent hike in <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s price per gallon to retailers. Major West oast refineries rely heavily on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil to masoline and other products. The pipeline from Alah Slope to <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> usually carries 2 million barrels of crude a day, but that was reduced to 800,000 barrels a day after the spill limited tanker loadings at the port. Cclaimed to have no problem with crude supplies to its major <LOCATION> Wesst </LOCATION> refineries, in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> areas. ` <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> has n't had to limit refinery activity at all,'' <PERSON> Libbey </PERSON>. `` I gather from what I hear that the independents -LRB- smaller oil companies -RRB- are squeezed more tightly than we a they do n't have the resources we have and room to maneuver.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> said it would not be able to provide infomation on whether it has a similar gasoline dist effect until sometime today, and information from other major il companies was n't immediately available. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s deliveries to retail gasoline stations served directly are not affected by the cap because those stations ca n't keep much gasoline in storage, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said He did not know how much of <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s gasoline in Western states goes as opposed to retailers. Once operations are returned to normal in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, gasoline prices will start dropping, but not by much, he said. Most of the increases consumers have seen since the New Year are the result of a decision last fall by the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations to limit production. And, he added, the popular summer driving season is approaching, meaning demand will stay high and keep prices up.

 The stock of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 3.50 to a record-high $ 87.25 a share after oil mogul <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said his $ 2.62 billion proposal to buy the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> would not require selling the carrier's main assets. `` We do not intend to ` bust up' the company, and our planned financing will not necessitate the sale of any of the company's strategic assets,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said in a letter he sent to <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors Tuesday and released to the media Wednesday More than 2.5 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock changed hands Wednesday. The Los Angeles-based billionaire, whose holdings include real estate and entertainment properties, owns about 3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s 29.1 million shares and offered to pay $ 90 a share for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock in a letter last week to company directors `` With the equity we are prepared to commit and the anticipated structure of the balance of the financing, the company's projected cash flow is adequate to service the debt involved,'' the second letter said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said in the letter that his group is `` prepared to increase the price of our offer in the context of a negotiated transaction.'' A spokesman for the nation's fourth-largest air carrier, based in suburban <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, confirmed receipt of the letter, but said the company would not comment. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> has said the directors will review the offer, but he has not said when. The airline has said it intends to remain independent. State officials have rallied behind the carrier, introducing legislation intended to thwart a hostile takeover.

They said that might result in layoffs and in Northwest moving its service hub from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 143, said he remains `` suspicious'' of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' offer because <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has not provided specifics about how he would finance it. `` I believe he has a history of buying and selling companies,'' said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, who heads the union representing two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 35,000 employees. `` He has ownership for a period of time and then he sells it off.'' <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON>, a financial analyst for Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the increase in <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price Wednesday suggests confidence on the part of investors that a higher bid is on its way. `` It could come from <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION>, it could come from <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, it could come from somewhere else,'' <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> said. Before <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> made his offer, the company disclosed a separate group of investors was interested in buying <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>. The identity of that group, which said it owns 4.9 percent of the stock, has not been disclosed. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> repeated in his letter an earlier statement that he intends to expand the airline's domestic and international routes and keep the headquarters in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. He also said his plans call for `` no employee layoffs, work-force reductions or alterations in seniority schedules.'' The letter said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> management would be retained, but also said, `` we intend to effect only those management changes required to improve <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s performance.'' Analysts have said a takeover could impair <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet modernization plans because <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> would have to sell assets and cuts operating costs to service takeover debt. But <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said in his letter that the acquisition plan `` in no way calls for the reduction of the company's present capital investment program.'' Northwest has discussed profit-sharing and stock ownership plans with its unions for more than a year. Analysts have said an employee stock ownership plan could help the carrier defend itself against a takeover by putting more stock in friendly hands.

<HEAD>Alaska's Marriage With Oil Industry: On The Rocks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> hit the rocks, so did <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s marriage of convenience with the oil industry. But despite the environmental and economic damage wrought by the nation's worst oil spill, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> is unlikely to divorce itself from an industry whose taxes fund 85 percent of state services. Elected officials and political observers say the relationship instead will be marked by greater mistrust and skepticism, and future oil development in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> may be curtailed. `` I guarantee <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> wo n't have the same trust in the industry that it had in the past,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We're going to take the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> attitude: Show me.'' The sentiment expressed by <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a pro-development <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and longtime industry supporter, has been heard throughout the state Capitol since the Good Friday spill. `` The spill is going to change the political chemistry in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. `` It's probably too early to assess what changes will take place. However, it is clear that people are not likely to trust statements that the industry makes on their face for a long time to come.'' Legislators say the industry, which for years assured Alaskans it could handle a massive oil spill quickly, has lost its credibility. `` The full-faith-and-credit type of attitude toward their operation is going to change,'' warned Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Grussendorf </PERSON>. After construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline in the mid-1970s, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> began cashing in on its abundant petroleum reservoirs, rushing to bring its villages many of the modern conveniences taken for granted in the Lower 48. Oil brought telephone service to even <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s most remote areas, dozens of schools and community buildings, a state television network, water and sewer systems, airports and roads. Most of all, it brought money. Lots of money. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> is the only state that annually pays its residents just for living there. Last year, each Alaskan got a `` dividend'' of $ 827 from interest earned by the state Permanent Fund, a $ 10 billion savings account derived from oil money. For a family of four, that meant $ 3,308. The flood of oil money also allowed the state to repeal its income tax in 1980. There's no state sales tax. `` Most people in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> are aware that the oil industry brings benefits and detriments,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. `` We've enjoyed the benefits over the years. Now we're seeing the detriments.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Glude </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lobby </ORGANIZATION>, said he was surprised how widespread the sense of betrayal has become. `` We do n't like to make the goose that lays the golden egg uncomfortable. Suddenly the industry has laid a black egg and we're not too enchanted with the goose,'' <PERSON> Glude </PERSON> said `` I think a lot of people are ready to declare their independence from Big Oil. We're seeing a lot of recognition that the state is entirely too dependent on the oil industry for its revenue and economic base.'' Many observers, however, doubt <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s dependence on its natural resources will end as long as there's vast amounts of oil, minerals and timber to be sold in the nation's largest state. `` Resource development is so intimately linked with our history and our future,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulmer </PERSON>, a Democrat. `` We are a resource-rich state and our resources are what produce jobs, what produce income and sufficient revenue to support services Alaskans have come to expect.'' <PERSON> Ulmer </PERSON> and other legislators predict that as a result of the spill the state will toughen its environmental laws, provide more money to monitor compliance with those laws, and demand more proof of environmental safeguards. Lawmakers already have jumped on the new anti-oil bandwagon. Legislation introduced Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would tax oil companies to pay for protection of state land against spills. And what appeared to be a losing campaign by <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> to increase the state's oil-production tax has new life. The fallout from the Valdez spill also may dampen development overall in what has always been a pro-development state, one that bills itself as `` The Last Frontier.'' `` I think the development spirit in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> is going to be much more cautious than before the oil spill,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. State officials still largely favor new oil exploration and development, but the spill provides new ammunition to environmentalists. An end to oil drilling eventually would dry up the estimated $ 4 million of oil revenues that flow into the state treasury daily. Democrat <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> and the state's all-Republican congressional delegation have been lobbying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to open a portion of the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration. In the wake of the spill, the chances of gaining congressional approval appear slim. `` I do n't think it will make it impossible to get an ANWR bill through the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. `` I just think it will be extraordinarily difficult.''

<HEAD>Taxpayers Missing Key Points of 1986 Tax Law, IRS Says</HEAD>

 A new effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to spot errors and tax-avoidance schemes without a formal audit has turned up considerable evidence of apparent non-compliance with several provisions in the new tax law. In some cases, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> says, taxpayers are ignoring the limitation on deducting miscellaneous itemized expenses, such as union dues. Others are overlooking new restrictions on deducting personal and investment interest. Some are circumventing complicated requirements on the treatment of losses from rentals and passive investment activities. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is concentrating on those four issues because they underwent significant change in the 1986 tax overhaul, show up on numerous returns and have the potential for yielding substantial amounts of money for the government, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is looking at 1987 and 1988 tax returns to determine how much revenue is being lost and how forms and instructions could be changed to eliminate confusion and opportunity for cheating. Rather than waiting for barely 1 percent of returns to make their way through the formal audit procedure _ which can be as long as two years after returns are processed _ the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has set up teams in each of the 10 regional service centers to make spot checks as soon as returns are filed. A big goal in the effort is to not only correct the returns that are checked but also to make the public aware of what mistakes are being made with regularity and how to avoid them. `` When we see things on the return that are not allowable, we want first to get that information to taxpayers through public-affairs channels ... during the filing season,'' said <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, who directs <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> research on audit planning. `` We want to fix as many of these things as we can without doing audits on people,'' he said. `` If we can do these as part of -LRB- returns -RRB- processing, that's what we want to do.'' The agency is studying several thousands of returns for 1987, the first year that most of the major tax changes went into effect. Those returns were filed in 1988. About 150,000 1988 returns, which are due by April 17, are being checked. As much as anything else, the new program is an attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to see how people are reacting to the 1986 law, which, by some calculations, represented the biggest change in the federal income tax since it was enacted in 1913. `` There were so many changes, designed to close loopholes and reduce deductions,'' explained <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nerdlinger </PERSON>. `` We need to know how people are taking it. Are the changes misunderstood? Are people aware they have lost some deductions but are still intent on taking them?'' One of the big changes affects millions of itemizers who were accustomed to fully deducting union dues, business publications and similar miscellaneous expenses. Under the new law, only the portion of such expenses -LRB- with a few exceptions -RRB- that exceeds 2 percent of adjusted gross income may be deducted. The spot check of 1987 returns found many taxpayers ignored the 2 percent floor. Others deducted expenses that did not qualify, such as personal attorney fees. Another major change limited to 65 percent the portion of personal interest -LRB- such as on credit cards and education loans -RRB- that could be deducted for 1987. Similar restrictions were imposed on investment interest. Spot checks indicated many taxpayers had circumvented those restrictions by deducting the interest as a business expense on Schedule C. Similarly, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said, some filers have tried to dodge limitations on deducting passive losses and rental losses by writing them off as business losses on Schedule C. On returns filed this year, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has found many taxpayers still trying to avoid the limitation on deducting personal interest. Other areas of non-compliance on current returns, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said, include claiming too much depreciation for automobiles used in business, and attempting to avoid the 80 percent limit on deducting business-related meals and entertainment.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is allying itself with the automobile industry and opposing congressional efforts to set deadlines for the government to issue new motor vehicle safety requirements. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Felrice </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for rulemaking, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> the agency opposes legislation that would give it a one-year deadline to issue the new safety requirements. `` The provisions in the new bill requiring us to initiate or complete these actions within prescriptive time frames are overly restrictive,'' said <PERSON> Felrice </PERSON>, who said his testimony had been approved by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. He said work on safety regulations `` does n't lend itself to easy solutions.'' Officials from the nation's three major automakers _ <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ also voiced opposition to a deadline for new rules. `` I'd hate to see us get into a mode where time frames dictate the incorporation of technology,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Munson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s automotive safety director, told the panel. The agency's opposition to the proposals came as a disappointment to lawmakers of both parties on the subcommittee and to consumer activists in the room, who said they had hoped the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would adopt a more sympathetic approach to motor vehicle safety proposals. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> is the comic book example of a federal regulatory agency that does nothing,'' said an angry Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo. Subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, D-Nev., complained that the agency's rule-making process `` has a longer gestation period than anything known in the laws of nature. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> and several other senators have introduced a bill ordering the safety administration to require automakers to strengthen vehicles to better withstand side impact crashes, in which nearly one-third of all deaths of auto occupants occur. The agency would also have to require head restraints, mounted rear brake lights and other safety features for pickup trucks and minivans, a fast-growing market. In addition, the agency would have to require manufacturers to produce bumpers that can prevent major damage to a car traveling at 5 mph. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had opposed regulations in all those areas. In 1982, the safety administration rolled back the bumper standard from 5 mph to 2.5 mph. The safety administration already has work under way dealing with side impact crashes for cars and head restraints for light trucks, <PERSON> Felrice </PERSON> said. He also opposed two new requirements in the bill: that minivans and pickup trucks be built to better prevent rollovers, and that car seats used by young children be improved. He said the agency is already studying both problems. `` The bill seems to have us begin rule-making before we complete the research,'' he said. The safety administration, established in 1966 to set vehicle safety standards and investigate defects, came under frequent criticism during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years by lawmakers who accused the agency of stifling safety initiatives. <PERSON> Felrice </PERSON>, who is not a political appointee, testified because the agency has no administrator. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> White House has said it will nominate <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> general who was defeated in a bid for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> last fall, for the job.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> it will install driver-side air bags as standard equipment on 13 models of its 1990 passenger cars and offer the devices as options on two other models. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s director of automotive safety engineering, told members of a subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plans to equip about 500,000' 90-model cars with air bags The federal government required that automakers equip 10 percent of their 1987-model cars with some kind of passive restraint, either automatic seat belts or air bags. That requirement rose to 40 percent with the 1989 model year and will reach 100 percent with 1990-model cars. Driver-side air bags will be standard equipment on the 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reatta </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON> <PERSON> Allante </PERSON>, DeVille, <LOCATION> Eldorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fleetwood </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chevrolet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Camaro </LOCATION> and Corvette; Geo Storm and <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> convertible; Oldsmobile Toronado; and <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firebird </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release. The devices will be optional on the <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> 88 <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> and 98 Regency, the statement said. All other 1990-model passenger cars will be equipped with automatic lap-and-shoulder safety belts, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. The automaker said it planned to phase in a passenger-side air bag during the early 1990s. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> currently offers optional driver-side air bags on its 1989 Oldsmobile 88 <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> and 98 Regency and <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DeVille </ORGANIZATION> and Fleetwood models, the statement said.

Air bags currently are standard on some of its Dodge, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> models. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it would offer air bags as standard equipment on 11 of its 1990 car lines.

 Attorneys for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> have asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to consider removing the judge in charge of the settlement of insider trading charges against the deposed bond financier and his former employer, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, unnamed sources quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> today said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, chief investment officer of <ORGANIZATION> Solomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, was negotiating with prosecutors to cooperate in the government's case against <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. He would be the first <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> client to testify against <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> should he become a witness. The investigation is believed to focus on allegations of `` parking'' of junk bonds and stocks by <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>'s company, according to the Journal. When parking occurs securities are bought with the understanding that they'll be sold back to the original owner, usually at a prearranged time and price. The process is intended to hide their true ownership to avoid tax or disclosure obligations. The petition filed Wednesday asks the court to hear their appeal of a lower court decision allowing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> to preside over the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> Lawyers for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, who also was named in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> suit filed last September, claim <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> should be disqualified because his wife stands to make $ 30 million from a leveraged buyout <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> helped finance. They allege the transaction represents a conflict of interest for <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, who must approve any final settlement between <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> were charged last week with a range of criminal securities law violations in a 98-count racketeering and fraud indictment that capped a two-year government investigation. A bond hearing on the charges, in which the government is seeking $ 1.8 billion in penalties, is set for Friday. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> headed <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s California-based high-yield junk bond division and made a reported $ 550 million in 1987 before stepping down after the indictment to prepare his defense. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> petition came after the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in late February refused to rehear a bid to remove <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> from the case. But that court did grant a stay against <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> issuing any rulings. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> settlement is a crucial precondition to resolving criminal securities fraud charges against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. The firm in December agreed to pay $ 650 million and plead guilty to six felonies to settle the criminal charges with the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. Negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> hit a roadblock last month over the federal government's demand to fire <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> before the pact was reached. That condition, though, may be be moot since <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has left the firm. A majority of the 12-member appeals court rejected a bid to allow the full panel to hear the case against <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>. But in a dissent, four judges said the the case would continue under `` a cloud'' if <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> were allowed to preside. Both a district court judge and a three-member appeals court panel also rejected dismissing <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>. `` We're faced with a situation where we are in a litigation with a potentially adversarial party, namely <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, where that party was responsible for $ 30 million going to the wife of the judge,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. `` We think that is a perception that merits the judge stepping aside,'' he said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s lawyers also are challenging the criminal fraud settlement in federal court, saying it violates his rights by forcing the firm to fire him and withhold his 1988 pay of more than $ 100 million.

<HEAD>Employers' Group Calls For Importing Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> employers on Thursday urged the government to import foreign workers to ease the British colony's acute labor shortage. The Joint Associations Working Group said importing workers is essential to avoiding an inflationary spiral and an erosion of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s ability to compete with its Asian neigbors. The group estimated <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> needs about 50,000 imported workers, most of them unskilled, to help fill what it estimated were 200,000 job vacancies. The group's chairman, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>, a senior executive at <ORGANIZATION> Jardine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matheson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said there was a great danger that <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> could `` lose its competitiveness in the manufacturing sector, the hotel industry and elsewhere'' because of the shortage of workers. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government announced on Tuesday that it was considering easing restrictions on the employment of foreign laborers. Under existing policy, only foreign workers with skills not available locally are allowed to work in the colony. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate, currently running at 1.3 percent, is considered to be a key factor behind the economy's growth slowing to an expected 6 percent this year, less than half the 1987 rate. The labor shortage is due to the combination of a steady brain drain as the colony approaches its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and tight immigration laws. While emphasizing that `` there are no viable alternatives to importing workers,'' the report said the government should help encourage automation and productivity through tax breaks and reducing red tape.

<HEAD>USAir, Teamsters To Begin Contract Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> has told the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> it would begin negotiating with the union on a contract for some 4,000 fleet service workers in 101 cities, according to a newspaper report. But the airline has n't dropped its opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, which narrowly won an election last December to expand its representation of fleet services workers from 1,900 in four cities to the entire <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> system, today's <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, that it would appeal last Friday's dismissal of a lawsuit it filed challenging the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to certify the union as representing the 4,000 workers. The nation's seventh-largest airline said through spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> that it would bargain in good faith as it pursues the suit, which accuses the board of failing to investigate alleged election improprieties. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON>, director of the Teamster's airline division, called the company's decision to bargain for all 4,000 baggage handlers, air freight handlers and catering employees a victory. `` For them to come out and say they would recognize 101 cities, they were eating crow,'' he told a packed membership meeting Wednesday at a motel near the Greater <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Prior to the December election, which the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> won by only a four-vote margin, the union had represented 1,900 workers at airports in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, N.Y. The election gave the union the right to extend its representation to 900 former employees of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> who lost their Teamster affiliation when the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> carrier was merged into <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> last year, and to another 1,200 previously unorganized workers at smaller <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> stations. The Teamsters, currently working under a contract that has been open for amendment since July 1987, also are asking a federal court to order <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> to grant the union access to work sites and employee records and to set up a grievance procedure for those not previously represented, Genoese said. The union is seeking elimination of a two-tier wage system and retroactive pay increases of 10 percent annually. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> has offered 3 percent wage hikes and some benefit improvements, according to the union, but wants to maintain the lower rate scale for workers hired after May 1985.

 The stock market declined broadly today as investors cautiously awaited monthly statistics on employment. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.23 to 2,298.57 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 279 up, 604 down and 568 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 21.24 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Interest rates moved up a bit in the government securities market this morning in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report due out Friday on the employment situation for March. Private analysts' estimates call for the data to show a slowing of employment growth, and perhaps an increase in the unemployment rate to 5.2 percent from February's 15-year low of 5.1 percent. That would tend to corroborate recent evidence that economic growth has been slowing of late, taking upward pressure off inflation and interest rates. However, investors' concerns lately have focused more on the possibility of a recession. Brokers also said bond and stock traders seemed to be leery of any unpleasant surprises in the jobs report.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> airlines received fewer complaints from passengers in the first quarter of this year than in the same period of 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> announced today. The department also said, however, that airlines did not do as well in February this year as they did last year when it came to arriving on time, mainly because the weather was worse. The department's monthly air travel consumer report showed consumer complaints against leading airlines totaled 970 in March, down 63 percent from the 2,651 received in March, 1988, and 15 percent from the 1,138 reported in February of this year. Complaints for the first quarter of 1989 totaled 3,207, compared with 8,633 in the first quarter of 1988. The 13 largest domestic carriers reported that 72.4 percent of their flights operated on time in February, compared with 76.7 percent in January and 74.7 percent in February, 1988. The department said the increase in delays was due largely to winter weather conditions. Delays caused by mechanical problems are not counted in compiling the data. Mishandled baggage reports against carriers in February declined, averaging 7.36 per 1,000 passengers compared to 7.86 percent in January and 8.75 in February 1988.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee today approved a bill that would remove remaining price controls from natural gas on Jan. 1, 1993. Approval by the energy and power subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> came on a voice vote, sending the bill to the full committee. A similar bill has been introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The subcommittee's action ratified a consensus achieved earlier this year in back-room negotiations among all the major factions involved in what has sometimes been one of the most bitter fights in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. From 33 percent to 40 percent of all natural gas, which supplies roughly a quarter of the nation's energy needs, is still sold at controlled prices. The controls, established in 1954, have evolved through several control schemes since then. A partial decontrol in 1985 confounded many observers when it was followed by a price collapse, driving some well operators to accept prices below their ceilings. The gas still under controls comes from wells that were in production in 1977. The average March spot price in producing states, as reported by the newsletter <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>, was $ 1.44 per thousand cubic feet; contracts for pre-1977 gas range down to about 30 cents per thousand cubic feet. A 1978 bill established several price categories for gas discovered after that date, some of which became free of controls in 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> allowed the lower-priced categories of the rest of the post-1978 gas to rise to the highest price, which was above the market price.

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today began writing legislation to bail out the troubled savings and loan industry as <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators underscored the urgency of the situation by announcing that deposit withdrawals remained at near-record levels in February. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> announced that depositors withdrew $ 9.4 billion from <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls in February, down only slightly from the all-time record of $ 10.6 billion in withdrawals in January. For just the first two months of this year, withdrawals have totaled $ 20 billion, more than double the net withdrawals for all of 1988, which were $ 8.6 billion. Analysts attributed the bulk of the withdrawals in both January and February to the failure of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to keep pace with rising interest rates offered by competitors, principally money market mutual funds. The latest bad news on declining deposits came as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee on financial institutions began voting on the first of several of the 165 proposed amendments to the S & amp; L legislation. The subcommittee, which includes all but four members of the full committee, voted 35-12 to adopt an amendment that would leave the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulatory agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, with even less authority than proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The amendment, offered by Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, gives the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, rather than the bank system, primary authority to regulate state-chartered S & amp; Ls. The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., also adopted by voice vote an amendment providing fixed four-year terms to the chairman and vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which now insures deposits in commercial banks and would also become responsible for insuring S & amp; L accounts The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had proposed making the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> serve at the pleasure of the president. A third amendment, offered by Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, encourages state housing authorities to buy repossessed S & amp; L properties from the federal government. The subcommittee planned to meet all day today and for two days next week. In a further indication that the legislation may face slow going, the full committee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, earlier said he doubted the subcommittee has set aside enough time and promised to reconsider any of the amendments if sponsors believe they received short shrift in the subcommittee. `` I'm not going to be party to a stampede, to act in great haste only to repent later at great leisure,'' he said. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the legislation appears to moving at a faster pace. The Banking Committee chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., told members of his panel that Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, intends to have the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on the bill during the week of April 17 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee met privately for five and a half hours Tuesday, eight hours Wednesday and plans another session today. `` It looks like many, most, of the controversial decisions will be made behind the closed doors of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ no votes, no fingerprints, no political blood,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. One possible snag in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s effort to scrap the part of the administration plan that would keep $ 50 billion in <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L spending from counting as part of the budget deficit, with many Democrats lining up behind <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> and most Republicans opposed. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee staff, said panel members Wednesday did not resolve the question, but he said Democrats were `` sending a strong signal'' that <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s funding package remained `` clearly viable'' despite administration attempts to squelch it. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, has put together a similar amendment in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but on Wednesday he said he was concerned about reaction in financial markets and had not decided whether to offer it. However, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> today strongly supported including S & amp; L spending in the budget, criticizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for going `` the budget gimmick route _ the most expensive route.'' `` I know that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is stuck with his ` read my lips' statements, but this committee's responsibility goes beyond campaign slogans,'' he said In another development Wednesday Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, in an effort to persuade <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to accept the main features of the administration's proposal, warned that he may recommend a veto of any rescue package that gives the industry too much leeway in getting its financial house in order. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told a small group of reporters that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be `` asking for a repeat of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L -RRB- problem some time in the future'' if it passed bailout legislation that postponed the 1991 deadline set by the <ORGANIZATION> administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to beef up their capital.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today renewed his threat to veto legislation raising the minimum wage beyond $ 4.25 an hour as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats moved to quickly pass a bill raising the wage floor to $ 4.55. House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and relayed his comments to reporters, said the president `` made it abundantly clear there will be absolutely no flexibility, not one penny, not one deviation'' from his position on the minimum wage <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with Republican congressional leaders hours before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opened debate on the legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., would raise the hourly minimum from $ 3.35 to $ 4.65 by January 1992 and contains no provision allowing a lower wage for new workers But <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> aides said he would offer an amendment making his measure identical to the House bill passed two weeks ago, which has a final wage of $ 4.55 and would allow employers to pay new entrants in the job market a `` sub-minimum'' for two months. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has insisted that employers be allowed to pay any new employees a sub-minimum `` training wage'' for six months. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he also reiterated his opposition to shortening that time frame. Another of the Republicans with whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met, Sen. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, R-Miss., told reporters afterward that `` the message that was given to the president by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- GOP -RRB- leadership was that we're going to stand with him on the minimum wage issue And we urged him not to back down from his commitment to $ 4.25 and the six-month training wage.'' Republicans could thwart the Democrats' quick-passage strategy by staging a filibuster, but an aide to one leading GOP senator said there were no plans to do that. The aide said it appeared the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had the votes to win passage of their plan by early next week. Meanwhile, a new poll said there was overwhelming public support for an increase in the minimum wage, which has been at $ 3.35 since 1981. The Washington Post @ <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> survey, conducted March 30 through April 3, said 84 percent of respondents backed an increase while 14 percent did not. Eighty-two percent said they favored an increase even if it would trigger higher consumer prices. But only about half of the 84 percent who initially favored a higher minimum wage said they would hold to that opinion even if it meant businesses would stop hiring, or would fire, workers because of added payroll costs caused by a higher minimum wage. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. By agreeing to amend his bill, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, provided the amended version wins passage, averts the need for a conference committee to resolve differences between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions. A number of other amendments were also expected, including a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> attempt to substitute <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal. A lobbyist in favor of raising the minimum wage said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s repeated veto threats had all but quashed any hopes by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> sponsors of avoiding a showdown with the president `` He says he wo n't compromise so I do n't see a need for us to do anything except send him our bill,'' said <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlotten </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been adamant in saying he would veto the House-passed bill and appears to have the votes to sustain a veto in both chambers of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. While the House-passed bill cuts the final target of the hourly minimum wage to $ 4.55, it moves up the effective dates of the three increases from Jan. 1 to Oct. 1 _ meaning the first increase would come this year and the last jump would occur Oct. 1, 1992. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed three 30-cent increases in the minimum wage beginning Jan. 1, 1990, and ending two years later with the hourly minimum at $ 4.25. The president said his support for those increases hinges on a provision allowing employers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage for six months regardless of any past experience with another employer. The sub-minimum, under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan, would be $ 3.35 an hour after the first increase in the minimum wage. It would rise to $ 3.40 an hour by 1992. The House-passed bill sets the wage for new hires _ provided it is their first job _ at $ 3.35 effective Oct. 1. When the subsequent increases in the minimum wage took effect the sub-minimum would rise as well, to 85 percent of the minimum. The provision allowing the new-hire wage would expire on Sept. 30, 1992.

 Angry state officials asked the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to take the helm of the cleanup of the nation's worst oil spill, and the fired captain of the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> left a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> jail today after posting a reduced bond. Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> posted the $ 25,000 bail, slashed from $ 1 million by a judge who called the higher amount set by another judge `` unconstitutionally excessive.'' On Wednesday, an enraged Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohl </PERSON> set the bail and said of the spill, `` We have a man-made destruction that has not been equaled, probably, since <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> spent Wednesday night in jail on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where he lives, and an extradition request was pending. Also Wednesday, two oil companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> _ limited gasoline deliveries to distributors in Western states in what one official called the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gas rationing since the Arab oil embargo of 1973. Both companies said the rationing was to prevent the hoarding of gasoline in the wake of the spill. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, officials from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and the state of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> were called to the Capitol to brief members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today on the spill. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> testified that contingency plans were never adequate to handle an oil spill the size of the current one. He said it was too early to place blame, but that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> did not have enough equipment on hand. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> chairman L.G. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON>, in his prepared statement, again apologized on behalf of his company for the spill, but said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s response to the accident was `` immediate and thorough. With the slick now larger than <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rear </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to take control of the cleanup. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> indicated he would, but a formal decision was pending. The governor charged that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has been too bureaucratic in overseeing the cleanup, and other state officials complained of a lack of planning and inadequate updates. `` We think there has to be a much more disciplined management structure,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> told reporters. `` Maybe that's been the problem all along. You need a military system to get things done.'' In his letter to <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> noted that less than 4 percent of the 10.1 million gallons of oil spilled in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> on March 24 had been recovered, and that the slick had reached the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON> said the company believed it was the best organization to manage the effort. `` We gathered all the resources and organized the cleanup,'' he said. `` We think the most effective and efficient way to carry out this project is -LRB- for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to continue.'' The tanker was freed from <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>, 25 miles outside <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, with an infusion of compressed, inert gas into its hull, a rising tide and a nudge from six smoke-belching tugboats, which steered it on a slow 30-mile journey to a remote cove. Two skimmers and boats pulling two containment booms trailed the tanker, mopping up a sheen of oil. The ship had to evade thousands of icebergs, some as big as houses. `` We're not going to move fast,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorski </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s salvage coordinator `` We're trying to work our way around these little dorky bits out here.'' A newspaper, meanwhile, reported that a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> investigator speculated that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> unknowingly had set the ship on a collision course with the reef and then apparently placed it on automatic pilot without telling the third mate. The uncertified third mate was in command when the ship ran aground, but the investigator said there was no way to confirm if being on automatic pilot played a part in the accident, the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. Asked about the report, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Meidt </PERSON>, said: `` None of the facts in that story are in dispute to the best of my knowledge.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, however, released a statement saying neither it nor the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> have confirmed the investigator's `` opinions and speculations.'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, is charged with operating a ship while drunk, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. The misdemeanors carry a maximum penalty of 2 \ years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine upon conviction <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said they are investigating whether <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> could be charged with felony violations of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits negligent discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline has returned to its normal daily amount of 2.1 million barrels, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Oil flow from the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slope </ORGANIZATION> had been cut by 60 percent because of tanker restrictions in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> harbor Oil has floated over 2,600 square miles, soiled 800 miles of coastline, killed thousands of animals and resulted in millions of dollars in losses to fishermen. The <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said it had received inquiries from customers concerned about the spill's effect on seafood. Because of the concerns, it has mailed letters to 20,000 fish brokers, wholesalers, restaurants and supermarkets. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> said the gasoline rationing by his company and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> is the first he could recall since the Arab oil embargo. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to put a cap on its deliveries to wholesalers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> resulted from excessive buying by those distributors in the last week.

 It was the car cool Baby Boomers grooved on. The Mustang, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s breakthrough into lightweight, affordable sports cars, turns 25 this month with an immortalized place in auto history, making its mark the same way the Beatles reshaped rock' n'roll. Teen-agers dreamed of cruising drive-ins in their new <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION> which, like the dreamers themselves, grow older by the year. Some original Mustang drivers say they do n't feel a day older than when they slid behind the wheel for the first time. `` It felt great,'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> remembered about the day 25 years ago when he drove the first Mustang ever made at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, assembly plant, where 52 of the cars an hour still roll off the line. <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> of East Detroit got into the Mustang love affair late. But she got her driver's license late, too. She bought a used'68 Mustang when she got her license in 1973 at age 46. `` It makes you feel young,'' she said at a suburban <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Jeep-Eagle dealership where she and her husband were shopping for a new car. They pulled up in a'66 light blue and white Mustang _ a car she says she wo n't trade. The nation is dotted with <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> clubs and <PERSON> Mustang </PERSON> collectors. About 75 percent of the members in the <ORGANIZATION> Performance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are Mustang owners, said club chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Crites </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Mustang lovers praise what they call the simplicity of the early model, promoting an exuberance and free spirit that captivated young consumers and made <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s rivals rethink and redesign their own sporty models. The original Mustang, unveiled when <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> was president of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, had a base a price of $ 2,368 and featured a 170-cubic-inch, six-cylinder engine. `` It could be fixed by a general novice person in the back yard,'' in the early years, <PERSON> Crites </PERSON> said. `` Simplicity has gone out with cheap gas.'' <PERSON> Crites </PERSON> said he's owned about 15 <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION> over the years, and has three in his collection of 25 cars. His favorite Mustang is the 1969 <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shelby </ORGANIZATION> GT 500. Like other Mustang buyers, Crites is proud of how he found his pride and joy. `` In 1970, I went in -LRB- to a dealership -RRB- to buy a truck,'' he said. `` I saw the Mustang sitting there for $ 3,700. I went back two weeks later and they dropped the price by about $ 500.'' Crites drove it away that day. He was one of hundreds of thousands who bought <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION> during the early years. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> formally introduced the car on April 17, 1964, about five weeks after <PERSON> Mustang </PERSON>'s Job 1 rolled out of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> plant Some purists call the first editions 1964 -LCB- models. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> calls them' 65s The first-year sales projection of 100,000 cars was passed in four months. Sales increased to its best year in 1966, when 549,400 Mustangs were driven off <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> dealership lots. The second generation of <PERSON> Mustangs </PERSON>, called the Mustang II, was introduced for the 1974 model year. It was a smaller than the'73, reflecting the need for better fuel efficiency during the oil crunch of the mid-1970s. Mustang sales bottomed out in 1983 at about 117,000 cars, raising predictions that the car, like an aging television sit-com, had finally run out of gas. But last year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sold 170,100 <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION>. The 1989 Mustang, which has a four-cylinder engine, has a base price $ 9,450. An optional beefed-up 5.0-liter engine capable of 223 horsepower compared with 90 horsepower in the basic engine, is a popular seller. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has said it plans to commemorate the Mustang birthday this April 17 with a low-key event at its <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> headquarters but does n't plan a special edition of the car and is leaving the hoopla to others. A caravan of 37 <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION> owned by Europeans is tooling around the country on what's been billed as the `` American Pony Drive.'' The caravan started March 24 in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and winds up May 9 in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. But whether in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or overseas, <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION>'s design has been what's attracted buyers. `` I just like the way it looks,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> said. `` It's sporty looking.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Late 1960 _ Early work began in the development of a lightweight sports car. Early 1962 _ Work got under way in earnest on the vehicle designed to weigh less than 2,500 pounds and cost less than $ 2,500. It went through a number of code names, including Allegro, Cougar -LRB- no relation to the Mercury car -RRB- and T-5. March 9, 1964 _ Job One rolled off the line at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> assembly plant. It weighed 2,572 pounds with base sticker price of $ 2,368.

Fall 1978 _ The third generation of the Mustang was introduced, built on the same platform as <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cougars </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thunderbirds </ORGANIZATION> of the day. The platform is used in the 1989 Mustang. Mid-1981 _ The Mustang GT was reintroduced. Fall 1985 _ <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> added a 5-liter high output engine, an option the car still carries. April 1989 _ <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> quietly celebrates <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION>'s Silver Anniversary. A caravan of 37 <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION> owned by Europeans begins <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour on the `` American Pony Drive.''

 The sale of the first Mustang off the assembly line was a mistake. It had nothing to do with the car. It was the salesman doing his job too well, according to <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, a corporate airline pilot now based in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. `` They should have known better, I guess,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> was 32 when he was in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, driving by <ORGANIZATION> Parsons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> on April 14, 1964. There, on a pedestal, was a white Mustang convertible, with a black interior. `` I went in and said I want to buy it,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> recalled, not knowing that the car was in the eastern <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> province as part of a promotional tour a few days before the Mustang officially was introduced. `` I guess the salesman did n't realize he should n't sell it,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. `` I wrote him out a check and drove the car off.'' A few days later, the dealer called <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> asking him to return the car. `` I said ` No way.' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> called and they could n't get the car back either,'' he said. `` I was driving that thing around for about six months -LRB- in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> -RRB- before I ever saw another,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. `` It felt great. The car was stopping traffic on the streets. People would come over and say, ` What in heaven's name is that?''' In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION> were no strangers on the road. The car got off to one of the hottest starts in automotive history, topping its annual projection of 100,000 sales in the first four months. The appearance of the car was the thing that caught the eye of <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and hundreds of thousands of other buyers in the early days. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> kept the original Mustang for two years. `` After a couple of years, they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- came up with a gimmick and said, ` How about trading the first car in for the millionth?' I was stupid enough to do it.'' The original Mustang, serial number 55F08F100001, is on display now at the <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, unrelated to automobile designer <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> of the 1940s, said he had no problem with the original Mustang during the two years he owned the car During that time, he put 10,000 miles on it, about half of the usual mileage. Open road is scarce on <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>. `` What I'm sorry of in hindsight is getting rid of the first one,'' he said. `` If I had any brains, I would have put it up on blocks and let it appreciate.''

 Stock prices retreated today as investors cautiously awaited monthly statistics on employment. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.46 to 2,292.34 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 476 up, 824 down and 587 unchanged. Interest rates moved up a bit in the government securities market today in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report due out Friday on the employment situation for March. Private analysts' estimates call for the data to show a slowing of employment growth, and perhaps an increase in the unemployment rate to 5.2 percent from February's 15-year low of 5.1 percent. That would tend to corroborate recent evidence that economic growth has been slowing of late, taking upward pressure off inflation and interest rates. However, investors' concerns lately have focused more on the possibility of a recession. Brokers also said bond and stock traders seemed to be leery of any unpleasant surprises in the jobs report.

 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today that government and industry never had a contingency plan sufficient to handle an oil spill the size of the one caused by the Exxon Valdez tanker accident in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. He did not place the blame on anyone specifically, saying, `` it is too early to have factually adequate evidence of culpability.'' `` But my impression is that a somewhat over-optimistic attitude crept in about our readiness and ability to deal with a spill of this magnitude, or even that an accident of this size could occur,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> did not have enough equipment on hand when the spill occurred March 24 in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, disgorging 10 million gallons of crude oil. `` This was compounded by the remote location of the spill, but it goes without saying that every step of the planning for moving Alaskan oil by water had to assume a spill in just this locale,'' said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. On the other side of the Capitol, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans called on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to become directly involved in the clean-up efforts. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> told a news conference called by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the president should immediately put one of the federal agencies in charge of coordinating clean-up. The Republican group also called for legislation that would outline strict contingency plans for future oil spills and place the financial responsibility with the corporation responsible for the accident. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, too, called for updating all contingency plans for oil transportation. `` It is also time to reassess the need for comprehensive oil spill liability and compensation legislation,'' he said, noting that bills have been introduced but never passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> also warned of problems that would occur if a foreign tanker, whose owner had fewer resources than <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, had a similar accident. `` There would be no means under current law to assure that damage costs are met,'' he said. `` Moreover, a significant proportion of the crude oil arriving in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not effectively covered by the four existing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statutes,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, naming sections of the Clean Water Act and the outer continental shelf, deepwater ports and trans-Alaska pipeline acts. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> chairman L.G. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> also appeared before the committee. In his prepared statement, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> again apologized for his company for the spill, but said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s response to the accident was `` immediate and thorough.'' `` Exxon takes full responsiblity, and has done so from the beginning,'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said that as of noon Tuesday, 97 percent of 1 million barrels of crude oil remaining aboard the Exxon Valdez had been removed. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and Fisheries subcommittee on <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and navigation held a hearing simultaneously with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. At that session, Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, said the service has a ban against anybody on duty having a blood alcohol level above .04, but has difficulty determining whether a person is an alcohol abuser. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said that if applicants for pilot licenses do not mention a problem on their applications, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> does not look further. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who was captain of the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, was fired after blood tests showed that his blood alcohol exceeded the accepted level 10 hours after the accident. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> admitted drinking before the accident and was not on the bridge when the tanker went aground. He surrendered Wednesday on charges which included operating a motorcraft while intoxicated. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> disputed <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON>'s contention that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> responded immediately. He told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee the company was slow in its response. Elsewhere on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, a top government investigator told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that alcohol tests on <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel on duty at the time of the accident at a nearby radar station were `` inconclusive'' because they were performed 15 hours after the grounding. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> that urine tests on one guardsman produced a reading of .2 percent, which indicates the presence of a large amount of alcohol. But the guardsman said that when his shift ended, he had had several drinks at home before being recalled to duty for testing, <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of covering up warnings about the potential disaster from an oil spill on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The complaints by the two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrats was over materials prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on oil lease sale 91 off the northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. They said the same environmental findings are the same as those that would apply in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. According to memoranda released by <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> told the minerals management service of the high risk of drilling operations in rough seas, and also cited inadequate technology and equipment for spill cleanup. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said minerals management officials deleted the warnings from their environmental impact statement. The lawmakers called on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to cancel the lease sales. Action has been delayed until a task force appointed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> completes a study that is to take a deeper look at the environmental consequences of drilling.

 Most futures prices for soybeans and corn were higher while most wheat prices were lower at the close Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a choppy market, very quiet,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, CBOT floor operations manager for <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's not an exciting time down here.'' Corn prices were supported by the announcement that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 200,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, said research director <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Reduced domestic demand and increasing supplies from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> weighed on May soybeans, which were off a penny at the close, <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON> said. Wheat was lower on the lack of fresh export news, analysts said. At the close, wheat was unchanged to 6 -RCB- cents lower, with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.97 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 1 cent higher, with May at $ 2.64 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 3 cents higher, with May at $ 1.86 a bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent lower to 4 cents higher, with May at $ 7.14 a bushel.

 The stock market pulled back today as investors cautiously awaited monthly statistics on employment. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.36 to 2,293.44 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 541 up, 804 down and 575 unchanged. Interest rates moved up a bit in the government securities market today in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report due out Friday on the employment situation for March. Private analysts' estimates call for the data to show a slowing of employment growth, and perhaps an increase in the unemployment rate to 5.2 percent from February's 15-year low of 5.1 percent. That would tend to corroborate recent evidence that economic growth has been slowing of late, taking upward pressure off inflation and interest rates. However, investors' concerns lately have focused more on the possibility of a recession. Brokers also said bond and stock traders seemed to be leery of any unpleasant surprises in the jobs report.

 A group led by former baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> has agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 464 million deal that would give the strike-crippled carrier's employees a major share of the company, the parties announced today The deal, subject to approval by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> creditors and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, followed lengthy negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and was greeted with cheers by union members locked in a bitter struggle with Eastern management The purchase also was conditioned on Eastern reaching new work agreements with its striking unions by April 10. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> news conference the purchase includes about $ 200 million in cash and the rest in securities. `` Under this agreement Eastern can be back flying in very short order,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been virtually paralyzed since March 4 by a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike that has drawn the support of pilots and flight attendants. Eastern filed for reorganization and protection from creditors in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on March 9 as its cash dried up. `` To sum it up, it's a mammoth challenge. I'm convinced that there is a spirit amongst the people in the company that I can help bring together to help this airline,'' <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said that if the unions agreed to the deal the nation's seventh-largest airline could resume flying 24 hours later He also said the airline intended to file a bankruptcy reorganization plan that would pay creditors 100 percent. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> will remain in charge of Eastern until the deal is approved, but <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> will participate in formulating the reorganization plan. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> would get $ 200 million cash, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> notes worth about $ 185 million, plus <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets valued at about $ 79 million, including <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Montreal </ORGANIZATION> route plus eight landing slots and one gate at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. About 500 striking Machinists jammed their local union hall in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, chanting and cheering `` Hey, hey! Ho, ho! <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s got to go'' and `` Take me out to the ballgame'' as they heard news of the sale. But <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortis </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> local 702 and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> strike coordinator, said it was impossible to tell whether unions would fare better under the new proposed ownership `` until we get into dealings with Commissioner <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>.'' `` However, we're willing to give it a shot,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> saying the union was encouraged by the announced deal but stressed that strike issues still had yet to be resolved and that the union had not yet been able to review terms of the purchase. The union also noted that other buyout proposals still could be put before the bankruptcy court. `` Nonetheless, what we have heard so far leaves us cautiously optimistic,'' stated <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, chairman of the 3,600-member union. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, who flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> late Tuesday night from his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> home, began personal negotiations with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> early Wednesday morning and continued them until about 8 p.m., resuming talks early today. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s group made a $ 464 million offer for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> last week and then withdrew the bid after being told by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> that it had been topped by another suitor, identified by sources close to the situation as billionaire hotel executive <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>. Under the deal accepted by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON>, a former airline executive from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, would own 30 percent of the airline. Easterns unions would have get another 30 percent of the company in exchange for wage and work-rule concessions. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ardshiel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a smaller <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm, will place securities for the remaining 40 percent of the company. In addition to the airline, the <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> group is buying a 19.9 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s computer reservations system. The reservation network, System One, is comprised of the former systems of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, also owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Many union leaders and rank-and-file members have said they would accept wage and benefit concessions to help resurrect Eastern if they were given independence from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired the 60-year-old carrier in early 1986 for about $ 600 million. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has been vilified by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers as a union-buster who was stripping the airline of its assets and funneling them to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which is substantially non-union. In related developments Wednesday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> appointed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> as examiner in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Chapter 11 reorganization case. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, 60, a senior partner in the firm <ORGANIZATION> Dickstein </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shapiro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, was recommended by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Trustee <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and appointed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> recently ordered the appointment of an examiner, whose unusually broad powers would include a mandate to mediate the bitter labor dispute at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and get the airline flying again. In a separate court action, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> approved an agreement between attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union governing areas where peaceful picketing would be allowed at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Eastern previously asked the judge to restrain union picketing on Eastern property.

That would tend to corroborate recent evidence that economic growth has been slowing of late, taking upward pressure off inflation and interest rates. However, investors' concerns lately have focused more on the possibility of a recession. Brokers also said bond and stock traders seemed to be leery of any unpleasant surprises in the jobs report.

<HEAD>Joint-Venture Steel Plant Dedicated</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURG, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sprawling steel plant that has been modernized at a cost of $ 400 million for use in a joint venture by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company and its South Korean partner was dedicated Thursday while protesters outside burned <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> flags. The 80-year-old factory was renovated as part of a pact between <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and giant <ORGANIZATION> Pohang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and now has an annual capacity of 1.4 million tons of finished steel products, mainly material for tin cans, steel-framed furniture and appliances. The <ORGANIZATION> USS-POSCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plant is part of a 500-acre complex in this community about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, who spoke at the dedication and flipped the switch to put the gleaming machines and computers to work, said joint ventures are an inevitable trend in business and politics. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> commended officials of both companies for `` the vision and dedication to see the rebirth of the steel industry in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' He recalled that experts had predicted the end of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry, but `` fortunately, the pessimists were wrong.'' The plant, which began operation in 1909 and has n't been in full production for almost 20 years, was the scene of a protest by about 500 people, including members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longshoremen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warehousemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> They were objecting to the use of non-union labor to handle the renovation. `` We want people to know how it affects not just the nation, but the local community,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Belleci </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ILWU </ORGANIZATION> member. Plant president <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roskovensky </PERSON>, who said the plant does employ union labor, said the protest stemmed from an ongoing disagreement over the hiring of non-union contractors after a union bid came in far over the cost of non-union labor. Under terms of a 1986 agreement, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> and Pohang each owns half the plant and invested $ 90 million in its rejuvenation. The pact is similar to the agreement between <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> which created <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The balance of the money invested _ $ 220 million _ came from bank financing. Pohang's investment is the largest ever by a South Korean company in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. The plant will be a boon to the local economy, employing some 1,200 people and paying them a total of about $ 46 million annually. The venture already has paid some $ 12 million in state sales taxes. Flanking the podium as <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spoke was a poster showing three workers and the slogan, `` We're a whole new breed of steel-maker.'' Asked whether the plant posed a threat to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> board chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said it was n't going to cause `` one iota'' of trouble. `` This is a solution ... to keep an American steel presence on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' he said. Gen. <PERSON> Tae-Joon </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON>, chairman of Pohang, lauded those who put the deal together despite `` all sorts of odds and difficulties.''

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose in Latest Week to New Record of $301.2 Billion</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 Assets of the nation's 465 money market mutual funds rose by $ 1.16 billion in the latest week to a new all-time high of $ 301.2 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The increase from the previous record of $ 300.04 billion set last week marked the 13th straight weekly all-time high for the funds' assets and reflected the growing attraction of such investments because of rising interest rates. The previous record originally was reported as $ 299.62 billion but the Washington-based mutual fund trade group revised it upward. The <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that in the week ended Wednesday, assets of 231 general purpose funds rose $ 573.3 million to $ 98.62 billion, assets of 94 broker-dealer funds increased $ 462.4 million to $ 129.39 billion, and assets of 140 institutional funds rose $ 128.2 million to $ 73.18 billion. The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in the week ended Tuesday to 9.08 percent from 9.04 percent the previous week, said <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in <LOCATION> Holliston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The 30-day average yield rose to 8.97 from 8.89 percent, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds remained unchanged at 31 days, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to 6.61 percent as of Wednesday from 6.56 percent a week earlier. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, were unchanged at 5.14 percent. Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 9.27 percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 9.17 the previous week. Yields were 9.45 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 9.38 percent; 9.31 percent on 2 -LCB- - year CDs, up from 9.29 percent; and 9.21 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 9.20 percent

 You can still get a $ 100 <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dior </ORGANIZATION> lace nightgown at <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s swank <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> store and buy a good off-the-rack suit from <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, but their retailing parent has undergone a wrenching change in the year since a Canadian developer took it over. <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Bloomie </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s and three other big department store chains, is smaller, leaner and more focused under its new boss, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>. It has fewer stores, fewer employees and a big mountain of debt. It has survived predictions that it would become a financial ruin and retailing disaster. But is it a better company today? `` That remains to be seen,'' says <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubing </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Only now, she said, is <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> emerging from a tumultuous 12-month transition <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> won <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> after a bitter, two-month fight that included a bidding war with rival retailer <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc The takeover cost <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> $ 6.7 billion. He quickly sold four <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> department store chains and its discount and specialty stores to help finance the deal. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> was accused of decimating a fine old retailer, a charge he'd heard before. In December 1986, he bought <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.4 billion, and since then has sold 18 of its 24 store divisions. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella for his retailing and real estate operations, now owns nine department store companies: <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION>, The Bon, <PERSON> Maas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s from Allied; and <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s - <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s It also owns <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> supermarket chain spun off from <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. Besides selling hundreds of stores, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> has cut 9,000 jobs at Federated and Allied, and again been sharply criticized for heavy-handedness. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON> said in an interview that only administrators were laid off and the cuts had `` no effect whatsoever on the customers. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has done what retailing strategists said Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> should have done long before he came along. When the developer first announced his offer for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, securities analysts accused then-Chairman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldfeder </PERSON> of literally giving the store away by failing to streamline the company and make it more competitive. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has cut annual operating costs at Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> by more than $ 350 million a year, said 13D Research Services, a <LOCATION> Yorktown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> firm that analyzes stocks and corporation finances. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock, now trading in the teens, could go as high as $ 66 a share this year, 13D predicted in a report about his business. While analysts agree that <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied needed streamlining, they are concerned about its effect on the retailers. It's not yet known `` if they have done a good job in cutting down costs without destroying the stores,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Stubing </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. But just the fact that the layoffs are behind <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s employees has put the company on a better track, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Everyone's happier,'' <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> said `` The employees are a more cohesive group.'' Some anxieties that prevailed a year ago apparently have not panned out. Many observers said the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stores would become too centralized under <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, and lose their individuality and innovativeness. <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> was reassured a year later, saying, `` Each individual department store company is standing on its own two feet,'' but with some direction from the home office. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> also was accused of buying the companies solely for their lucrative real estate and the entry that stores like <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s would provide into new shopping malls. Real estate, they said, would take priority over good merchandising. <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON> does n't deny that the companies' properties was the principal draw for <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, as it has been for other developers-turned-retailers, such as <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBartolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` You acquire shopping centers a lot easier if you acquire the company,'' <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON> said. However, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is now dependent on retailing for profit, and the real estate end can not survive without good performances from <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied. `` The fact that there is growth in retail sales adds value to the underlying real estate values within retail,'' <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON> said. With that in mind, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has reworked <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s expansion plans to concentrate on its star <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s division. The company aims at opening three new <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s a year, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> also is adding stores to other divisions and plans to expand or remodel more than half its 250 stores over the next five years. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> admitted that `` We did n't spend much of spring'88 running the business,'' because executives were busy cutting costs. The company has made conservative projections for 1989 partly because of the sluggish consumer buying of the past two years. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> hoped for a sales increase of 4 percent, consistent with industry projects at the start of 1989. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth-quarter earnings have n't been announced, but some analysts expect an improvement from the third quarter, when Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> lost a combined $ 53.5 million. The high cost of paying the interest on takeover-related debt was partly to blame. Unlike most other big retailers, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied do not release their sales figures monthly, making it difficult to assess their performance. One industry analyst, who asked not to be identified, estimated that despite marginal sales growth for the year ended Jan. 31, pretax earnings rose 5 percent at <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and 16 percent at Allied, thanks largely to cost cuts. <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> analyst, said he expected <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> to adequately manage the heavy debt load it took on in acquiring <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied. Concerns about that debt wreaked havoc with its financing plans last fall. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> announced in September that <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied lost a combined $ 207 million during the second quarter, when sales slowed. The next month, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s planned $ 1.15 billion high-yield bond sale had to be postponed and restructured. Published reports said buyers hesitated because of the retailer's lackluster sales and losses, but <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said at the time the problem was uneasiness in the high-yield bond market caused by the bidding war in the biggest debt-financed takeover of all, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON> acknowledged that investors were concerned about <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s debt, but he expressed confidence the company can easily handle its interest The transition at <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> has been rocky, but the company says it is largely complete, and analysts will be watching see if the takeover really was a good deal for <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>. Said Ms. <PERSON> Stubing </PERSON>: `` This year is going to be the really telling year.''

<HEAD>NCNB Wants Chance To Present New Takeover Offer To C&amp;S</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it wants to discuss revising its takeover bid for Citizens and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but C & amp; S officials said Thursday the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> banking company has done most of its talking through the news media. `` There has been no communication with the <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S board,'' <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S spokesman <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` They -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are just doing it through the news media, and it makes it hard for C & amp; S to respond.'' The C & amp; S board on Monday rejected an offer, made last week by <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>, of 1.075 shares of <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> stock for each share of <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S common stock. The value of that offer was placed at $ 39 a share, or about $ 2.4 billion. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, N.C.-based <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, said Wednesday his company is willing to raise the price of the offer. He told The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and The Atlanta Constitution that analysts' predictions that the new offer would be $ 44 worth of stock per share were `` in the ballpark.'' <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said, however, that an offer would be negotiated only in a face-to-face situation with <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> has not made an effort to set up such a meeting. But <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Easley </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, said Thursday, `` We have said at every opportunity we are willing at any time to sit down with C & amp; S. From the very beginning, we have said we want to sit down.'' Ms. <PERSON> Easley </PERSON> said she did not know specifically what efforts have been made to set up a meeting with the C & amp; S board. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s comments Thursday were not the first to be critical of <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s communication with <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S. C & amp; S officials last week said they learned of the original offer through a news release before letters to the board outlining the proposal were delivered. The C & amp; S board, in turning down <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s initial offer, said it was inadequate and possibly would not pass regulatory muster. C & amp; S has said the value of the <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> stock may have been inflated by the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> bank's purchase of 20 percent of First RepublicBank in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. That bank is now called <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the C & amp; S board made it clear that <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S is not trying to solicit another offer,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Experts Say NCNB Bid Could Mean Another Protracted Takeover Battle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Six months after <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> won a rare hostile bid to acquire rival <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the banking industry may see another big takeover war. But although the unsolicited $ 2.4 billion buyout proposal by giant <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is in some ways similar to the 13-month battle between <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, the latest deal has some key differences. It's bigger, could be more likely to generate opposition from state and federal regulators and involves two institutions considered strong financial performers. `` I guess I'd have to say it pretty much stops and ends with the fact that both were unsolicited offers,'' said <PERSON> Rodgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a merger specialist with the law firm <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> who is working for Atlanta-based Citizens. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.4 billion hostile takeover battle for <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> was n't the first hostile bank deal, but it was the largest of its kind to succeed in a banking industry that traditionally had relied mainly on friendly deals. `` I think the Irving-Bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> deal definitely broke the ice,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> attorney specializing in bank mergers, said Thursday. `` A lot of people felt that deal was an aberration. But now it's happening again, which is noteworthy.'' Citizens' board of directors on Monday rejected the stock-swap merger proposal by <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, N.C.-based <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> as inadequate. Experts see some similarities between the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> deal and the <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> proposal, but there also are plenty of differences. The combination of the two would result in a bank with assets of around $ 75 billion, placing it firmly in the top 10 among the nation's bank holding companies. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> grew to about $ 50 billion in assets after the Irving acquisition. Also, `` <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> was a mediocre performer that did n't live up to its potential, whereas Citizens has been a strong performer that is living up to its potential,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Keefe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bruyette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> is offering 1.075 of its shares for each of Citizens' stock, or around $ 44 a share The company has hinted it might be willing to raise its bid by around $ 5 a share if Citizens agrees to negotiations. But Citizens' management and many analysts maintain that even that's too low. <ORGANIZATION> NBNC </ORGANIZATION> stock closed unchanged at $ 34.25 a share Thursday. Citizens fdeclined 25 cents to $ 35 a share. Citizens' main criticism of the offer is that the value of <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s stock may have been inflated after <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> took over the management of the banks of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> last year with the government's financial assistance. That bank is now called <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Federal Reserve may look unfavorably upon the acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> of another bank given the fact that they recently received federal assistance to acquire First RepublicBank,'' <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> _ who represented <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> in its fight for <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> _ said Thursday that no negotiations have been held and none are planned with <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>. He said the company has not been talking to any other potential suitor. `` It's quite clear Citizens wants to remain independent,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. After Citizens' board rejected <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s offer it amended the company's bylaws to make a takeover more difficult, applying provisions <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover law. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> relied on a similar <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law, but lost several key court challenges to the statute. Also unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Irving </ORGANIZATION> battle, the <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> proposal reaches across state lines. `` It's likely that there will be a lot more politics involved in this battle ... -LRB- because -RRB- it's likely it would result in the reduction of jobs,'' said <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>. `` <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> has a very strong track record of cutting costs and reducing staff.'' While <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal calls for continuation of Citizens and Southern's management and independent operations, banking experts said they were doubtful <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> would be a hands-off partner. `` First RepublicBank is a prime example. After they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- took that over they changed the name,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggar </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market lapsed into a sluggish decline Thursday as investors cautiously awaited monthly statistics on employment. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.83 points to 2,291.97. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 581 up, 842 down and 538 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 146.53 million shares, down from 165.88 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 173.52 million shares. Interest rates moved up a bit in the government securities market in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report due out Friday on the employment situation for March. Private analysts' estimates call for the data to show a slowing of employment growth, and perhaps an increase in the unemployment rate to 5.2 percent from February's 15-year low of 5.1 percent. That would tend to corroborate recent evidence that economic growth has been slowing of late, taking upward pressure off inflation and interest rates.

 The dollar was generally higher in listless trading Thursday as the foreign exchange markets awaited fresh economic figures from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Gold prices advanced slightly. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 383.60 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up 30 cents from late Wednesday's $ 383.30. The dollar moved in a narrow range as many traders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> chose to sit out the session and wait for Friday's release of unemployment figures for March. If the report from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> shows continued economic strength, the dollar could rise on the expectation that interest rates will continue to go up. Higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates are bullish for the dollar because they make the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency more attractive to foreign investors. Traders were also cautious ahead of next week's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit figures for February, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a senior trader with <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. A dealer in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said the dollar held at the same rate for five hours during trading there `` Nothing is happening. ... No one knows which way the dollar should go,'' he said. The dollar began its day in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where it closed at 132.15 Japanese yen, up from 131.37 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded lower at 132.08 yen, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency moved higher in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, closing at 132.275 yen, up from 131.555 yen late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.7035 late Thursday, more expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $ 1.7028. But the pound slipped in later <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading to $ 1.7005 from $ 1.7030 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.8730 West German marks, up from 1.8695; 1.6445 Swiss francs, up from 1.64125; 6.3250 French francs, up from 6.3090; 1,373.50 Italian lire, up from 1,371.00; and 1.19325 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19075. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Wednesday's late rates, included: 1.8700 West German marks, up from 1.8695; 1.6415 Swiss francs, up from 1.6395; 6.3125 French francs, down from 6.3150; 2.1090 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1125; 1,371.75 Italian lire, down from 1,372.50, and 1.1935 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1895 Gold bullion prices were higher, but traders said there was little interest in the metal. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold traded at a late bid price of $ 384.75 a troy ounce, up from $ 383.50 on Wednesday. The late Zurich price was bid at $ 384.35 an ounce, up from $ 383.35.

 <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s deal to buy strike-ravaged <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> got a boost from two sources that have been getting a black eye from prosecutors: junk-bond powerhouse <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its indicted financier, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, the ex-baseball commissioner, told reporters at a Thursday news conference to announce the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> called him two weeks earlier and offered constructive ideas on how to proceed. He did not specify what those ideas were but quoted <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> as strongly advising him to `` focus on the jobs.'' <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> also put in a good word for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fifth-largest investment banking firm that has played crucial roles in some of the biggest takeovers of the decade `` Maybe some of you do n't want to here this but I think it's essential,'' <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said `` The company _ <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, not us _ retained <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> and they have been helpful in this transaction on the company side and will be, overall, helpful to complete the transaction.'' Under the arrangement outlined by <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> will provide $ 300 million in debt-financing for the deal, which has been valued at $ 464 million. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> have been battling negative publicity since they were implicated in wide-ranging securities fraud by now-imprisoned speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> more than two years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed to plead guilty to six fraud felony charges in December, and a grand jury indicted <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and two others on fraud and racketeering charges March 29. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has asserted innocence. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, said he was unaware of <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s remarks and could not comment further. Officials at <LOCATION> Robinson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lerer </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, the public relations firm hired by <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> to speak for him, would not comment. Eastern's employees struck March 4 after a prolonged feud with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, whom they accused of stripping the airline's assets, eliminating jobs and scheming to crush the unions. Eastern sought bankruptcy refuge March 9 and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> peddled it for sale.

 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply fell in the week ended March 27, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,079.9 billion from a revised $ 3,085.3 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,962.8 billion from $ 3,965.8 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 787.1 billion from $ 786.9 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in M3. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,072.1 billion, a 2.3 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,937.4 billion, up 4 percent, while M1 was flat at an average of $ 787.1 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 511 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from $ 491 million in the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said net free reserves totaled $ 1,049 million in the two weeks ended April 5, up from a revised $ 328 million a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 288.2 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, down from $ 289.7 billion two weeks earlier

 Retailing giant <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday reported robust sales growth for the first month of its new low-pricing policy but analysts said it will take many months to judge whether <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' determination to beat competitors is paying <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said its sales rose 11.9 percent in the five weeks ended April 1 to $ 2.97 billion from $ 2.66 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier. Sales at <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stores open for at least a year increased a solid 9.6 percent during the five weeks. The industry considers these same-store sales a better measure of a retailer's performance than totals that includes the take at newly opened stores. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the March volume turned out even better than the company had hoped. `` Clearly, everyday low prices are well-understood and popular with the public and we are pleased with the response to our strategy,'' <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON> said. The launch of its `` everyday low price'' program, which was promoted with an aggressive advertising campaign estimated by outsiders to have cost about $ 110 million, definitely brought more customers into <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stores. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON>, a retail specialist with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> Bros.. <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON>, said the sales growth was a `` reflection of people experimenting to see what <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> everyday low pricing is like. `` It shows people are going into the stores to find out what's happening,'' he said One of the strongest points to make about <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' latest same-store sales were that they rose 15.4 percent after adjustment for the loss of 2 -LCB- selling days due to Easter and the closing of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' more than 800 stores nationwide for marking down prices in preparation for the policy switch, <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON> said. The markdowns were part of a broad effort by <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> to hoist its sagging merchandise operation. The retailer also is adding national brands to its mostly private-label lineup and cutting costs to recapture lost market share. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, which maintained its ranking as the country's biggest retailer with 1988 revenue of $ 30.3 billion, has watched its market share shrink this decade as go-go discounters such as <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and specialty merchants have developed significant followings among shoppers. Industry analysts said the test will be whether <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> manages to maintain the sales momentum, especially after the fan-fare over the changes adopted by the 102-year-old retailer dies down. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' advertising already has returned to a more normal level <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sack </PERSON>, a retail analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> definitely enjoyed a far better month than many of the other retailers that reported results on Thursday. No. 2 retailer <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, described its sales as `` disappointing'' and blamed the weather, in part Analysts said some of the weakness in sales at K mart and other chain stores may have been the result of all the hoopla generated by <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> policy shift but it is difficult to quantify precisely how much sales revenue might have been taken away by <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>. `` It will really take the better part of a year to determine whether their new policy is really taking hold,'' <PERSON> Sack </PERSON> said. Analysts are awaiting an indication if <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' bottom line is benefiting from the reduced prices. A <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the company has been mum about predicting any impact on its earnings.

 Taking advantage of strike-hobbled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION>'s absence in some lucrative markets, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced plans Thursday to add 11 flights in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and 13 in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> by June. The expansion had been part of American's long-term planning, but the timing was pushed ahead by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike that has left <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flying only about 10 percent of its schedule since March 4. Eastern's potential for returning to full operation with <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s group announcing a deal Thursday to buy the Miami-based carrier did n't bother American. `` The likelihood is that Eastern will still be the largest carrier'' in the region, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s senior vice president for operations. `` None of what we have announced today will rise and fall on what happens to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> or anyone else.'' American is expanding from 20 to 31 flights a day in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and from 45 to 52 flights a day in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, adding other flights from domestic points to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and switching to larger aircraft on 11 <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> flights for a total addition of 3,219 seats per day, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Service from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> also would be added if American wins federal and foreign approval for requested flights to <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> Cit, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, he said. The expansion will give American 94 daily departures from 10 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities, well behind <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern's old schedule. `` American is building here in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for the long-term, and clearly a large part of our future revolves around <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, Texas-based carrier has more than 300 aircraft on order and will have 485 in service as of Friday with the addition of its newest A-300 Airbus, he said.

 Cocoa futures prices fell sharply Thursday because of concerns about large supplies, while grain futures finished mixed after choppy trading. On other futures markets, energy prices were mixed, livestock and meat slumped and precious metals were fairly steady. The May contract for cocoa tumbled $ 50 a ton at mid-session, then recovered to finish down $ 35 on the Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Especially in the nearby months, it was a major loss here today,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is really a depressed market.'' Traders are seeing `` a negative global supply-demand balance, an increase in the availability of physical cocoa, especially cocoa originating in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. And there's a narrowing of cash-futures prices.'' It was reported Thursday that <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> expects to be able to meet increased demands for its crop. Cocoa settled $ 10 to $ 35 lower, with the contract for delivery in May at $ 1,300 a ton. Most futures prices for soybeans and corn were higher while wheat was mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a choppy market, very quiet,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, CBOT floor operations manager for <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's not an exciting time down here.'' Corn prices were supported by the announcement that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 200,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, said research director <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. While most soybean contracts were higher, reduced domestic demands and increasing supplies from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> weighed on the May contract, which was off a penny at the close, <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON> said. Wheat was depressed by the lack of fresh export news, analysts said. Wheat settled 2 cents higher to 3 -RCB- cents lower, with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.00 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 3 \ cents higher, with May at $ 2.65 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 3 -RCB- cents higher, with May at $ 1.86 -RCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent lower to 5 -LCB- cents higher, with May at $ 7.14 a bushel Most livestock and meat futures prices were lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are a lot of bellies in storage and the cash price is lower,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, a livestock analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said traders were caught by surprise by a price plunge in the cattle complex, although there has been a recent trend of `` buying hogs and selling cattle.'' Cattle settled .38 cent to .52 cent lower, with the contract for April at 77.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .70 cent lower to 1.20 cents lower, with April at 78.67 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent to .60 cent higher, with April at 39.97 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .52 cent higher to .40 cent lower, with May at 34.40 cents a pound. Precious metals were steady on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as traders await Friday's national unemployment figures. `` It was very quiet, with traders taking a wait and see attitude. The dollar had little effect,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Gold usually moves in the opposite direction of the dollar Gold settled 10 cents to 20 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in April at $ 384 a troy ounce; and silver was .2 cent higher to .5 cent lower, with April at $ 5.80 a troy ounce. Energy futures prices were mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the market was pausing after last week's huge run-up following the Alaskan oil spill disaster. Crude oil settled 48 cents higher to 19 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in May at $ 19.80 a barrel; heating oil was .27 cent higher to .41 cent lower, with May at 51.22 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was 1 cent to 1.88 cents lower, with May at 64.55 cents a gallon.

 About 300 striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> workers and their supporters rallied outside an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> travel office Thursday to protest an internal memo naming <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> a preferred carrier. The memo obtained by the striking <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union asks Atlanta-area travel agents to follow a priority list of carriers when booking customers who give no preference. The March 22 letter from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Membership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> ends by saying, `` Please keep this information confidential and do not discuss with anyone outside of our organization.'' For domestic service, the memo says its `` highly preferred'' domestic carriers, in order, are American, USAir-Piedmont, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> airlines. For Pacific routes, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> airlines are preferred. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> are specifically excluded from all lists. `` A lot of our people carry <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> cards, and they're appalled that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> is aligning itself with <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>,'' chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> vice president `` It's really hard to understand.'' <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> books with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> because of the airline's special offers, said company spokesman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` Like most other travel agencies, we have some special relationships with a number of airlines so we can get even better service,'' such as access to better seats and fares, she said. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Groves </PERSON>, manager of the picketed travel office, said the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> memo did not govern operations in his office, and he followed no priority list for booking flights. Striking Eastern workers have been trying to get fliers to boycott <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> since the strike began March 4 because of their common ownership.

 Federal regulators took over 38 more savings and loan associations in eight states Thursday, bringing the total under government control to 215 in 31 states. The institutions _ in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ were the latest to be taken over in a program being administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates commercial banks, is going into the sickest S & amp; Ls with the goal of minimizing losses until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriates the money to shut them down or sell them to new owners. The first legislative votes were taken on the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout legislation on Thursday when members of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee began considering 165 proposed amendments. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> began the takeover program at the direction of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Feb. 7 and plans to assume control of 17 more institutions within the next few weeks. In announcing the latest <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L takeovers on Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> emphasized that the institutions will remain open as usual and that all deposits are guaranteed up to the $ 100,000 insurance limit. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> said that the regulatory oversight teams being put into the institutions would work to minimize operating losses and ensure that the institutions were operated in a safe and sound manner. The largest of the 38 institutions taken over on Thursday was <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> with assets of $ 1.44 billion at the end of 1988. Of the institutions handled Thursday, 12 were located in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and 11 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The 38 institutions included: <LOCATION> CALIFORNIA </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> Cabrillo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hayward </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Founders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Manteca </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northridge </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Arrowhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Perpetual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> sand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Westlake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> COLORADO </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> IOWA </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> Sioux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, Cherokee; 1st <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estherville </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Emmetsburg </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> ILLINOIS </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Libertyville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Libertyville </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> KANSAS </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>.

 Energy futures were mostly lower in moderate trading Thursday, led by falling gasoline prices as oil shipments in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> returned to normal. Unleaded gasoline had risen more than 13 cents since the giant spill off the Alaskan coast on March 24. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, unleaded gasoline for May delivery dropped 1.88 cents to 64.55 cents a gallon from 66.43 a gallon on Wednesday. Other contract months were mixed. The May contract for heating oil fell .41 cent to 51.22 cents from 51.63 cents in the previous session, while other contracts also declined. Meanwhile, the May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, settled down 19 cents at $ 19.80 a barrel. Analysts said gasoline prices were in for a technical correction after soaring in the week following the oil spill and the closure of the port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. `` Prices reflected mostly a technical change rather than anything fundamental,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Redoglio </PERSON>, energy broker with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said oil shipments from the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> port exceeded 1.3 million barrels on Thursday while 2 million barrels are normally shipped.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, under the cloud of $ 9.4 billion in fresh deposit withdrawals from the nation's savings and loan institutions, began amending President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bailout bill Thursday and immediately got into a dispute over reopening some of last year's deals that provided $ 38 billion to the industry. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> seized control Thursday of 38 more S & amp; Ls at or near insolvency, raising to 215 the number of troubled thrifts that the agency has put into conservatorships since early February in an effort to prevent the bailout costs from mushrooming. On a bipartisan vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on financial institutions moved immediately to deny <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> some of the controls he had sought over officials running the government's deposit insurance program The subcommittee also amended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal by transferring regulatory oversight of state-chartered but federally insured S & amp; Ls from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in February proposed transferring authority over federally chartered thrifts from the bank board to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates commercial banks But the committee rejected an amendment by Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> to allow 31 of the nation's largest thrifts, many of them in his home state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, to become banks and escape future insurance liability for the costs of the S & amp; L bailout. The panel also balked temporarily at an effort by Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Ga., to prevent the government from recovering some of the billions of dollars in long-term aid it committed last year to buyers of 179 insolvent thrifts Subcommittee members also questioned the legality of many of last year's bailouts, saying the bank board had committed billions of dollars <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had not authorized it to spend. <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>., said some of those deals were with multimillionaires who put up little or none of their own money In one December transaction, government aid exceeded the nearly $ 6 billion combined costs of the 1970s bailouts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the 1980 bailout of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, according to auditors. <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, in the face of strong opposition, temporarily withdrew his amendment to prevent the government from seeking to recover from holding companies some of the subsidies the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> had promised to S & amp; L purchasers. But he complained that `` all of a sudden we are weaseling on commitments that were made.'' In all the subcommittee has before it 165 proposed amendments to the administration's proposal. The bank board, meanwhile, released figures showing that depositors removed $ 9.4 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls in February, the fourth straight month of heavy withdrawals. The nation's 2,939 thrifts hold $ 957 billion in deposits. Withdrawals since October total $ 35.4 billion. January's withdrawals amounted to $ 10.6 billion, according to revised figures. Bank board officials attributed the February slowdown in the outflow to higher interest rates being offered by many S & amp; Ls. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> has said he expects the withdrawals to stop if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bailout plan, estimated to cost at least $ 157 billion and, perhaps, more than $ 200 billion over the next 10 years, depending on economic conditions. The subcommittee adopted by voice vote an amendment providing four-year terms to the chairman and vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan would take over insuring <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L deposits from the bank board's insolvent <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. Currently, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> _ now <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> _ is chosen by its other two board members. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to have the chairman report to the secretary of the treasury, who could hire and fire the chairman at will. `` A lot of the problem -LRB- in -RRB- where we are now is the lack of independence by regulatory agencies,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoagland </PERSON>, D-Neb., one of the sponsors of the amendment <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also would leave the bank board and its chairman, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, as the primary federal regulators of state-chartered S & amp; Ls. But, in an indication of disappointment with the way Wall has done his job, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, won a 35-12 vote on his amendment to transfer that power to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>'s amendment to exempt the 31 large S & amp; Ls from a Bush-proposed five-year moratorium on leaving the thrift insurance fund to escape the higher premiums it charges in relation to what banks pay for deposit coverage was defeated on a 28-17 vote. `` If you let those folks out, you are telling the taxpayers back home you want them to pay more of the burden,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleczka </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., who noted that the 31 thrifts hold about one-fourth of all S & amp; L deposits in the country The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., plans to complete the bill next week and then send it to the full committee, where <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has indicated he may give it lengthy consideration All but four members of the full committee serve on the subcommittee. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the legislation appears to moving at a faster pace, although so far it all has been dealt with only in closed sessions in anticipation of formal open meetings next week. There, the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., told colleagues that Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, intends to have the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on the bill during the week of April 17 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel is scheduled to begin amending <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s package next Tuesday and Wednesday, when <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee will resume its deliberations. In other action on amendments Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel: _ Rejected on a 39-7 vote a measure by Reps. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON>, D-Pa., and <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaptur </PERSON>, D-Pa., aimed at making states where much of the problems have occurred _ chiefly <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ raise state taxes to pay 20 percent of the bailout costs for state-chartered thrifts that went <PERSON> Kaptur </PERSON> blamed loose regulations in those states for 74 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L aid committed by the government last year, saying the costs of bailing out <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions alone will total three times what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent on the <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> plan in rebuilding <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after World War II. But Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the amendment would have sent the bill to `` Fort Sumter and started a second civil war. And, referring to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> questioned whether `` there is a slight chance that a Texan in the White House could sign'' the bill with such a provision. _ Approved on a voice vote a compromise worked out with lobbyists for bankers and thrifts a measure that will allow both federally insured banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to use the same insurance logo but with different names _ Defeated a measure aimed at preventing banks from citing the poor condition of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L insurance pool in their advertisements to lure deposits from thrifts _ Defeated an amendment by <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> that would have ordered the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> to increase the pay of bank and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L examiners by 20 percent at an annual cost of $ 14 million <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> said those examiners are leaving those jobs at rate of 12 percent a year because their annual pay averages less than $ 40,000.

 Jubilant <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strikers cheered and sang `` Take Me Out to The Ball Game'' when an agreement to sell the carrier was announced Thursday, saying they are ready to tighten their belts and show the public what they can do. Details of the proposed sale to a group led by ex-baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> are still unclear. The deal would give <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees a 30 percent share of the airline in exchange for pay cuts and other union concessions possibly totaling $ 250 million. If the union leaders approve, the rank and file say they are willing to live on less to prove they can run an airline better than <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> And, they say, they have shown that an employee's human rights must be respected. `` Whatever happens here at Eastern is going to dictate what happens with the rest of the airlines, and in other industries too,'' said mechanic <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` We had been stripped of our dignity while we were working for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> _ now we have it back, and we are going to rebuild the airline.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, whose wife <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> is a flight attendant at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, said he has no illusions that they can live as well as before the strike. `` It will be painful,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` We have to deprive ourselves of many things we had in the past, but the most important thing is that we are building for the future.'' Employees universally blamed <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s attitude toward workers, not wage disputes, for the atmosphere of crisis that culminated in the March 4 stirke. And they said they were glad to see him go. `` It looks like mighty <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> has struck out,'' laughed <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallavollita </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilot for 26 years. `` We are ready to accept concessions _ if that's what the new management wants, I'll go along with it. Ramp service worker <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorie </PERSON> said the price of the 34-day walkout was expensive, both to the employees and the airline itself. `` We know the airline has been hurt _ how much, we'll have to find out,'' <PERSON> Lorie </PERSON> said. `` We just have to go out there with the best possible mentality.'' Not everyone was ecstatic about the sale, with some saying they want to see the fine print. `` I've seen so much deception that I'm not going to pick up my tools until I've seen -LRB- the contract -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, a maintenance worker for 23 years. But he said he was willing to make concessions to <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>. Most echoed the sentiments of <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Orent </PERSON>, a mechanic who rocked her little girl in a stroller as she listened to the excited chatter at the union hall. `` Even if we do n't all go back to work, for those who do, it's the greatest,'' she said `` <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s gone, he's gone back to wherever he came from, and we do n't want to see him again.''

 A <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> man has been convicted of profiting from insider stock trading in the first such case the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has taken before a jury. After deliberating for about 90 minutes Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury found <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cedarburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, violated civil securities laws when he bought stock in a company knowing his employer was negotiating to buy that company. The six-person jury found no violation on the part of <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> VanMoppes </PERSON>, a broker in the <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hopwood </PERSON>, who executed <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s stock purchases. No criminal charges were brought in the case and none are pending, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidney </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> attorney from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, who tried the case before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zilly </PERSON>. `` This is the first insider-trading case the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has ever tried before a jury,'' Kidney said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> recently ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> may seek insider-trading penalties in addition to the return of illegally obtained profits. But it said such penalties can only be sought before a jury. Previous insider-trading cases have been tried before judges alone. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> regulations prohibit profiting on stock trading when it is based on information not available to the public. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> bought stock in <ORGANIZATION> Affiliated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in December 1984 after he learned his employer, <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Nephew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, was negotiating to buy Affiliated for at least 50 percent more than the current market price of the stock, <PERSON> Kidney </PERSON> said. The shares were traded on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> bought 3,000 shares at prices ranging from $ 17.875 to $ 19.75 a share. The following month, <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Nephew announced its offer to buy Affiliated for $ 36 a share. Two days afterward, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> sold his shares for $ 35.125 apiece, realizing a profit of $ 47,466, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Zilly </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> to pay $ 57,026 as unlawful profits gained by him, his wife and by <PERSON> VanMoppes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zilly </PERSON> said he also will set penalty damages, ranging from one to three times the unlawful profits, after he receives information on <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s financial situation. The court `` will require a penalty in this case to demonstrate to this defendant and to the world that insider trading will not be tolerated,'' <PERSON> Zilly </PERSON> said. Kidney said VanMoppes recommended the Affiliated stock to another client and later bought some himself, based on information from <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> had alleged VanMoppes had used insider information, but the jury found <PERSON> VanMoppes </PERSON> was not liable under insider-trading laws.
