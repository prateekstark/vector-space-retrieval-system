 New <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> power officials warned on Sunday night that blackouts may occur throughout the six-state region Monday unless businesses and homeowners conserve electricity amid the heat wave. A shutdown this weekend of the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yankee </LOCATION> nuclear power plant and one of four power generators on <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has worsened the already difficult power situation for most of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported that 18 cities in the northeastern quarter of the nation reported record high temperatures for the date Sunday, and forecast that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> would have 90s, with 80s in the northern portions, on Monday. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> had an ironic record low temperature of 78 late Sunday afternoon when an ocean breeze cooled the area. But as soon as the winds shifted, the temperature shot up 14 degrees in 10 minutes, the weather service said. Monday `` is definitely a very tight day,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheperdson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pool </ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates power supplies for utilities throughout <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` If we do n't get a considerable contribution by our customers, as we did a number of days last week, we may not be able to provide uninterrupted service,'' <PERSON> Sheperdson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON> called the situation `` tremendously tight'' and said the numbers simply do n't add up for power supply to continue without periodic, controlled blackouts Monday. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> region controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pool </ORGANIZATION> set a record for summertime power demand last Thursday at 19,608 megawatts. The pool is expecting demand to exceed 19,900 megawatts Monday. `` That's 300 megawatts more, plus you're missing <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, which is 860 megawatts,'' <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> shut down over the weekend because of a transformer problem, according to <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON>. The pool is predicting the plant will be out of service until Wednesday at the earliest. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> reported a record for Sunday electricity demand: 7,645 megawatts between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., breaking the record of 6,770 megawatts, set last Sunday. Spokesman <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Gitten </PERSON> said peak demand often occurs at that hour as people return home from weekend activities and turn on air conditioners and lights.

<TEXT>
 In the heart of this Roman Catholic city, one of the latest bits of wall graffiti says `` Abortion Now,'' but someone has blackened the telephone number. The graffiti in St. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Green </PERSON> is emblematic of an ongoing clash _ but not over legalizing abortion. That's already banned in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The struggle is over a woman's right to receive information on obtaining a legal abortion elsewhere. This country, with its 95 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> population, enshrined an abortion ban into its constitution in 1983. Approved by a 2-1 margin in a national referendum, the amendment says a fetus and mother have an equal right to life, which must be defended by the state. Three months ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, ruling on action brought by the country's main anti-abortion group, declared that the amendment made it illegal for pregnancy counseling centers to provide women with any information to help them get a legal abortion. However, university students across the republic have vowed to continue publishing the names and telephone numbers of clinics in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where abortion is legal. `` Access to information is a civil liberty, and prevention of such access is a form of censorship which we should not tolerate,'' said <PERSON> Tadhg </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, president of the 120,000-member Union of Students in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, the plaintiff in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, had sued two pregnancy counseling centers for telling women how to get abortions in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Now it has now targeted <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dublin </ORGANIZATION>, with 10,000 students the country's largest university. On July 1, the anti-abortion society's lawyers wrote to four student leaders threatening legal acton unless they removed the addresses of English abortion clinics from a manual given to students at the start of each academic year. The school's student union president, <PERSON> Diarmuid </PERSON> <PERSON> Coogan </PERSON>, replied that students had voted to include the abortion information and said it will remain in the manual. `` All options should be available to women without pressure to opt for one or the other,'' said <PERSON> Coogan </PERSON>. `` Does the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child intend to put us in jail for implementing the democratically decided mandate of our students?'' <PERSON> Coogan </PERSON> asked. All 40 colleges in the country back <PERSON> Coogan </PERSON> and four, including <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, say they will publish the same abortion information this fall. The national students' body has promised legal assistance to fight attempts to stop publication. <PERSON> Maire </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, said the group will wait to see if the information is in this year's student manuals before deciding on legal action. `` The right to life is written into the constitution, and it overrides the right to information,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said. `` The right to life is paramount. You do n't have an untrammeled right to information, especially if it is going to take the life of a child.'' <PERSON> Coogan </PERSON> retorted that the society wants `` to make abortion not exist.'' `` But thousands of <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> women go over to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> every year for abortions,'' he said. `` If women are going to have abortions, they should have that information.'' According to British government figures, 3,673 women living in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> received abortions in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1987, down from 3,918 in 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said this was the lowest number since 1983, the year of the referendum. `` That means a lot of girls are n't even considering abortion but are going ahead and having the baby,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said. `` Hopefully, it will continue to drop. But <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is only 60 miles off our coast, and we'll have to keep working away.'' <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON>, clinic administrator of The <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> Well Woman Center, said the drop more likely stems in part from fewer <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> women giving <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> addresses when they have British abortions because of the controversy. The Well Woman clinic is one of two centers barred by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> from providing information on how to get abortions after the suits by the anti-abortion society. The other center closed, and Ms. <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON> said Well Woman might be forced to do the same because it has been ordered to pay the anti-abortion society's $ 60,000 legal costs. While launching a fund-raising campaign, the center last month resumed pregnancy counseling, limiting its discussion of abortion to the operation, methods, care and cost, but not giving the addresses of the English clinics. The center plans to appeal the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> by Sept. 16 on grounds it violates the right `` to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media,'' which is guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, it's not clear a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in favor of the center would change national policy. Although legalizing abortion is not an issue, a survey released last month by the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> found 58 percent of the population favored abortion if pregnancy seriously endangers a woman's life or health or results from rape or incest.

 About 15,000 animal trappers swapped tips and admired everything from raccoon fur to alligator heads at a national convention, while demonstrators Saturday marched with signs reading, `` Every Fur Coat Hurts.'' Some of the 200 animal rights activists marching outside the <ORGANIZATION> Peoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> also carried signs with a picture of a mink, reading `` This animal needs her mother. Is she on your back?'' The activists say the trappers' use of steel leg-hold traps are responsible for millions of painful animal deaths each year. `` Strong men protect and defend the innocent. Cowards trap,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Sievers </PERSON>, who represented Trans-species Unlimited. `` It's time to ban this trap,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sievers </PERSON> said during a rally in front of the Civic Center. `` You know why this is a great day? It's a great day because we've got ourselves a winnable issue,'' said <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. The protesters collected signatures to use in their effort to lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ban leg-hold traps. The trappers, meeting this weekend for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trappers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s 29th annual convention, say they are misunderstood animal lovers and blame animal rights activists for tarnishing their image. `` We love animals,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrunich </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Taylor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Trappers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Specialty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, a mail-order trapper supply company. `` We have a great deal of respect for animals. We're helping keep their numbers down and prevent overpopulation There's no logic to any of their claims. On Friday, about 400 exhibitors displayed assorted animal skins and the latest gizmos for catching wild critters. The parking lot outside resembled a giant tailgate party featuring such delicacies as <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> red peppers, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> coyote and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> alligator steaks. `` We cater gator,'' is the call from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Braxton </PERSON>'s booth. He looks like a cross between <PERSON> Grizzly </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Crocodile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> as he picks up the head of a 650-pound alligator he caught in his native <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Braxton </PERSON> and his partner are licensed alligator control agents in <LOCATION> Westville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and are hired to capture the reptiles when they pose a danger to humans. He uses their meat in his Gator Caterers business and sells gator heads _ skeletons or preserved with skin and eyes _ at prices ranging from $ 95 to $ 200. Inside the civic center exhibition hall, steel traps are available by the thousands and wire snares are common. A small dirt pond was built in one corner of the arena. An old-time trapper demonstrated the best way to conceal a small leg-old trap and fielded questions from hundreds of conventioneers on topics such as how to lure a beaver into a submerged trap. Others advertised their merchandise with videotaped in-the-field demonstrations. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Naatz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, came to the convention to sell Glaciers' Edge fox urine, at $ 12 a gallon, which he said is essential for succesful trapping. `` You spread it around your trap to kill human odors,'' said <PERSON> Naatz </PERSON>, who raises 200 foxes. `` It makes other animals think there's been a fox nearby and is a good bait.

 Concerns about violence and vandalism dissipated Saturday as the opening of the controversial film `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' passed with little trouble and more moviegoers than protesters. The movie, which opened Friday in nine major cities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, has been denounced by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> evangelists and conservative Catholics. Protesters contend that the portrayal of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in the fictional movie as a man with self-doubt and a temptation to give up his call as a savior to live as a mortal is blasphemous. Security guards and police were searching purses and guarding movie screens. There were reports of minor vandalism at the Century Plaza Cinemas in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and one arrest each in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Police in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said demonstrators have kept themselves under control. `` We're handling it as a very, very low profile situation,'' Sgt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said Saturday. `` We have one supervisor keeping a very casual eye on it.'' Police officers had patrolled Friday in the theater complex, which showed the film to near capacity crowds on two of its screens. Some movie patrons said the protesters were trying to infringe on freedom of speech and religious tolerance, while others wondered what all the fuss was about. The 800-seat Cinerama theater in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> had near capacity crowds Friday night as about 300 people demonstrated outside the theater. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the 900-seat Northpoint Theater sold out on Friday 30 minutes after the doors opened for the first show amid 100 protesters and a small band of counterprotesters. Moviegoers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION> outnumbered demonstrators six to one when the film opened at the Avalon Theater. People lined up around the block as 75 demonstrators marched in a circle jeering at those buying tickets. Officials reported that one person was arrested for crossing a police line. The Cooper Theater in the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> was more than 75 percent full for its Friday evening showing of the film as about 300 demonstrators held a peaceful prayer vigil outside. The film's showing in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> was accompanied by protests from Roman Catholics, Greek Orthodox, fundamentalists, <ORGANIZATION> Muslims </ORGANIZATION>, atheists and one neo-Nazi. A total of 600 people turned out to demonstrate at the <LOCATION> Biograph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION> _ where gangster <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillinger </PERSON> was gunned down more than a half-century ago. All four shows at the 800-seat theater were sold out Friday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, four shows sold out at the Ziegfeld Theater, which holds 1,144 people. Demonstrators, who sang, chanted and recited the Lord's Prayer, numbered about 100 people at midday but the crowd grew to between 500 and 1,000 by evening. One man who opposed the demonstrators was arrested for disorderly conduct after getting into a scuffle. The movie also is playing in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. A Universal spokesman said a decision has not yet been made whether to add other cities next week. Movie chains refusing to book the film include the <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, Mass.-based General Cinema Theaters, the nation's fourth-largest movie chain with 1,338 screens in 318 locations. Director <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> has defended his film, pointing out it is a work of fiction and is not based on the <ORGANIZATION> Gospels </ORGANIZATION>, and was not made with blasphemous intent.

The rebels initially demanded the release of five alleged communists in jail who are reportedly suffering from various illnesses, but settled for their treatment in exchange for the soldiers' freedom. Provincial officials also agreed to create a human rights task force that will monitor alleged military abuses and compensate victims, and make recruitment for vigilante groups voluntary in compliance with the rebels' other demands.

 Israeli troops fatally shot two Palestinians and wounded nine Saturday in stone-throwing incidents in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the army and hospital officials said. The latest confrontation was Saturday night in a refugee camp near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, where 18-year-old <PERSON> Yussef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Damaj </PERSON> died of a gunshot wound to the chest, the <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> daily said. Soldiers opened fire as youths hurled rocks at the troops in a clash that lasted several hours, the newspaper said. The army confirmed that a dead Palestinian was brought to a nearby hospital after a clash at the camp, but a spokesman said soldiers were investigating the cause of death. <PERSON> Damaj </PERSON>'s death raised to 242 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising in Israeli-occupied territories began Dec. 8. Four Israelis have also died. Another Palestinian, 52-year-old <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Eid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizak </PERSON>, was shot and killed earlier Saturday in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> on the Egyptian border, where Arabs hurled stones at troops during a protest, hospital officials said. The <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> demonstration was to protest the deaths of two Arab workers in a fire last week at a construction site near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. Police have said the fire appeared to be the work of arsonists but have refused to elaborate. The army confirmed the death in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> Saturday, saying troops opened fire with live ammunition after trying to quell stone-throwing protests by shooting tear gas and rubber bullets. Officials at Nasser hospital said a 15-year-old girl was among the wounded. A clash also broke out at <LOCATION> Nasser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> when protesters gathered outside and began stoning troops, who responded with gunfire. Five Palestinians were shot in the legs, hospital officials said. The army said it had no reports of casualties. The army slapped curfews on four neighborhoods of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>, located at the southern tip of the seaside <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on the Egyptian border. Soldiers also opened fire at protesters in the <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, wounding an 18-year-old in the leg, an official at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said. The army said it was investigating the report. In <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, 15 masked youths smashed every window in the three-story town hall, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported. The attack was a seen as a protest against Palestinians cooperating with the military government, the television said. In <LOCATION> Beitin </LOCATION>, an Arab alleged to have collaborated with Israeli authoriies started firing at an outlawed Palestinian flag hanging from a telephone pole, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Rafidiyeh </ORGANIZATION> and Ittihad hospitals said. When villagers rushed at the man, he turned his fire on them, wounding three, the officials said. An Arab reporter identified the alleged collaborator as <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bele </PERSON> from the village of <LOCATION> Funduq </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said he was a land dealer who was stoned by local villagers when he came to <PERSON> Beitin </PERSON>. The man fled after opening fire, the radio said. The army had no comment on the incident and police spokesman <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Fares </PERSON> said he was not authorized to discuss it. In another development, three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> garbage collectors were severely beaten by Jewish assailants while they worked in the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Givat </PERSON> <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON>, the Israeli-owned <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The assailants also attacked the Arabs' Jewish employer who rushed to the aid of his workers and smashed the windows of his truck, <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that the attack was unprovoked.

 Radical students demanding unification with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> battled riot police with firebombs and rocks Sunday. Angry residents demonstrated to demand an end to the violence. Protesters staged several attacks with firebombs to try and push back thousands of police surrounding <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the west of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Troopers in green combat fatigues and black, visored helmets fired volleys of tear gas and hurled rocks to drive students back in the third day of clashes at the school. `` Advance nation unification'' and `` <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> go home,'' students chanted. Students tried to stage a number of demonstrations in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, but the handfuls of protesters who showed up were dispersed quickly by hundreds of riot police. Angry residents and shopkeepers staged several counter-protests to demand students stop violent demonstrations. Some onlookers and passersby heckled student demonstrations. Some 3,000 students were at <LOCATION> Yonsei </LOCATION> to prepare for a march Monday to the border truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> for talks with North Korean student delegates on reuniting the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. The government banned the march and the students have virtually no chance of getting past the heavy police cordon blocking them. A similar attempt to march to the border June 10 was blocked by riot police and turnouts at the latest protests have been smaller. About 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a treaty and students contend <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> backs military rule in the country. The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War.

<HEAD>In Recent Past, When Gambling Was Illegal ... But Was Taxed Anyway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Not very long ago, this resort spa's illegal gambling was hotter than its much-touted healing spring water, so much so that local government winked and even reaped tax revenue rather than stop it Throngs of tourists and townspeople took chances, in violation of state law, on at least 350 slot machines, card games, bingo and bookmaking. Police looked the other way, except to collect the municipal `` amusement'' tax, until 1967, when a state crackdown during the administration of the late Gov. <PERSON> Winthrop </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> scrapped tons of betting devices. `` It was probably the only illegal tax in this country collected by a city,'' recalls state Sen. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> `` Bud'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, who was <LOCATION> Garland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff in 1967 but was n't invited to join state agents who raided the casinos. `` They built a city auditorium, where the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pageant </ORGANIZATION> is held _ a beautiful place _ and a city hall, and the main firehouse downtown, all on an illegal tax,'' he says. Dusty tax records show the city levied $ 10 monthly for each slot machine. The Baxter Hotel, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>'s Barbecue, <ORGANIZATION> Harlem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shack </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Eatmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cafe </ORGANIZATION> had one slot each. More adventurous were the J.D. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Fish Market, <ORGANIZATION> VFW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, with two slots apiece. The best bet at Coy's <ORGANIZATION> Steak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> these days might be the fork-tender prime cuts, but in 1967 diners waiting for a table could play eight slot machines. Tax rates ran $ 100 a month for bingo and cards, $ 500 for large casinos _ those with more than five gaming tables _ and $ 300 for small casinos. The casinos included places like the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and The Vapors. Tax rates were raised in 1964, but the <ORGANIZATION> Elks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> refused to pay the difference. Records show club officials sent payments on their five slots at the old rate until the state raids in early fall 1967. `` The cornerstone of public morality is respect for the law,'' <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> declared that year in hiring former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to be state police chief. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says he told <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> he wanted to concentrate on law enforcement, not politics, and specifically on closing casinos. He says <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> `` slapped his knee and said ` That's exactly what I want.''' Early on Aug. 17, 1967, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and about two dozen officers converged on the downtown <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. It was after normal business hours and the door was locked. The owner was summoned, according to newspaper accounts. When he did n't show after an hour, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> broke a glass panel in the door with a tire iron, in front of photographers, and troopers knocked in the door Two days later, the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> editorialized: `` <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has given the state the most convincing demonstration yet of how the state can break the back of the notorious <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> gambling operation, which has been a scandal of historic, but nonetheless disgraceful dimension ... he was following his responsibility to the law where local enforcement had defaulted.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> cried foul. `` I'm really incensed,'' the sheriff told reporters. He complained about the lack of notice to local lawmen, `` especially those who have to be elected and must answer to the people.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> responded 21 years later: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and all of the other clubs could be found by tourists who went to <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. They could have been found by a blind man. And if the sheriff did n't know they were there, then I was afraid to take him with me on a raid.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> attributes the friction to politics. `` You had a brand-new Republican governor, and you had a brand-new Democratic sheriff,'' he says. Proposals to legalize casino gambling fell twice to voter rejection, in 1964 and in 1984, and once to <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION>'s veto, in 1967.

<HEAD>Infant Slaughter-Organ Transplant Rumors Frustrate Officials</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are frustrated by persistent reports _ some blamed on <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> disinformation _ that <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children are being butchered for organ transplants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The reports have been crisscrossing the globe for the past 20 months, confounding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who have been trying to locate their genesis, track their progress and provide credible denials. The latest report surfaced last week in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, after police raided a house and found seven infants and several pregnant women who apparently planned to give their babies up for adoption. A juvenile judge, <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, said that while he had no proof, he believed some of the babies might be dismembered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for their organs, which could then be sold for hundreds of dollars. The story, circulated by a respected news agency, has been making the rounds of the world press this week despite adamant denials from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that all the reports are based on unsubstantiated rumors which began in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Its yearlong investigation _ aided by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies _ has failed to find any proof of the charges. `` The original misinformation would not have spread so far and wide if it had not been for the way it was cynically used and embellished with deliberate distortions in a disinformation campaign by several communist countries, with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> taking the lead,'' according to a report on Soviet disinformation prepared by <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharing </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees organ transplants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has also denied the charges. `` It's very frustrating when you do n't know who's spreading such rumors,'' said <PERSON> Kelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Straw </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the non-profit organization, which receives some of its funds from the government. Ms. <PERSON> Straw </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> had never found any leads to follow in its own investigation of the reports. `` And anyway, it's ridiculous,'' she said. `` Children do n't make good donors; their organs are n't fully developed.'' In its report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> cited dozens of other such reports which have surfaced in places as diverse as <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, some in <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspapers and others in independent publications. `` The rumor is gruesome enough so that it would feed on itself without any help,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON>, an agency official who prepared the report and has been monitoring the `` baby parts'' case as it is known in the government. `` But because the Soviets are involved, we're seeing more of these reports and with more of an anti-American slant,'' he added. <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where thousands of babies are adopted by foreigners every year, is a fertile ground for breeding such rumors. In its report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> concluded it is sometimes hard to tell which of the baby parts allegations are `` due to misinformation and which is due to disinformation.'' But <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> said disinformation experts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can tell whether the Soviets are behind a certain report according to the newspapers carrying such a story and the slant that it takes. In some cases, the Soviet role is quite obvious, he said. On July 25, 1987, the official Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported that an international <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> brings up disabled children in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and sends them to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There, the butcher medics cut out their hearts, kidneys and eyes,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> report said. The newspaper cited officials of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> for Children, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, as the source of its information. The organization accused Izvestia of turning out `` a veritable masterpiece: an astute mix of quotes taken out of context, journalistic comment, established fact and unfounded allegations.'' The course of the baby parts story constitutes a fascinating study in the life of a rumor. The <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> has traced the original report to <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Villeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, formerly <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' top social welfare official. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> was quoted as saying in January 1987 that he was told by some social workers several years previously about people seeking to adopt disabled children so they could sell them `` for parts'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His comments were circulated worldwide by a respected news agency, lending them sufficient credibility and exposure so that they have been cited repeatedly since then despite his retraction the day after his remarks were reported. In his retraction, <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said `` he confused a simple rumor'' with facts. Other Honduran officials denied there was any proof of such practices. But more than a year later, his comments were still circulating, and were quoted _ among other places _ in the Venezuelan newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION>. `` It just wo n't die.

 From tiny vials of `` <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s sweat'' to plans to bury <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' in the toe of a huge cowboy boot, some Southerners ai n't been whittling Dixie's icons from slabs of good taste, a trained observer says The greater the fame of the heroes, the more apt you are to find tacky items and stories twisting up around their memory like tendrils of the kudzu vine, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a professor of history and Southern studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a native Texan, has become a self-appointed keeper of what he calls the `` Southern Tacky Collection.'' Many people would say his campus office is cluttered with junk, but he views it as a display of `` material artifacts'' dating to 1950. `` This is sort of the wall of Southern culture. All sorts of posters with post cards, pictures, images of the South. Post cards often portray these icons of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, motioning to hundreds of cards papering his office wall and sitting in stacks on his desk. `` This one is my all-time favorite. ... It has a small vial of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>' sweat. ` The King lives. His perspiration will be your inspiration,' it says. `` Here's Presley's Cadillac. This is a real icon. There's all kinds of stories about Presley driving around in his Cadillac. He gave Cadillacs as gifts.'' Though prized, nothing in <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s collection is priceless. Rather, they are generally cheap. `` These are not necessarily things that stand out for uniqueness but things that are representative,'' he said. `` They are such simple items; they're not the kind of things anybody saves.'' Every region has its mass-produced tacky items, but <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> contends some pieces are `` uniquely Southern.'' `` A lot of the things I collect are symbols,'' he said. `` A cotton bale for example. In <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> if you go to <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON>'s or various stores they sell little cotton bales as souvenirs as a symbol of the South. That's marketing a symbol of the South.'' Other miscellaneous tacky stuff in the collection ranges from pop-up cardboard antebellum homes to a stuffed armadillo and plastic cows that moo when their heads are twisted. A big category in his collection is fans, primarily stamped with images of a happy family or pastoral theme. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said funeral homes most often produced and gave away the fans, which were used extensively before air-conditioning. Another favorite item is an inexpensive clock with wooden extensions on the sides. Photographs, apparently torn from magazines, of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and his wife, Coretta, and President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> are glued on each side. `` It looks almost like an icon in a Catholic church in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or something, with wooden panels and then the Saints,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. His collection also includes advertisements and wrappers from Southern sweets like <ORGANIZATION> Goo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clusters </ORGANIZATION> and Moon Pies. Another facet of his work examines Southern `` yard art'' like plastic pink flamingos. `` Exactly when and how it developed, I'm still trying to find out But you do n't find this in places other than the South,'' he said. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also collects tacky tales of the modern South. His favorite is a proposal by some members of the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, shortly after the death of country singer <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> in 1953, to construct a monument to him in the shape of a cowboy boot. `` It was going to be a huge, towering monument with his body buried in the toe part,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> chuckled. `` It was a pretty wild idea all right. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> actually debated it.'' The idea eventually was tossed out.

 Communist guerrillas released four army officers and an enlisted man in this coconut farming village Sunday after holding them hostage in the mountains for more than two months. In another development, machete-wielding assailants hacked to death 14 villagers, including three children, near the central city of <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosal </PERSON>, spokesman for the communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, unlocked the chains from the five prisoners' wrists in front of 170 journalists, relatives and officials waiting near a coconut grove. On June 1, the rebels captured Lts. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Casis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clarito </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Rommel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salamanca </LOCATION> and constabulatory Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> in this village about 70 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> province. The five men, dressed in civilian clothes, were driving toward <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> when they were abducted by rebels they thought were government troops, according to Col. <PERSON> Hernani </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, a military spokesman. Rebels often wear uniforms similar to army fatigues. The military and the rebels agreed to a temporary cease-fire that ends at noon Tuesday. Provincial officials in <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> assured the rebels they will not force people to join government paramilitary units. Authorities also agreed to create a committee to investigate alleged human rights abuses by government soldiers and to pay damages to victims. Twelve suspected communists, including a 71-year-old woman, were arrested in a raid in <LOCATION> Kilawis </LOCATION> village on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, according to Sgt. <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Artajos </PERSON>. Firearms and documents were seized along with the suspects, who were accused of recruiting members for the communist insurgency, <PERSON> Artajos </PERSON> said. The official <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the military on the central island of <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION> detained five suspected rebels in connection with the slaying of an Australian businessmen in the province on Monday. The police chief in <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION>, Maj. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardillon </PERSON>, said six assailants, some wearing masks, attacked members of two families living in shanties along an abandoned golf course in the village of <LOCATION> Cabalawan </LOCATION>, about 350 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Maj. <PERSON> Bardillon </PERSON> said only five children survived the massacre shortly after midnight Saturday and that police were searching for the attackers in the forests around the village. He said the motive for the attack apparently was revenge over a personal grudge and that one of the survivors identified three of the killers as enemies of some of the victims.

 A family tried to compensate the relatives of a man who was killed by turning over money, livestock and their 6-year-old daughter, but police intervened to stop the deal, it was reported Sunday. The compensation agreement was made between two families living near the town of <LOCATION> Murehwa </LOCATION>, 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, the Sunday Mail said. The newspaper said police ordered the family blamed for the slaying of villager <PERSON> Cyprian </PERSON> <PERSON> Nhamburo </PERSON> to exclude the child from the compensation deal. Nhamburo's relatives also demanded $ 1,620, 11 cattle and three goats from the family of a man they allege killed Nhamburo two weeks ago, the Sunday Mail said. That part of the deal was allowed. In <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, relatives often claim compensation for family deaths, but this was the first reported case involving a child in the transaction. The <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> condemned the deal as `` tantamount to slave trading'' and said it would take legal action to ban tribal practices it said `` reduce a human being to the level of a commodity exchange.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is playing the vice president gambit for everything it's worth, which is n't very much. But then, it's the only bit of show business available this week at the Republican National Convention. His orchestrated surprise will be good theater for a few hours in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. And, obviously, the Republican presidential nominee's choice of a running mate is a crucial decision in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> bid to keep the White House. But nobody is going to remember the theatrics once they are done. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan is to announce the selection on Thursday morning, with tight secrecy until then. Campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said there'll be `` as much drama as we can have,'' the better to boost interest and television ratings. `` I'm for doing anything that will help build up a TV audience,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` There wo n't be any leaks of this one because I'm not gon na tell a soul,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Some souls may think there are clues, however. Take Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, who telephoned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday and asked not be considered for second spot on the ticket. Such requests often come from people who figure they are n't going to be chosen anyhow Having been there, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knows the way the game is played. For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, there was a hotel suite across the street from the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> convention hall in which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was nominated in 1980. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a defeated rival for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination that year, waited out a very long night of speculation that former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> would be the vice presidential nominee on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ticket. It was going on midnight when that deal fell apart, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. A quick telephone call, a quick acceptance, a joint appearance before the convention to quell the chaos and introduce the running mate. Now it is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s turn to issue the summons. His presidential nomination is set, the vice presidency is the only unfilled role. Actually, what he is doing is choosing his candidate the old-fashioned way. Until relatively recent conventions, presidential nominees observed strict vows of silence on the vice presidency until after their own nominations. Advance discussion was presumptuous, gauche. On Wednesday night of convention week, after the roll call that delivered the nomination, the presidential nominee would summon his high command into late-night session to settle on No. 2. Prospects would come and go from the candidate's suite. In 1964, President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> chose Sen. <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> for his ticket, but summoned <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, too, just to keep people guessing. Latter-day candidates have taken to listing prospects in advance and, in some cases, to conducting pre-convention job interviews. They send out questionnaires, they look at fitness reports. That practice took on some urgency after the 1972 Democratic convention, at which nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> chose Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> to run with him, and learned after the fact that <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> had been hospitalized for nervous exhaustion and fatigue, and had undergone electric shock treatments. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> replaced him on the ticket, which went down in flames, and presidential nominees have tended to conduct more thorough advance checks on prospective running mates ever since. In 1976, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> interviewed seven prospects, then chose <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> for vice president. When his turn came, <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> conducted a similar set of pre-convention auditions and chose Rep. <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> interviewed a half-dozen prospects, then chose <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> a week before the national convention that nominated that ticket in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. In the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selection game, a dozen names have floated into speculation encouraged by campaign stage managers. Two governors, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> said they do not want to be considered, as did Sens. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. `` I would be a liability,'' protests Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> cited family concerns. He said he'd have to travel too much, and his wife could n't come because they have a 10-year-old in school. At face value, that would make him the first politician to shrink from seeking national office for want of a sitter. If they wo n't run, others will. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said he'd be glad to accept. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> said it would be an honor. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said he was n't too proud to campaign a little for it. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> says he does n't want the job, but it would be arrogant to turn it down. Mark them down for honest men. The fact of the matter is that there are n't many Republican politicians who would say no if asked.

<HEAD>Superman And At Least Four Chinese Films Stopped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leading newspaper on Sunday criticized officials for banning `` Superman'' and at least four Chinese films that passed the censors and opened to packed movie houses. In a rare plea from the official press, the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> called for measures to prevent such `` lawlessness.'' The report said `` Superman'' was one of at least five movies banned in the capital since 1985. It said unidentified officials decided the films were unfit for the masses. The officials had showings of `` Superman'' halted in early 1986 because they said the movie `` turned the world upside down'' and `` reversed the flow of time,'' according to the report. The officials did not want <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` youth to be inculcated with the film's impossible idealism,'' the report said. In the 1978 movie, <PERSON> Superman </PERSON> rescues <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> from death in an earthquake by circling the earth at the speed of light and reversing time. Two of the other films that were banned in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, `` The Fierce Battle in <LOCATION> Taierzhuang </LOCATION>'' and `` The Beach'' have won awards in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The controversial `` <LOCATION> Taierzhuang </LOCATION>'' depicts a battle between the Kuomintang, archrival to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and Japanese invaders in 1938. In the movie, the Kuomintang, who were forced out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1949 and now occupy <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, are depicted as patriotic and even heroic, an image which clashes sharply with the one created by the Communist government. The report said that in April 1987 when `` <LOCATION> Taierzhuang </LOCATION>'' was playing across the nation, officials closed the film in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. After eight months of agitation in the movie industry, the report said, the government let the film show in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but only for six months and no advertising was allowed. At the end of 1985, the report said, `` The Beach,'' a explicit love story, was suddenly pulled from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> movie theaters even after official censors approved it. The paper said `` certain leaders thought the plot would have a bad affect on society.'' In the film, a woman is forced by her family into an arranged marriage. The scene of her wedding night portrays the tribulations of an unwilling bride in bed with her husband. The paper said that in many cases, the officials banning the films had no relation to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for censorship. It did not say what department of government the officials were from. The report also said that since 1984 <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has only allowed two copies each of popular martial arts movies to circulate in the capital's movie theaters, while other cities had 10 copies. `` This regulation might be a good one in order to limit the influence these movies have one young people,'' the paper said. `` But because there's no law to follow, who knows whether it's true. The report said banning movies after they have already been released has cost <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s theaters thousands of dollars. It also said officials who like unpopular movies have forced city film officials to order more copies of them, causing further losses. The report called for a law that would set clear regulations on the content of movies to counteract official capriciousness. A recent issue of Outlook magazine said officials at the Ministry of Culture are studying a proposed law setting censorship guidelines for movies. Among the topics being debated, the magazine said, is whether naked bodies or serious crimes should be depicted on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s silver screen. The proposal would mark the first time since Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was established in 1949 that explicit standards have been set about what can and can not be included in a Chinese movie.

 Rep. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a frizzy-haired, bow-tied magician who is retiring after 24 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, wants to be remembered as the Prince of Pork who brought billions in federal projects to his depressed district. But he's still trying to live down a reputation as the man who brought <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It's a bum rap,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> says of allegations that he had a personal relationship with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, the `` I-can ` t-type'' secretary who claimed she was on a committee payroll only to provide sex for the chairman, then-Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> `` I hired her in 1972, fired her in'73 and she did n't even meet <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> until 1976,'' said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, an Illinois Democrat. `` I never had anything to do with <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> personally. I'm no angel and do n't profess to be. People can say lots of things about me, and they do, but that's one thing I was not guilty of.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, 63, is guilty of wearing loud clothes, driving big cars and delivering by his own estimate about $ 7 billion worth of federal projects to his coal-mining district in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` I've always been called the Prince of Pork, and I wear that label proudly,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` It means we got 500 miles of Interstate highway, modern concrete roads, water and sewer and lights _ all things we needed in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. We tried to build the infrastructure needed for local communities to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.'' Citing poor health, he announced last November that he will retire at year end after 12 terms that spanned 34 years. `` It was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made,'' he said. `` To walk away from this kind of power, which gives you the vehicle to help other people, is a tremendously regretful situation.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> has served on the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> during his tenure and wields considerable clout through his seniority and friendship with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership, particularly with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who often assigns <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to preside over the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, cautions against judging <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> by his flamboyant dress and jocular nature. `` The more you know him,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says, `` the more convinced you become of his having a first-rate mind, a sincere purpose and the capacity to perform effectively.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said his retirement plans are sketchy at the moment. `` I've got a motor home, and I want to putter around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and see a lot of places I have n't been,'' he said `` But who knows? I may get tired of it and want to get back into government. `` One thing is definite. I intend to become very active in feeding children and hungry people.'' A coal miner's son and amateur magician who spent his early years as a car dealer, airport operator and auctioneer, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> became known for showmanship and his down-home style when he arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He often used magic tricks to illustrate his speeches, which he peppered with such folksy phrases as: `` When I meet somebody, I shake their hand twice'' and `` times are so bad down in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> that the creeks are only running three days a week.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> also developed an image that haunts him today: a reputation for flashy clothes, fancy cars and late-night parties. Velvet suits have given way to double-breasted sport coats and bow ties, and <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> describes his lifestyle as quiet today _ an impression shared by friends. `` It could be said we all mellow with age,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, a Republican from <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` He is a different person, although <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> was always a very popular figure even during his early days.'' `` I'd like to be remembered for helping people with all those things,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` But I'll be happy if they just remember me.''

Each night of the four-day convention, opening Monday, will be devoted to broad themes, such as the successes of the Reagan-Bush years, the issues and ideas of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the differences between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will kick off the process with a prime-time address Monday night. The president will `` lay out the record of the last seven years, and there's not a better man in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to do that than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' said campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. `` The second night you will see a lot of comparative speeches, you will see comparative differences on quite a few vital issues,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. Among others, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> will attempt to debunk what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> calls the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle'' of economic recovery, while former presidential hopeful <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> will talk about values. `` The third and fourth nights will be devoted to two things: No. 1 pointing out <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s qualifications, pointing out what he has done with his life and why he is the best qualified man to be president and lastly, of course, Thursday night he will be front and center talking about where he wants to take country and what he believes in ... This will really be his first time in front of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people front and center stage like this,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff says there will be a clear distinction between the Republican convention and last month's Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokeswoman, said, `` It will be very issue-specific. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said many times this is not going to be negative. `` It's not going to be a series of one-liners like you heard in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' she said, referring to taunts that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` born with a silver foot in his mouth'' and was `` a toothache of a man.'' Referring to the Democratic convention, she said, `` I think it was a little bit offensive to people watching it on television. People want to be informed on issues. It's not like tuning in -LRB- comedian -RRB- <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>.'' To underscore the daily message, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders will hold news conferences each day. Each news conference will feature two speakers, a political person such as <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and an issues expert prepared to deal in depth with a particular subject. To further cement the message, the campaign has assembled 10 caucus teams that, over the course of the week, will visit each of the 54 delegations. Each caucus team will include a member of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s family, a Cabinet member, a campaign official, an elected official and a celebrity of some fashion. Ms. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> described the overall operation as one that was `` blanketing the city. They're all hearing the same three messages'' of the Reagan-Bush record, the issues of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his differences with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellou-Vogel </PERSON> whipped up the troops one more time. `` We're party animals! Right?'' he yelled. `` Right!'' the 50 greeters lined up at gate 15-D in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> screamed back. `` What did you say?'' `` Right!'' they yelled even louder. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 4082 from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> had not even finished rolling up to the gate when <PERSON> Castellou-Vogel </PERSON> started his charges clapping. `` Play some music,'' he shouted to the Onward Brass Band. `` Let's boogie!'' The plangent sounds reached the passengers even before they made their way up the ramp and caught sight of the cheering, clapping, sign-waving throng decked out in red, white and blue to greet them. The exuberant cheers grew even louder for those who arrived in this reknowned party town sporting Republican paraphernalia, like the woman who deplaned from <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> with two stuffed elephants grazing atop her straw hat. `` It's all part of our effort to let people know <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is a friendly city and that we want them here,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarrubia </PERSON>, assistant director of airport operations for the Republican National Convention. Volunteer greeters, 700 of them, were trained to give a rousing welcome to the delegates, politicians, V.I.P.s, and assorted <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> conventioneers arriving at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The greeters began patrolling the two airport concourses Aug. 5 and will keep rolling out the red carpet through Aug. 20. From 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., they cheer, clap, call out greetings and blow kisses at those arriving. Although they're there to greet those attending the Republican National Convention, everyone on the plane gets the same welcome. `` It was wonderful,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Setar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, whose husband came to play in a convention orchestra. `` I did n't know what to think. I looked around thinking someone famous must be arriving, but they were doing it for all of us. I think its marvelous, just the kind of thing you expect from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, agreed. `` It's absolutely wonderful. You come off the plane after a long trip and sometihing like this really pumps you up.'' For the greeters, seeing the reaction of the people arriving is just part of the fun. `` It's kind of like a surprise birthday party,'' said <PERSON> Amie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 13, as she prepared to meet another plane. `` I'm hoping to see someone famous before we finish, but I greet everyone the same way, even if they're not a celebrity.'' In fact, the greeters said Saturday, spotting the real celebrities arriving for the convention is tough. `` We saw <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> today. She had on big sunglasses, but my friend recognized her,'' <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> is convinced that one television anchorman slipped past incognito. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> wore a disguise when he came through,'' the greeter said. `` I talked to some people who saw him. They said he had on a false moustache, dark glasses and a baseball cap.''

<HEAD>Barbara Bush Won't Turn into `Glamorous Princess'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is loyal to a fault but she says she wo n't `` turn into a glamorous princess'' just because her husband in running for president. `` What you see with me is what you get. I'm not running for president _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is,'' says the snowy-haired wife of the certain Republican nominee. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says she is eager to get out on the campaign trail for the man she `` absolutely adores'' and that she intends to tell voters about his strength, courage and ability to get things done. But her loyalty to her husband of 43 years has its price. Calling herself the `` world's worst secret keeper,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said she has asked her husband not tell her about his choice for a running mate. `` I've kept secrets, but it's agony,'' she said. `` This time, I want to be surprised.'' At ease with reporters _ and lauded by many for her kindnesses to them _ staffers on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign refer to Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as their `` secret weapon.'' But her quick wit and eagerness to chat got her into trouble four years ago _ when she was quoted by reporters as saying of <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, the 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee, `` that $ 4 million _ I ca n't say it, but it rhymes with rich.'' `` It was dumb of me, I should n't have said it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says now, insisting she holds no grudge against the reporters. `` I blame <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. It was not attractive and I've been very shamed. I apologized to Mrs. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> and I would apologize again.'' But unable to resist another quip, she adds, `` I'm not making poems anymore.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> admits feeling a bit envious of <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the wife of Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` She's so attractive,'' the vice president's wife confides, dropping her voice to a near-conspiratorial whisper. `` I'd love to look like her if you want to know the truth.'' At 63, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a year younger than her husband <PERSON> George </PERSON> and two years younger than the perfectly coiffed and designer-dressed <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But there will be no apologies here, thank you very much, for the creamy complexion adorned with multiple `` laugh lines'' or the curved figure that's more at home in silky afternoon dresses _ or well-worn jeans _ than state dinner decolletage. `` I'm not going to turn into a glamorous princess,'' she says of her campaign role. Well aware of the criticism heaped on Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for her high-priced tastes, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says there's more to the race than hair styles or designer frocks. `` I'm not going to worry about it. I have plenty of self-confidence, not in how I look but in how I feel, and I feel good about my husband, my children and my life,'' she said. That security has been gleaned during a life begun in what many would consider affluence, as the daughter of the publisher of <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>'s magazine. But it has been tested during the years by the ups and downs of her husband's career, and such personal loss as the death of a daughter to leukemia. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> exudes serenity as she, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and their five children enter the formal campaign to replace the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> at 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Ave. It could well be their 29th residence. Since the 19-year-old sophomore from <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> married the tall and lanky <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> flier on Jan. 6, 1945, in her hometown of Rye, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, they've moved more than two dozen times. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have been called home _ all during <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s odyssey from military man to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> graduate to oil man to politician. Although her speech is marked by the well-mannered tones of the blueblood background she shares with husband, she can be imperious when he is criticized. Asked about the `` wimp'' image that's plagued her husband, she sniffs, `` That's just what the Democrats say.'' And when queried about the fact that polls indicate that fewer women prefer her husband to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, she retorts: `` I'm slightly offended as a woman when I hear <PERSON> George </PERSON> has this enormous gender gap,'' she said. She puts the onus on the party, not her man. `` I think the Republicans have a gender gap, not <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' she says. Over the coming months, she'll campaign about 60 percent of the time on her own, the rest with her husband, talking about the things she `` knows best'' _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and her years-long fight to battle illiteracy. She contends her husband is `` perfectly willing'' to let others take the credit for things he's done. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a fellow who believes in quiet leadership. You do n't have to blow you own horn,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` That's probably why our relationship is so good _ he lets me think I think all the good things up.''

 <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the imprisoned South African black leader, has shown noticeable improvement since he was admitted to the hospital for a lung ailment, a doctor said Sunday. Dr. J.G. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, medical superintendent at <LOCATION> Tygerberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said a biopsy performed on tissue from <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s lungs shows `` no evidence of malignancy, only a chronic inflammatory condition of -LRB- the lining -RRB-.''

His wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, and youngest daughter, <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON>, visited him on Saturday, <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said. `` Mandela is responding to treatment.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is spending his four-month prison term for selling cocaine in a $ 1,500-a-month luxury apartment in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> with maid service, cable TV and privileges at the <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> next door. The son of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> is staying in one of 12 units in a building designed for expense-account business people on short assignments in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION> `` We like to think of it as a cross between an apartment and a hotel, with the advantages of both,'' a spokeswoman for the building's owners said, according to a story in Sunday's editions of the New York Daily News. <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, took a dimmer view. `` This guy is a drug felon and he's living in conditions that 99.9 percent of the people of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> could n't afford. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, 24, was convicted in April of selling a quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover police officer while a student at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> sentenced him to one-to-five years in prison, with all but four months suspended. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was determined eligible for the state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s `` house arrest'' program, under which non-violent convicts can find their own housing and live under what is said to be close supervision by corrections officials. `` The department does n't provide the apartment,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, director of planning for corrections. `` The prisoner does that. We are only concerned that it meets minimum standards _ no drugs, no guns, no college kids hanging around. `` Obviously, some people Mr. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> among them, have more money than others, and they can afford a better place. The <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> probably would n't think much of his apartment. It's a matter of standards of living. And we are not paying for it so we ca n't decide a place is too luxurious if it meets the other criteria. Corrections officials did say there was concern, however, that dissatisfaction in the law enforcement community with the comfortable way in which <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> is serving time may threaten the future of the house arrest program. `` It's a disgrace to put a drug dealer into the program,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. `` I'm not happy about it and neither are other state's attorneys.

<HEAD>Many GOP Delegates Gainsay Gender GAP</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many delegates to the Republican National Convention believe the `` gender gap'' is a fallacy despite recent polls showing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lagging in efforts to win over women voters. Thirty-seven percent of the 1,215 delegates surveyed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said the gender gap _ the voting patterns of women compared to men _ is not a problem for the certain <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee. Some delegates believe the Republican party does have a problem with women voters, but doubt it will have a big impact on the general election. Others dismiss the gender gap as a figment of the media's imagination. `` I think he should stay just where he is,'' said <PERSON> Marylin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` I think the gender gap is a creation of the media. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had a ` gender gap' and he carried 49 of 50 states in the 1984 election.'' `` I do n't think it has anything to do with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. It has to do with Democrats vs. Republicans,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Walpole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman. `` If women understood, they would realize the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is genuinely compassionate.'' `` That was also true prior to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s general election and it evened out,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` This gender gap is idiotic,'' said <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` Only the media thinks there is one.'' Of the delegates surveyed, 452 said changes by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to attract women voters were unnecessary, including 144 delegates who described the gender gap as `` no problem.'' The latest <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted Aug. 5-8 and released Thursday showed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holding a 53-31 lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among women voters. `` Women have been supporters of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from the early days because <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is handsome, cordial and honest,'' said <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsht </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bellaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know who these women could be unless they belong to some very extremist groups.'' However, 25 percent of the delegates surveyed _ 301 of the 1,215 _ said the vice president should stress where he stands on issues of concern to women, including federal day care programs, equal rights and pay, abortion and education, to counter the gender gap. A total of 2,277 delegates will attend the Republican National Convention next week. `` He should come forward more on women's issues,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION> `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is perceived to be weak on women's issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will pay the price for that.'' `` He has ... to express his sensitivity to problems facing women such as single parenthood, lack of child support,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Owasso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> `` He must present some ideas of his own on how ... -LRB- to -RRB- eliminate some of these problems.'' Some delegates believe that if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> explains his stand, the gender gap will disappear. `` When women find out about his programs, there will be a different attitude,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckerich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` He's a strong advocate for women in the work force. Once you see the real <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> come out, you'll see the opinion polls change fast.'' Thirteen percent, or 160, of the delegates surveyed believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should appoint women to high-ranking posts in his campaign and Cabinet. Ten percent of the delegates polled _ 122 _ suggested a female vice-presidential candidate, frequently mentioning former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>. Other delegates believe the vice president needs to work on the image he projects. `` I think he should go to women's groups and show his twinkling blue eyes,'' said <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION> `` Just become a better actor _ I think that impresses them,'' said <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Centralia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` I think he needs a stronger stance,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nacogdoches </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` He's not a cowboy or a macho-man type which I think the females prefer.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and mother of Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>, suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` kiss more babies.'' Ten delegates said it was important for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, to get out on the campaign trail. `` She's his biggest asset as far as women are concerned,'' said <PERSON> Bev </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammerstrom </PERSON> of Temperance, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Maio </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Itasca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was hard-pressed to advise <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I have n't the vaguest idea what makes the woman voter's mind tick,'' he said.

<HEAD>Orchestra To Play Fragment Of Beethoven's 10th Symphony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The only surviving movement of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s 10th symphony, which he was writing while on his deathbed in 1827, will be played in public for the first time at a concert in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Oct. 18. The Sunday Times said the movement has been `` painstakingly and brilliantly reconstructed'' from fragments of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s original manuscripts by Dr. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a lecturer in music at <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, conducted by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Weller </PERSON>, will perform the symphony's first movement at Royal Festival Hall, a spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> had promised the 10th symphony to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> audiences eight days before his death and had assured a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> friend that sketches of the new work were `` already in my desk,'' the Sunday Times said. But the paper said posthumous researchers failed to find any retrievable music among <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s possessions. Biographers disregarded an account by his secretary, <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Holz </PERSON>, who said the composer sat at the piano and played him the opening of the 10th symphony. Five years ago, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was doing research in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> library and found a set of sketches that matched <PERSON> Holz </PERSON>'s reminiscences of the opening movement. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s belief that these were from the missing 10th symphony was reinforced by the discovery of additional sketches in the Beethoven archive in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the paper said. `` By combining the two sets,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was quoted as saying, `` I began to find what <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> had in mind for the first movement. I tried to keep very close to the sketches, to reconstruct the movement as <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> envisaged it at that time. `` I had to fill in some harmonies and compose myself a few linking sections but I did not invent any new themes. Those are all <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s,'' he was quoted as saying. The Sunday Times said none of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s scraps of notes contained more than 20 bars, just a few seconds of music. But the paper said that by laying the scraps end to end, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> assembled an entire movement lasting almost 14 minutes. While <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Ninth Symphony `` shocked contemporary listeners with its unprecedented choral finale,'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said that the first movement of the 10th symphony `` threatens to dissolve the traditional barriers between movements, inventing a more fluid structure for the symphony.''

 It's not part of <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Justensen </PERSON>'s job to knock on neighborhood doors asking about jewelry, nor is he paid to visit jewelers to find out the worth of a diamond ring. But <PERSON> Justensen </PERSON>, 24, who works for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sewer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, did both last month after finding a gold ring graced with 18 diamonds. `` I thought it was fake at first,'' he said. `` Then I saw the ` 14K' on the band and I thought I better find out for sure.'' <PERSON> Justensen </PERSON> found the ring after he and other workers did a routine cleaning of a section of sewer line that serves Angel Street in <LOCATION> Kaysville </LOCATION>. `` I saw the band stuck into the grit, so I pulled it out and we cleaned it off,'' he said. The ring was found on a Friday, and over the weekend <PERSON> Justensen </PERSON> had it appraised by two jewelers who estimated its worth at $ 800 to $ 1,200. `` I had to sit down, I was so shocked,'' he said. `` I just figured if I'd lost something like that, I'd be excited to have it back.'' The next Monday, he returned to <LOCATION> Angel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> and finally ended up on <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s doorstep. `` Right on the spot, when asked from out of the blue, I could n't think about it,'' she said But then, she said, `` It dawned on me. I wear a pendant just like it and I showed it to him _ it was from a set my husband gave me years ago. `` It was just like a dream,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said. `` You know, I had gotten to the point where I did n't expect to see it again, and I had kind of grieved over that ring.'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said it was n't just the discovery that stunned her, but <PERSON> Justensen </PERSON>'s honesty. `` In this age, you just do n't see that many examples of it,'' she said. `` It's a wonderful thing to know we have people like this in the world.''

 Anti-government groups in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> called for nationwide protests on Monday to demand that the ousted president be tried in court and that political prisoners be released, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION>, in a report Sunday from the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, said the groups also demanded compensation for families of those killed in massive anti-government riots last week. Diplomats contacted in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said they saw leaflets calling for more demonstrations but they could not confirm that the protests were called specifically for Monday. On Friday, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned as president and head of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s only party after four days of street riots that by official count killed at least 95 people Unconfirmed reports say hundreds of people were killed. No new party leader or president has been named. The state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said security forces Sunday entered the suburb of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okkalapa </LOCATION>, a site of fierce fighting between troops and anti-government protesters last week. The radio said the forces entered to `` maintain law and order'' at the request of <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and residents. But the broadcast added that barricades were removed, bus services resumed and the army donated 25 tons of rice to residents. Diplomats and returning tourists said downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> was calm over the weekend. `` There's definitely an appearance of returning to normality,'' one Western diplomat said. `` The real test will be how many people come back to their offices Monday.'' The broadcast said markets opened and buses resumed operation Sunday in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s second largest city and another scene of massive protests. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, called `` <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'' by one demonstrator, was widely hated for brutally crushing dissent during his 17 days in power and during 26 years of authoritarian rule by his predecessor, Ne Win. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> last month replaced Ne Win as chairman of the country's single political party, the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Ne Win had ruled since leading a 1962 military coup that ended <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> democracy. On July 30, authorities arrested the government's leading critic, Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, along with others accused of `` anti-state activities.'' Also arrested was Sein Win, the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> correspondent of The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In a document circulated to diplomats last week, protesters also demanded a referendum on a multi-party political system, an end to martial law, freedom for dissidents and student protesters and reductions in the cost of living. It was not known how much support the students would receive from other groups for another round of demonstrations. State workers, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and teen-agers were among the tens of thousands who rallied in 25 cities. The government has attempted to use the powerful <PERSON> Buddhist </PERSON> clergy to call for peace. Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said authorities Sunday met with <PERSON> Islamic </PERSON> leaders who issued `` a request to the faithful for peace and tranquillity and rule of law.'' Moslems make up less than 5 percent of the population. In Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Bangkok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, two travelers who just arrived from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> wrote that <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s resignation reinforced the protesters' determination to press for elimination of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have cut one head off a many-headed serpent,'' they quoted one protester as saying. `` The others remain. They all have to go.'' In another article Sunday, the newspaper quoted Thai Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> as denying rumors that <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> sought refuge in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The rumors began Friday after a man described as <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s industry minister left <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> for a flight to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Officials contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said they had no information on <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> seeking refuge there. Burmese have been angered by the country's mounting economic problems, including rampant inflation and food shortages. Under Ne Win's isolationist policies, one of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s wealthiest nations became one of its poorest, with an annual per capita income of less than $ 200 In neighboring <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, at least 500 students marched through the capital of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> Saturday to support the Burmese riots and demand <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> release the AP correspondent, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, and other political prisoners.

 A wild duck nicknamed `` Donald'' who waddled around for three months with a dart stuck in its neck while eluding would-be rescuers was finally nabbed with a little corn and twine and a lot of patience. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON>'s trapping efforts paid off Saturday, and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> spent the weekend in a cage in <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON>'s kitchen before heading to the veterinarian's office Monday to have the dart removed. Back in May, someone shot darts at the ducks that congregate along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in this central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> city. One of the 5-inch darts stuck in <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>'s upper neck. Other neighborhood folks had tried to capture the duck, a mallard. But nets scared him, and he was too quick to grab. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> had no idea he was destined for the veterinarian and not the frying pan. <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON>'s approach was to use a chicken-wire trap. He'd head down to the river at 5:30 a.m. each day, set the trap with corn and run a piece of twine from the trapdoor to his car. He'd sit there until 6:45 a.m., waiting for <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> to waddle into the trap. It never happened _ until Saturday. `` It was just like deer hunting,'' <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON> said. `` Sooner or later he was going to step in there.''

 Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> expressed little enthusiasm Sunday for <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s last-minute order to have independent counsels investigate wrongdoing in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and said he saw only `` a very limited role'' for such special prosecutors. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s final act Friday as attorney general was to sign an order for special prosecutors to investigate criminal allegations against members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Democratic lawmakers called it the vindictive act of a man who had himself been investigated by two such prosecutors. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he had discussed the order with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and added, `` I believe he agrees with it.'' But <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, questioned on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation,'' declined to say whether he would go along with the order. `` I have n't had an opportunity to review the order,'' he said from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, adding: `` I think there should be a very limited role for so-called special prosecutors or independent counsels.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> governor, headed the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division during the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration in the mid-1970s and established the public integrity section that prosecutes corrupt public officials. He said the public integrity office has `` done a first-class job'' in tracking down official corruption _ `` federal, state or local, wherever it may be.'' `` Obviously, the attorney general who preceded me had some reason for enunciating this order and I want to take a look at that and give it due consideration. But the fact of the matter is that if the evidence is there, investigations and prosecutions will be undertaken against anyone who violates the federal criminal laws, be they congressmen or ordinary citizens,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The new attorney general said he was aware of `` conflicting reports about the state of morale and commitment within the department,'' an apparent reference to the furor caused by the resignation of top officials during the waning days of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s tenure <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he had not discussed with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> whether he would stay on if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is elected president. `` I regard this as a job I'm going to do one day at a time,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. He also called `` very flattering'' speculation that he is in the running for the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket but added: `` I have a job to do for this president and unless I've heard anything from the vice president, I'm ready to go to work as attorney general of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, 56, took office as the 76th attorney general Friday, succeeding <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who resigned after saying he had been vindicated by an independent counsel investigation of his affairs. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` probably'' broke the law but decided not to seek his indictment. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> denied any improprieties and maintained that the department was running normally despite defections by top aides during his final months as attorney general.

<HEAD>Twelve Arrests At Park Demonstration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A dozen people were arrested early Sunday after a day of peaceful protests and music in a park where police and civilians met in a violent, bloody confrontation one week earlier. More than 50 people were injured in the <LOCATION> Tompkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> battle last weekend, 14 of them police officers, and nearly 100 charges of police brutality were filed. Sunday's arrests at the park in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> came when a handful of demonstrators turned rowdy several hours after Saturday's demonstrations and rallies, staged to protest the earlier alleged police violence. Most of those arrested Sunday were charged with assault, inciting to riot, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, police said. Four men were charged with attempted burglary after they tried to break through the polished glass and brass front doors of an expensive condominium building on one side of the park. The building, a target in last week's demonstrations, has come to symbolize gentrification and unwanted change for many protesters who feel they are being forced out of the neighborhood, an ethnic melting pot for generations of immigrants, by high rents and real-estate speculators. After the music ended late Saturday, about 150 chanting protesters, accompanied by 90 police officers, marched across the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. They were barred from entering the park by more officers and police barricades. The protesters then paraded twice around the park and returned to <LOCATION> Tompkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> shortly after midnight. As the night wore on, a few of the protesters became disorderly, sparking the arrests, the police said.

 A locomotive rammed four train cars into the back of a stationary train early Sunday morning during a coupling maneuver, and police said about 100 passengers were injured.

<HEAD>Tap Dance: Bush Moves Out of Reagan's Shadow, Capitalizes on His

<TEXT>
 As <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> approaches the high noon of his quest for the Republican presidential nomination, he is striving to move out of the shadow cast by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> while seeking to capitalize on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s enormous popularity. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s shadow has already shortened for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. These days he is seldom dogged with questions about distancing himself from the president. Instead, the questions now center on whether his candidacy is exerting too much influence over the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in recent days have fended off suggestions that some presidential decisions have been motivated by an effort to help the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. And confronted with public opinion polls showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> far behind among Democrats who voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers have now switched strategy to make sure that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> shadow does n't disappear altogether After first planning no contact at the Republican National Convention between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his vice president, a joint rally is now scheduled for Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. It follows an upbeat joint appearance between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a rally last Friday for senior administration officials at the Old Executive Office Building, during which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lavished praise on his vice president. If all goes as planned, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transformation into his own man will be complete when he accepts the Republican presidential nomination Thursday night at the Republican National Convention, according to aides and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultants. By the end of the convention, `` all the emphasis is going to be on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his vice presidential nominee,'' said his chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has made a conscious decision for seven years to be secondary to the president.'' `` And now that he's running for the president himself, he's talking about how he feels, what he believes in, and where he wants to take the country,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said To be sure, there are some areas in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not want to put much light between himself and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ largely the current economic expansion, now in a peacetime record of 69 months, and the fact that most of the world is at peace. The vice president has been inching away from his close identification with administration policies since he and aides huddled for a week in late May at his vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. The consensus from his advisers was near-unanimous: he had to do more to establish his own agenda. Since then, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has hinted that he would be more aggressive in dealing with the Soviets, would enforce civil-rights laws more vigorously, would spend more on education and do more to clean up the environment than the president he has served for the past 7 -LCB- years. He has also proposed many of his own initiatives, including a $ 2.2 billion child care program, a ban on offshore ocean dumping, and a reorganizaton of the anti-drug effort under the office of vice president. He also has proposed a new White House ethics office and a `` flexible freeze'' on federal spending. But most of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s moves away from the administration have been cautious, for fear of appearing disloyal. `` I'm not going to change just to emerge from a shadow,'' he has said. In a recent interview, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he will differ with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when he feels he has a different set of goals. `` I have every intention of saying, here is what we've done and and here are my priorities. `` But I'm not doing that to quote distance myself, to show my own identity,'' he continued. `` I'm doing it to say, look, here is what we've done. Here are the successes, and here are the shortcomings, and here's what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will do.'' Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s close identification with the administration continues to pose problems for him as Democrats keep driving home their `` Where is <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' slogan. When the general election campaign heats up after Labor Day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to be hit repeatedly by Democrats for his role _ still vague _ in some of the less popular <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration decisions, including arms-for-hostages dealings with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and past support for Panamanian dictator <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Meanwhile, the impact of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy has already been seen in a number of recent presidential decisions _ including <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s selection last week of a Hispanic, <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, to be education secretary _ fulfilling in advance a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign pledge <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> filled two other Cabinet vacancies with people on close terms with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, naming former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to succeed <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> as attorney general and Wall Street investment banker <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to follow <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as treasury secretary. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> resigned to run <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign. The president also yielded to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s urgings in deciding to allow a plant-closing notification bill to become law and in the president's veto of a $ 299.5 billion defense authorization bill. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also has picked up on some of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign themes, including advocating the death penalty for `` drug kingpins.'' `` I do n't think it's as much a matter of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> disagreeing or separating himself from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as much as demonstrating that his agenda is a little different,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who is a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> convention adviser. And <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sears </PERSON>, another Republican consultant, said: `` The real moment of truth is when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accepts the nomination.'' `` He can campaign on the virtues of what eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration have brought to the country. And he can prove himself presidential. In his acceptance speech, he can do it all,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said.

His clients included former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, labor leader <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connally </PERSON> and underworld boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>. A former national treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had a personal relationship with every president from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> asked him to be director of central intelligence in 1975 and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> offered him the same job last year. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> declined both times _ citing his preference for independence the first time and failing health on the second occasion. President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was an intense adversary during the Watergate scandal when <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> represented the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in a suit against <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s reelection campaign committee. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, in remarks later revealed by disclosure of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tapes, had vowed to `` fix'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The celebrated lawyer privately called <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> `` snake brains.'' But years later the two men became amicable after <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Sports heroes, political figures and fellow baseball team owners paid tribute to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> on his death. `` He was one of the most remarkable men I've every known,'' said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Selig </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewers </ORGANIZATION> team. `` He had a spirit the rest of the world could take a lesson from.'' The Brewers, playing host to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' Orioles on Sunday, observed a moment of silence at <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> and lowered flags to half mast. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Califano </PERSON>, a former cabinet official of President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and one-time law partner with <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, said, `` He was the best everything. He was the best father, the best husband, the best lawyer, the best partner, the best friend ... and he was extraordinarily brave.'' Former Oriole star <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a Hall of Fame third baseman and now announcer for the team, credited <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> with keeping the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> rather than moving it to the nearby nation's capital `` He made a monumental effort as far as keeping the team there,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` He was good for <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> baseball.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> succumbed to cancer after seven operations. But his friends and associates said that almost to the end, the disease did not deter him from hard work. `` I try to be guided by the ethics I was taught by the Jesuits,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> once said. `` A trial is like a war.'' The son of a department store floorwalker, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was born May 31, 1920 in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and decided early in his life to become a lawyer. He graduated with highest honors in 1941 from <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and enrolled at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law school after his discharge from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> because of back injuries. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> survived the crash of a bomber during a training exercise, an accident in which everyone else on board died. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> set up his own law firm in 1949 and his first big-name client was Sen. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, whose name became synonymous with communist baiting. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, acknowledging that he represented unsavory characters, never shunned the role. `` The more opprobrium that was attached to the client, the more I relished the case,'' he said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION> after co-owner <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> acquired controlling interest of the team and bought out <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' share <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> by that time already had purchased the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' tenure with the team was controversial and mixed with success and failure. The <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> won a World Series in 1983 but now are at the bottom of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' acquisition of high-priced stars generally failed to pan out. He is survived his wife, <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Neill </PERSON>, a former lawyer in his law firm; three children by his first wife, and four children by his second marriage.

<HEAD>Police And Solidarity Supporters Clash In Gdansk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police and Solidarity supporters clashed Sunday after ceremonies marking the eighth anniverary of strikes that launched the now outlawed independent union federation, witnesses said. Police moved in with truncheons against more than 100 demonstrators as they marched for about 45 minutes through <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>'s old town, said a Solidarity activist who spoke on condition of anonymity Witnesses said a melee broke out after a chair was thrown into the line of security police as they attempted to block the marchers. Demonstrators then hurled tables and chairs from a nearby cafe as the helmeted riot police rushed the crowd. About 20 young people were injured in the clash, several seriously, and a dozen were detained, the Solidarity spokesman said. The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>, in a dispatch late Sunday, said six police officers were injured in the clash, which it said was touched off by demonstrators `` behaving in an extremely aggressive way.'' It said the protesters chanted anti-communist slogans, attacked police with rocks and demolished a cafe. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the demonstrators also interrupted the peaceful activities at a nearby fair. It gave no details about arrests or the number of injured demonstrators. The clashes came after thousands attended a service at a nearby church marking the anniversary of the beginning of the 1980 strike. After the services, Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> spoke to 3,000 people who had gathered outside <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION>'s church, a Solidarity stronghold. `` Our struggle is continuing,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` We want to live in a better <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with more dignity.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Solidarity leaders will meet on Aug. 28 in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> to discuss a text on the union's future. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> acknowledged that much had changed since 1980 and that there was `` no return to that period.'' He said the union is now committed to `` evolutionary solutions,'' rather than radical action. Witnesses said that after the gathering at the church, marchers made their way to the center of town, which was packed with visitors to a local fair. The marchers shouted Solidarity slogans and were joined by large numbers of passers-by before security forces blocked their path, witnesses said. On Friday, 2,000 shipyard workers and other Solidarity supporters attended a ceremony marking the anniversary near the entrance to the Lenin shipyard. Police watched that ceremony but did not move in. At that ceremony, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> helped put wreaths and flowers on a monument erected to honor striking shipyard workers killed by security forces during labor unrest in 1970. On Aug. 14, 1980, workers in the Lenin shipyards in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> began a strike over reinstating a fired crane operator. Two days later the demands grew to include an independent trade union, and Solidarity was born. The union at its peak claimed about 10 million members, or nearly one-third of the nation's population. The union was crushed when martial law was imposed in 1981. It was banned by Parliament the next year.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators came close to sealing a deal last week on overhauling the nation's welfare system, but failed at least partly because of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s continued insistence that it include some form of work requirement The lawmakers left town for a three-week recess amid signs of increasing frustration at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's adamant opposition to any bill that does not include a workfare provision. `` We've said from the start, if there's no work requirement, there's no welfare reform,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, assistant to the president, who represented the White House at meetings Thursday on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> added, `` I do n't think we were the reason it fell apart ... I do n't believe we were within striking distance of a deal at all.'' Intensive negotiations had progressed last week against the backdrop of presidential politics. Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> personally called some lawmakers to urge that a compromise be completed this year. House members and some senators were optimistic that a daylong series of meetings, offers and counter-offers Thursday could settle the major differences. But that was before <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> put on the brakes. There were signs at week's end that some <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats closer to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s position on the workfare requirements than the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators might prefer a showdown with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rather than bow to it. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiating team and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee for vice president, indicated lawmakers might send <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a plan that does n't meet his specifications. `` We're not going to let him dictate the contents of the bill,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Thursday. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills stress parental responsibility for children, through more intensive child support collections and a new emphasis on work. Each require states to set up large-scale education, training and work programs for welfare mothers and to offer child care, transportation and Medicaid benefits needed to make the programs a success. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill as passed would cost more than twice the five-year, $ 2.8 billion <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan. House negotiators made a $ 1.1 billion concession by scrapping financial incentives for states to raise cash benefits. And other compromises had brought the two sides within shouting distance by Thursday's last offers: $ 2.9 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, $ 3.3 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Lawmakers thought they had found a solution Thursday to concerns over both costs and workfare: drop a requirement that two-parent unemployed families be eligible for welfare, and along with it a requirement that one of the parents work 16 hours a week in a public job, beginning in fiscal 1994. `` I thought it was a real stroke of genius,'' said <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, a Democrat, who helped <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lobby lawmakers last week by telephone. `` But it apparently created a White House problem.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for months had threatened to veto any welfare overhaul bill that mandated two-parent welfare eligibility, now allowed in only half the states. But last week the White House insisted that the provision be kept _ as a vehicle for the 16-hour work requirement. `` They were removing the only work requirement that's anywhere in either of those bills,'' <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> said. `` The president's top advisors will recommend a veto if there's no work requirement.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferees already have agreed to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provision, also added under administration pressure, requiring states to eventually enroll 22 percent of non-exempt welfare recipients in their jobs programs. It's unclear whether lawmakers, when they return after Labor Day, will resume discussions about dropping the two-parent provision or try to keep it and hammer out a compromise on the work requirement. But <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said the negotiators are so close to an overall agreement `` there's no way the whole thing could fall victim to a veto over this -LRB- mandatory work -RRB- issue.'' `` We'll keep plugging away; we've still got time,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Bomber Much Like U.S. B-1B, Air Force General Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s once-secret Blackjack bomber is an expanded version of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s B-1B bomber, according to the only <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer to have seen the giant Soviet warplane. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fornell </PERSON> described the bomber in a story in Sunday's editions of the Dayton Daily News as being a close copy of the B-1B, from its pivoting wings to the rotary cruise missile launcher on its belly. For years, only the skimpiest details about the giant bomber were available outside the Kremlin or <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> intelligence files. The Soviets allowed <PERSON> Fornell </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> to take a close look at the plane on Aug. 2 while the two were on a four-day tour of Soviet military bases. Soviet officials had earlier been allowed to climb aboard a B-1B during a visit to <ORGANIZATION> Ellsworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Like the B-1B, the Blackjack is designed to fly low and fast during long-range strategic bombing missions, firing nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. <PERSON> Fornell </PERSON>, a former bomber test pilot with more than 6,000 flying hours in more than 40 types of aircraft and an adviser to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, said he believed there is evidence that the Soviets copied at least the basic aerodynamic features of the B-1B. But he said it was impossible to tell during his 15-minute inspection whether the Blackjack's designers merely took advantage of public information on the B-1B or profited from espionage. `` It's hard to determine, not actually having flown the airplane or seen its actual combat capability, what was done as far as the internal workings of their equipment,'' he said. Even the crew assignments resemble the American bomber. `` It has four crewmembers, two pilots and what they described as an offensive -LRB- systems operator -RRB- and defense systems operator, and the layout inside is very similar to that of the B-1B,'' he said.

 Hungarian army dancers joined pipers, buglers and drummers from 10 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> regiments and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> high school band Sunday in a parade opening the world's largest arts festival On a blustery afternoon in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s capital, about 200,000 people thronged the sidewalks on Princes Street for the traditional cavalcade heralding the 42nd Edinburgh International Festival. Some spectators were startled by the sounds of small firearms and 20-foot whips that accompanied the parade, as army officers saluted the procession from a review platform at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. The 50 men and women dancers of the Hungarian army ensemble, which is on its first visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, will join the other army bands in the so-called tattoo at <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> _ a military display with soldiers in kilts playing bagpies and drums at night on the lighted castle grounds. `` We are not soldiers. Our army sponsors us and we all learned to dance in the national ballet school,'' said dancer <PERSON> Csaba </PERSON> <PERSON> Horvath </PERSON>, 20. The Governor <ORGANIZATION> Livingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, specialists in bagpipes, bugles and drums, got a big hand as they played `` <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> the Brave.'' `` We always like to get an American band _ they're so lively and cheerful, they give you a lift,'' said parade organizer <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The teen-age band _ 47 girls in kilts and 25 boys in scarlet coats and dark blue pants _ are on a two-week visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The Aug. 14 - Sept. 5 festival features symphony orchestras, the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Grand Opera production of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' `` <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' plays in several languages, puppet shows, cabaret and art exhibitions. The <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> festival regularly comes up with something extraordinary. This year it's likely to be the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Ninagawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, with its innovative production of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` The Tempest. The company, then known as <ORGANIZATION> Toho </ORGANIZATION>, was the hit of the festival in 1985 with <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` Macbeth'' and again in 1986 with the Greek tragedy `` Medea.'' Besides the hundreds of performances at the official festival, the unofficial Festival Fringe has 9,000 performances of 913 shows by 473 companies in every available hall and in the streets. `` Our advance ticket sales this year so far are the best ever at $ 261,800,'' said <PERSON> Mhairi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackenzie-Robinson </PERSON>, who administers the Fringe. But <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON>, director of the official festival, is struggling this year with a budget of $ 4.6 million. `` I've just been to the first <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> festival,'' said <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON>. `` They had $ 8.5 million to spend and they did not, I think, do more than we do or sell a higher percentage of seats. `` We do it by working everybody out of their wits,'' he added, `` and by depending on the kindness of other countries' governments to help pay travel costs, because they are keen to send their national artists to <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 A television network stopped broadcasting a historical series after producers protested that episodes were cut to drop references to a former president, the father of an opposition leader, a magazine said. The private <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> network dropped the last 30 episodes from its re-broadcast of the 170-episode `` Path to Glory'' epic, which dramatizes Mexican history from 1917 to the 1938 nationalization of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s oil industry by President <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>' son is <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, the official runner-up in the July 6 presidential election. The younger <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> says he was fraudulently denied victory by the government and the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, candidate of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, called for nationwide demonstrations Sunday to demand the government clear up allegations of vote fraud. Proceso magazine reported that <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION>'s July 30 episode of `` Path to Glory'' was altered to delete some historical facts and figures and create fictional characters missing from the original version. <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> also announced it was suspending its broadcast of the series, which was commissioned by the network and the government's <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> The popular series, featuring 700 actors and 5,000 extras, was broadcast in its entirety last year. <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeron </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, historical adviser to the series, suggested in an interview with the magazine that the episode was censored in part for political reasons. `` The immediate explanation is obvious. The case has a political facet: the strength that <PERSON> Cardenism </PERSON> has in the current -LRB- political -RRB- dispute motivated a white hand to cut ` Path to Glory,''' <PERSON> Zeron </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Araiza </PERSON>, director of the series, said: `` I do n't know the cause of the mutilation but neither does that matter to me. It appears to me to be an act of barbarism without precedent.'' <PERSON> Zeron </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> protested the dropping of the episodes in letters to <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sainz </PERSON>. `` With surprise I found that all the scenes referring to the presidential activities of <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> were suppressed,'' <PERSON> Zeron </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Aleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zeron </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Proceso </PERSON> that <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sainz </PERSON> summoned him to a meeting at the institute in March, about two months after the rebroadcast of `` Path to Glory'' began. `` There in his office he told me that ` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>' had asked him to be careful with the army, with the relatives of the historical figures, with the heroes and religious sentiments,'' <PERSON> Zeron </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> said. When asked which president, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sainz </PERSON> responded: `` that of the Republic,'' <PERSON> Zeron </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s outgoing president is Miguel de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> spokesman reached by telephone said the network would not have any comment on the matter until Monday. <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> ensured his stature as perhaps the most revered of Mexican presidents when he nationalized the oil industry. He also distributed millions of acres of land to peasants under <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s agrarian reform law. The elder <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> died in 1970. <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> has claimed he defeated governing party candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> in the July 6 election. He was a member of the governing party before resigning last year to mount his own candidacy. The Chamber of Deputies, sitting as the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, begins a session Monday to ratify the election results. Opposition parties accused Televisa of pro-government bias in covering the presidential campaign and of virtually ignoring post-election protests.

 A panhandler in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> puts his pitch to a rap beat: `` Give a contribution, `` To fight destitution, `` Without retribution, `` Money's the solution.'' Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, however, believes the solution is to put up posters in the subways, telling New Yorkers to pass that beggar by. `` In most cases, in my judgment, the money that you give in the street to beggars goes for booze and drugs,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said last week. `` It is not in the best interest of this city to encourage people to panhandle instead of looking for jobs.'' For many New Yorkers, every day brings an encounter with two, three or more beggars: shouting mendicants who move from car to car on the subways with tales of lost homes, unemployment or AIDS; passive panhandlers slouched on the street behind placards saying `` homeless'' and `` hungry;'' street psychologists who can mug a queasy conscience with a soft `` God bless you'' after being turned down. `` The best thing you can do if you really want to help,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, `` is to give any such charitable contributions to your church or your synagogue or the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> or a whole host of legitimate agencies that will then use the money for a valid and good purpose, not for booze and drugs.'' `` There is nothing wrong about giving money to organizations,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> director of the Coalition for the Homeless, `` but I do n't think when people pass a panhandler they say, ` There's 25 cents that I wo n't give to my church this week.''' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s anti-begging pronouncements have cut down on contributions, `` but not as much as we thought it would,'' a panhandler on Fifth Avenue who identified himself as <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> said Sunday morning. As for the fear that the money goes for drugs and alcohol, `` it just is n't true,'' said the soft-spoken, white-haired man who said he has been on the street since January. `` I would say _ I know an awful lot of panhandlers _ that it's less than 5 percent.'' `` There are a lot of drug addicts out here,'' said a panhandler up the street who identified himself as <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` They need $ 80 - $ 90 a day Some of them get it and shoot it right up.'' `` If I make $ 20 a day that's not too bad,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>, who sleeps outside the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> and insists that he is a panhandler, not a beggar. `` Panhandler sounds better,'' he said. `` A panhandler does n't steal.'' Asked why begging is so prevalent, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said: `` I guess because we're easy marks.'' A survey of 250 people commissioned by <PERSON> Crain </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year found that two-thirds gave money to beggars, and 51 percent said they contributed to organizations that help the homeless. The Metropolitan Transit Authority surveyed 1,200 New Yorkers and found that three out of five gave money to beggars, although 80 percent said they found the panhandlers annoying. `` Tourists do n't give you money,'' said <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON>, who was all but ignored by passersby. `` Native New Yorkers give you money.'' Begging is n't illegal in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, though panhandlers may be encouraged to move. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, prodded by downtown merchants who were afraid of losing their customers, enacted an ordinance last year to ban aggressive panhandling. That inspired laws this year in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, went after aggressive beggars last year by making it illegal to interfere with pedestrians. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON>, director of development for the soup kitchen at <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apostles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, endorsed <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s advice `` If you give money directly to beggars, they might not use it to get food,'' she said. But the Rev. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenlaw </PERSON> of Holy Apostles called the mayor's position `` utterly gratuitous and insensitive. `` I'm assaulted, as is everyone else, by people with their hands out,'' <PERSON> Greenlaw </PERSON> said. `` I'm offended by that too, but the answer, it seems to me, is not to advise people not to respond.'' If the goal is to force beggars to rely on government and charitable programs, <PERSON> Greenlaw </PERSON> added, there just are n't enough programs. His church, which has 125 members, serves up to 1,000 people in its soup kitchen every day in addition to taking 300 or so bag lunches to women and children in dilapidated hotels. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, executive director of the First Moravian-Grand Central Drop-In Center, said 90 percent of the homeless who visit that center suffer some kind of chemical dependence. `` Many panhandlers are ignored by the social service system,'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> wrote in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, `` but the frustrating truth is that these out-of-pocket donations only aggravate the problems they are meant to relieve.'' The root of the problem, <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> said, is that welfare payments are below the poverty level. `` If you have a place to live, you may have to decide between paying the rent and buying food,'' he said. `` Begging is not an equitable way to deal with the problem, or an efficient way. But it's the only way for some people,'' <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> said.

 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> expects to begin a weekly half-hour television program next month, his chief spokesman said Sunday. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> prelate's program hopefully will feature `` an entirely new type of format for a religious program,'' according to Monsignor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s spokesman. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> will spend the program discussing religious topics with guests, <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said.

When <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was named archbishop of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1984 he expressed interest in having such a regular television program, and has said he believes religious leaders must use the electronic media to get their message across.

<HEAD>Attempted Arson On Two U.S. Embassy Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An attacker tried to burn two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy cars in the carport of an embassy worker's home near the capital, police said Sunday. Police were trying to determine if the attack was related to earlier attacks on the property of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South African officials. In the latest incident, someone poured a flammable liquid around two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> cars Saturday night in Holder, a suburb of <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, said a police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity. The assailant threw several lit matches on the fluid, which burst briefly into flames then went out, the spokesman said. Police found a note in the carport with an anti-American slogan, but declined to reveal its contents. No one was injured. `` Obviously security is uppermost in everyone's mind,'' the spokesman said. `` We will discuss a review of security at the embassy.'' No one at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy was immediately available for comment. The spokesman said the attempted arson may be related to three similar incidents involving the property of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South African embassies. On March 22, two incendiary devices were thrown into the courtyard of a South African Embassy staff member's residence, causing minor damage to a wall. On April 10, a <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> car belonging to the South African Embassy's third secretary was destroyed in a firebomb attack. And on July 17, a firebomb caused superficial damage to a car belonging to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military attache. No one was hurt in any of the attacks.

<TEXT>
 Adm. <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumalt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who ordered the use of Agent Orange in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, says the cancer death of his son moves him to work harder for compensation for other veterans affected by the toxic defoliant. `` There are still many hundreds of veterans who do need help,'' <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> said Saturday, the day his son died. `` I believe very strongly now that the evidence is clear that the Agent Orange is responsible for the problems many veterans are having.'' <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 42, who was exposed to Agent Orange, died at his home in <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>. He was diagnosed in January 1983 as having non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Two years later doctors found he had lymphoma <PERSON> Hodgkins </PERSON> disease. <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, suffers from a congenital dysfunction that confuses his physical senses. Since the war, Adm. <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> and his son had pushed for government assistance to veterans affected by Agent Orange. On June 30, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> removed the last legal obstacle to a $ 180 million settlement between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and the manufacturers of Agent Orange. The justices let stand rulings that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged the 1984 settlement. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, `` The President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are deeply saddened and extend their prayers to the <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> family.'' The younger <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> was commanding a boat along the rivers of the Ca <LOCATION> Mau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> when his father, the American naval commander in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, ordered the spraying of Agent Orange to defoliate the jungle along the waterways in order to save servicemen by depriving the enemy of concealment for ambushes. Before the spraying, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces had a 6 percent casualty rate each month. Afterward, that figure dropped to less than 1 percent. `` I do not second guess the decisions Dad made in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, nor do I doubt for a minute that the saving of human life was always his first priority in his conduct of the war,'' the younger <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> once said. `` I have the greatest love and admiration for him as a man, and the deepest respect for him as a military leader.'' Young <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> once swam through water doused with Agent Orange to collect weapons from a convoy of <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> boats, winning over a hostile crew that had called him `` the little admiral'' and `` brass brat'' behind his back. The Zumwalts chronicled their battle with cancer in 1986 with the book, `` My Father, My Son,'' which they wrote with author <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pekkanen </PERSON>. The book was presented in a made-for-television movie in May. <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> said his son was strong until the end, even joking and teasing with family members during conversations that began Friday evening. `` We had a long conversation, his wife and children and his brother and me, with him from about 7:30 -LRB- Friday night -RRB- until about 1 o'clock this morning,'' the admiral said Saturday. `` He was rational and very courageous.'' <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> was standing by his son's side with other family members when his son died in his sleep.

 A sprightly new production of <PERSON> Rossini </PERSON>'s `` The Barber of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>'' has been added to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> repertoire. At the second performance in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION> on Saturday, <PERSON> Erie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> was <PERSON> Rosina </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gran </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was Count <LOCATION> Almaviva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orth </PERSON> was <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Opalach </PERSON> was <PERSON> Rosina </PERSON>'s guardian Dr. Bartolo. <PERSON> Lofti </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansouri </PERSON> directed stage action, which was lively but not eccentric. <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Heeley </PERSON>, who has designed prestigious stage and opera productions in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION>, designed sets and costumes. Some of Miss Mills' costumes looked like those of <PERSON> Rosina </PERSON>'s soon after the opera's premiere in 1816. The set was attractive, with a facade centered inside an archway. The facade was turned around to become either an outside door with street in front of it or the inside door of a room. Miss Mills seems so natural as <PERSON> Rosina </PERSON>, her singing so delightful and her acting so charming, that it would be easy simply to accept and ignore her. Thinking about it later, one recognizes and appreciates her artistry. <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> was dressed in a green velvet suit trimmed with orange. With <PERSON> Orth </PERSON>'s toothy smile, he presents himself originally as an early 19th century nerd. This <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> smoothed out into a pleasant fellow rather than the `` character'' he sometimes is. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> has a sweet tenor that does not turn cloying and he's a slim, elegant Count. He also acted so effectively in his impersonations as an elderly, drunk soldier and a singing teacher that he added much to the mirth of this `` Barber.'' <PERSON> Opalach </PERSON>, in a gray wig that stuck out like donkey ears on each side, sang with conviction and was amusing as Bartolo. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dworchak </PERSON> as the real singing teacher and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaulis </PERSON> as Bartolo's housekeeper sang well and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Billings </PERSON> made the tiny part of a sleepy servant greatly amusing every time he was on stage. Music director <PERSON> Sergiu </PERSON> <PERSON> Comissiona </PERSON> conducted. The opera was sung in Italian. English surtitles in white flashed on a screen above the stage but were overlighted and left on the screen so briefly that most of them could n't be read enitrely.

 A charismatic Catholic church has attracted even more than the 20,000 people predicted from across the country for a service at which many expect miracles of healing or at least faith, officials say. Monday rosary services at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neumann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have become the focus of national attention since three parishioners claimed to receive messages from the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> during weekly rosaries. `` I believe <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> will bring blessings to us then,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Constancio </PERSON>, a former hospital therapist, who along with her husband quit their jobs to spend more time praying. Thousands of pilgrims arrived for two days of worship in advance of the Monday night Mass and rosary. <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> police and the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which are responsible for crowd control, said dozens of worshipers stayed at the church overnight into Sunday. `` They were down there all last night, praying and lighting candles and singing,'' said Col. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> police. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Slate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Constancio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> have said that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> has told them to expect a miracle on Monday's Feast of the Assumption, the day Catholics celebrate the ascension of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> into Heaven. While many handicapped people have come to the church hoping for phsyical healing, others said they were seeking spiritual renewal. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, his wife, niece and 11-year-old son drove from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> and attended Sunday's Mass. `` My son has been sick a long time,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. `` Last year I had to carry him in my arms. Now he can walk but he's still sick.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said he does n't know what to expect Monday but wanted to come anyway. `` Maybe my son can get better,'' he said. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said she came to strengthen her faith. `` Like they said in church, that so many people would come here to pray together is a miracle,'' she said. `` It really does n't matter what happens tomorrow -LRB- Monday -RRB-. Sunday's throng of worshipers sparked concern from officials about crowd control on Monday. `` I've seen people leave their car in the middle of traffic if they're late for a -LRB- football -RRB- kickoff,'' said policeman <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON>. `` You can just imagine what would happen if they're late for a miracle.''

<HEAD>AIDS Spawns New Kind of Hypochondriac, Psychologist Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 AIDS has spawned a new kind of hypochondriac: people convinced they are infected by the AIDS virus despite medical evidence to the contrary, a psychologist who has treated such people said Sunday. Even monthly blood tests for up to a year have failed to quell the fear in some of them, said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> psychologist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. In many cases, the fear stems from guilt over a past sexual incident. `` These people are terrified,'' and their condition can make them avoid sex with their spouses for fear of infecting them, and disrupt their concentration at work, <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said. One of his patients was afraid to hold his newborn baby for fear of infecting the child, he said in an interview. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> discussed treatment of people with `` AFRAIDS,'' which stands for acute fear regarding AIDS, at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. When anxiety and depression causes such symptoms as weight loss, fatigue or reduced resistance to disease, afflicted people interpret the symptoms as signs of AIDS, he said. Even a bruise from a bumped elbow may be perceived as the mark of an AIDS-related cancer called <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma, he said. He said he has treated 10 patients since seeing his first case two years ago, and other psychologists have told him they are seeing it too. But he did not have any figures on how many cases might exist. The problem often is rooted in guilt over an extramarital affair, a visit to a prostitute or a homosexual experience, he said. Sometimes the experience occurred years before. Sex with an infected person can spread the AIDS virus. One man <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> treated, married for 10 years, had had sex wih a female neighbor. About a month later he heard his minister describe AIDS as punishment for sins, and about a week after that he noticed he had lost weight and suffered diarrhea. Both were due to anxiety, but the man interpreted them as evidence of AIDS, <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said. His worry persisted after a blood test proved negative, and he was referred to <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> by an AIDS hot line. Most people can significantly reduce their anxiety with treatment, he said. Therapists can explain the facts about acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and explain how people who are worried tend to become over-concerned by coughs or other `` symptoms'' most people would ignore. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> asks his patients to carry copies of negative blood test results in their wallets. He also teaches them about reducing anxiety by focusing on their present lives and what is going on around them, and dealing with guilt. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said people who recognize the problem in themselves or others should contact an AIDS hot line for the name of a psychologist familiar with AIDS-related issues.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> pulled half its troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Sunday, one day before the deadline, and rebels captured a key provincial capital after troops left, the commander of Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> said at a news conference in the Afghan capital, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, that none of the troops he commands remains in 25 of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 30 provinces, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Under a U.N.-sponsored agreement, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was to have half its estimated 100,000 troops out by Monday. U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas fired missiles at the Afghan capital, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and shelled two other Afghan cities, killing 19 people, the news agency said Sunday. From May 15, when the Soviet pullout began, to July 15, the anti-communist insurgents carried out almost 3,000 armed attacks and 96 terrorist and diversionary operations, <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> told reporters. He confirmed Western reports that rebels took control of the northern provincial capital of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> after Soviet troops left the area in the first week of August. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying he `` had no doubt that in the very near future,'' <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government would regain control <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> lies 40 miles south of the Soviet border along a major road leading from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Reports reaching <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, said almost all provincial capitals remain in communist hands. Guerrillas have seized three provincial capitals since May 15 but abandoned them later under heavy Soviet aerial bombardment. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. Under U.N.-mediated peace accords signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in April, all the troops are to be out by Feb. 15. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said the halfway point in withdrawal was reached Saturday, when a Soviet motorized regiment of 200 vehicles and 3,000 troops left for home from the western Afghan city of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>. As President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flew from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, his spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, told reporters: `` The Soviets appear to be on schedule in withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord, half of their forces should be out by today. We can never be absolutely certain, but it appears they have met that schedule.'' Officials of the Afghan government said their armed forces were capable of defending the country without Soviet troops. `` At this critical moment in the fate of the country, the armed forces will steadfastly defend the republic, strengthen vigilance and battle-readiness. On this score I, as the head of the general staff, have no doubts,'' Col. Gen. <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanai </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION>, in an interview published Sunday. Some Western, Pakistani and guerrilla sources have predicted <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s communist government will fall quickly after the Soviet military leaves. Even a former Soviet military adviser in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsagolov </PERSON>, has expressed doubt the Afghan army can hold its own after the Soviet pullout. <PERSON> Tanai </PERSON>, in the newspaper interview, acknowledged rebels were focusing their attacks on areas evacuated by Soviet troops, but said Afghan government forces are `` resolutely repulsing'' the guerrillas. In weekend fighting, government troops killed several insurgents in the <LOCATION> Asmar </LOCATION> district of the Afghan province of <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Twenty-seven rebels were killed and an arms depot was captured in the <LOCATION> Injil </LOCATION> district of the western province of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>, the news agency said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say whether the combat operations were conducted by Afghan or Soviet troops. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, three missiles killed four women and a child and wounded six people, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Shelling in the residential areas of <LOCATION> Gardez </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> killed 14 people and wounded 20, according to the news agency. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a mosque was destroyed and several apartment buildings damaged in <LOCATION> Gardez </LOCATION>, about 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Afghan army units killed 30 rebels in the <LOCATION> Buri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heil </LOCATION> district near <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, the news agency said.

 Democrats taking up the chant `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>'' might be tempted to ask their own vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, `` Where is <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, campaigning in the state both he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> call home, hardly ever mentions the vice president. His barbs, even when clearly aimed at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, start with `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration,'' or `` The Republicans,'' or simply `` They.'' Around the country, Democratic partisans recite `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>'' as both a rallying cry and chide to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as failing to speak up when the administration made policy gaffes like the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> denied in an interview with reporters that he is making any special effort to avoid discussing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by name. But even in the small group covering his campaign, he is keeping his jibes subtle. `` I'm going to make the issues and pound on them and that's what I'm trying to do,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s aides say there are several reasons not to attack <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> directly, chief among them the vice president's own <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> background. Texans may not warm to personal attacks against one of their own. In addition, while <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are not political allies, they and their families are privately friendly, according to both sides. The vice president himself has been holding fire, saying he's running against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and not <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who is one of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' most popular figures. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> seems to be returning the favor. For example, he declined to comment on a published report that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been misrepresenting his war record. `` I'm not going to get into that, what happens in combat,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, himself a World War II bomber pilot. `` I'm not going to question his story at all.'' But while there's cordiality now, the political climate is heating up. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has announced plans to move some of his national campaign operation to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It does n't worry me, he's had his operations here before'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, referring to the 1970 campaign when the two men last faced each other in an election and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> won. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> says he is prepared to take the gloves off and start pounding <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when it becomes necessary. `` I'm sure we will be as we go along,'' he said. `` Let's see how the campaign develops. I've attacked the issues and this administration of which he is a major part.''

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Republicans believe they have a special role at the national convention, providing other delegates an inside look at the Democrat they love to hate _ <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` The people from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> know <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> best, and they will help call attention to the ` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Mirage' and help to describe who <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> really is,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide and state representative who has rejoined the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. The delegation will act as a `` truth squad of sorts,'' he said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, the former state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> executive director who is running against Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said he has talked to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Republicans `` who lament the fact that they never really got the message out about how bad <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> would be for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> We do n't want to repeat that mistake.'' `` The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> delegation will be the most well-informed delegation in terms of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and there's a responsibility on our part that other Republicans throughout the nation know the facts,'' <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been the chief target of state Republicans since he won his first gubernatorial race in 1974. He is in his 10th year as governor, losing a re-election bid in 1978 and returning to office in 1983. State Republicans believe the nation is getting a skewed view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> through television. `` He is holding himself out now as something he really is n't at all, portraying himself as a moderate and in some cases a conservative,'' said Assistant Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>. `` He's an authentic, dues-paying, card-carrying, textbook liberal. That's what he's always been, but that's not the image he portrays,'' <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> said. `` I think we might be helpful to the other delegations who are looking for an inside view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamie </PERSON> plans to unveil a video Tuesday produced by the state committee that attacks <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on issues from the environment to the budget. State party officials plan to distribute the tape to the other 49 state party chiefs. But the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> delegation does not have any plans to dispatch delegates to various convention caucuses in a formal way. `` We've discussed that and my understanding is that we will just wait to be pounced upon,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> GOP Leader <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>.

 A strong earthquake occurred Sunday near the coast of central <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tsunami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> reported. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The earthquake at 1:53 p.m. EDT registered 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, but did not generate a Pacific-wide tsunami, or sea wave, the center here said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said the quake was felt strongly in <LOCATION> Caldera </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, about 400 miles north of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country. The magnitude was the largest recorded in that general area since a quake measuring 7.3 occurred Oct. 4, 1983. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 6.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 5.5. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lauded his loyal vice president for `` strength, vision and true grit'' Sunday as he arrived in a Republican National Convention city where speculation swirled endlessly about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of a running mate. `` The masquerade is over. It's time to talk issues; to use the dreaded ` L' word, to say the policies of our opposition and the congressional leadership of his party are liberal, liberal, liberal,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in prepared remarks for a campaign rally a few blocks from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> convention hall. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was at home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, his nomination set for next Wednesday night, satisfied to let <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> start the ball rolling on a week worth of Dukakis-bashing. Talk of a running mate dominated the political discussion in the sweltering city, and many of the contenders made the rounds of the morning talk shows before plunging into another day of pre-convention receptions. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> put in a plug for his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, and insisted despite evidence to the contrary that he was n't campaigning for the post himself Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> described himself as `` a liability'' and asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to tap <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> _ Bob, that is. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> expressed the hope that he might be `` acceptable to the whole party.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, sworn in only Friday, sounded ready to swap jobs. `` I have a job to do for this president and until I've heard anything from the vice president, I'm ready to go to work as attorney general,'' he said. A chain link security fence sprang up overnight around the Superdome, one more strand in the web of security at the hall where Republicans will spend four days praising extolling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and aiming barbs at <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Inside, in one of the hundreds of rooms that ring the vast convention floor, a squad of Republican speechwriters reviewed scripts submitted by dozens of speakers to make sure they would fit within the allotted time. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, while running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> resumed a campaign tour of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has generally avoided mentioning fellow Texan <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by name, and he told reporters, `` I'm trying to make the issues and pound on them and that's what I'm trying to do The pre-convention weekend approximated an endless, moveable party, from a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> dinner cruise for the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to an extravagant bash for 5,000 guests hosted by the city's newspaper, the Times-Picayune. `` We're party animals! Right!'' shouted <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellou-Vogel </PERSON>, one of the 700 volunteers recruited to make sure delegates arriving at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> airport were in the proper frame of mind. `` It's the heart of the Big Easy,'' explained <PERSON> Nita </PERSON> <PERSON> Minter </PERSON>, over from <LOCATION> Slidell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, for the festivities. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appearance at the downtown rally was one of two speeches on his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> schedule. His remarks to the delegates Monday night were set up as the highlight of the opening session of the convention. The president and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet only briefly Tuesday morning before the president leaves town in a carefully choreographed sequence designed to show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emerging as the new leader of the Republican party. In his remarks to Republicans in gathered a few blocks from the Superdome, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ripped into the Democrats. `` The party of ` yes' has become the party of ` no,''' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who was a Democrat until 1962. The president accused the Democrats of saying ` no' to holding the line on taxes, to spending cuts and on other issues ranging from the death penalty to the school prayer amendment. The televised interviews added little or nothing to the sum of knowledge about the only mystery of the Republican convention week, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said nothing to help. He had lunch at his official residence in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, his top campaign adviser, then worked on his acceptance speech with <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, his media consultant and debate coach. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, said the `` necessary work'' had been completed on eight to 10 vice presidential candidates in advance of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pick, although he declined to be drawn into a discussion of any of them. `` He will make a selection that this convention will ratify heartily,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s combative campaign manager. There was no doubt about that, especially since the vice president commanded the loyalty of all but a few dozen delegates pledged to former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, less defiant than last week, pledged to support the vice president's selection but still warned of a `` conservative gap'' if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't make a right-minded pick. `` We want a flesh and blood conservative,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> voiced a rebuttal, calling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a `` moderate conservative'' who does not share all the views of the far right. `` They've saddled him with a platform that as far as I'm concerned, you can pour bacmk in the horse.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' that he has asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> not to consider him for the ticket. `` I've had a very checkered career,'' said the No. 2 man in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've punched the lights out of a lot of sacred cows ... I would be a liability for <PERSON> George </PERSON>.'' The plusses and minuses about the contenders was easy to figure. One party source said <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, popular in a region where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran poorly in the primaries, was lobbying strongly behind the scenes for the job, and had relayed assurances that he would toe the line that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s handlers would lay down for him. But one <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide said opposition within the camp was strong, largely because of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s penchant for cutting remarks, such as his demand that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` stop lying about my record'' during the primary campaign. `` Did I say that?'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> deadpanned on Sunday. As for possible opposition from <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, he said, `` Sen. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s influence is not widespread.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, just 41 years old, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> that he would `` like to believe that I would be acceptable to the whole party.''

 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, spurned by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other Republican candidates, said Sunday she sees `` a broad common ground'' between her union and the GOP. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, in a pep talk to the small group of <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> members who are <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> delegates, expresed chagrin that the vice president did not seek the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s endorsement nor grant her request for a private meeting. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not alone. Most of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s former rivals also declined to fill out the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s political questionnaires or sit for a videotaped interview by <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>. The union has been an ardent backer of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate in every election since 1976, and an implacable foe of the education and budget policies of the Reagan-Bush administration. Calling hers `` a bipartisan organization,'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said, `` I believe that there is a broad common ground between NEA and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' She said the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> supports the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s calls for high standards and improved accountability for schools, teachers and students; for a greater emphasis on religious and moral values; and for more attention to the needs of disadvantaged students. She did n't mention some other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform positions _ including support for merit pay, tuition tax credits and home schooling _ that her union opposes. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> endorsed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the Democratic presidential nomination a few weeks before the Democratic convention. It is waiting until Sept. 8 to make a formal endorsement for the general election, after canvassing the 8,400 <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> delegates who attended its convention here last month. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>, which boasted nearly 300 Democratic delegates and 92 alternates in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, has 25 of its members among the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates, plus nine alternates, according to a preliminary tally. The 1.9 million-member union, which estimates that 600,000 of its members are Republicans, is giving each delegate $ 1,000 to defray convention expenses.

 A small group of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> military observers left for the front Sunday to prepare for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force that will monitor a cease-fire in the war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The team from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> was expected to return to the Iranian capital Monday after checking logistical needs for the peacekeepers. A diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the location of the border is not expected to cause major negotiating problems. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers' `` primary job will be to make sure that no one violates the truce,'' the source said. Forces of both countries are now positioned along the border as hammered out in a 1975 treaty. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants the cease-fire agreement to be based on that treaty, the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> Accords, which gave them half of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has repudiated that agreement, and the struggle for control over the waterway helped start the fighting in September 1980. The Shatt-al-Arab, the delta of the <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> rivers, is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the sea at the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on July 18 accepted a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted soon after it was passed in July 1987. The cease-fire is to begin officially on Aug. 20. U.N. Resolution 598 said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force is to `` to verify, confirm, and supervise the cease-fire and withdrawal'' to `` internationally recognized borders.'' An informed source who spoke on condition of anonymity said Turkish, Finnish and Swedish representatives are expected to join the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> advance team on Monday. Military representatives from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> are already in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A similar team is working in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The advance team is laying groundwork for a 350-member unarmed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force to monitor the border while the two countries hold direct talks, set to begin Aug. 25. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said Sunday his nation forced <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into agreeing to a truce by defeating it on the battlefield. He also called on his people to redouble efforts to rebuild post-war <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` The decision of peace was taken by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and not by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, nor by the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- secretary-general -LRB- <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> told his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in an address shown on state-run television. `` We believed right from the beginning that peace could not be achieved unless <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wins the battle,'' he said. `` And <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> won the battle when it rendered <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> incapable of continuing the war.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of the cease-fire followed defeats by Iraqi troops, who recaptured the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, the Majnoon islands and land near the southern port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. In a related development, <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted Iranian President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as saying Sunday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would not accept any alterations in Resolution 598. `` It is possible that the aggressor enemy, which follows no principle, will try to change the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution. But we insist that we will not accept any change in the articles of the resolution, not even a word,'' he said. The president spoke to a group of troops manning anti-aircraft batteries along the southern front. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> told the troops that despite the expected end of the war, they should remain alert.

 Several Soviets who floated down the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on a cruise for peace were invited to help Republicans welcome President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the GOP convention Sunday. Forty-eight Soviets and 125 Americans rode the Delta Queen paddlewheeler from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on a nine-day <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Peace Cruise. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gave the group tickets for 15 of the Soviet participants to attend a rally for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the Superdome. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s assessment of its record and relationship with the Soviets should be good because there have been substantial achievements,'' said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Drozdov </PERSON> as he left the steamboat. `` Now my main interest is, how does the party see the future?'' <PERSON> Drozdov </PERSON>, a researcher of nuclear disarmament in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, said he was eager to watch the convention delegates' `` self-expression'' at what he expected to be an emotional, spirited gathering `` We, too, have our self-expression, but this is a curious thing,'' he said. The Soviets ate lunch at <ORGANIZATION> Chez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helene </ORGANIZATION>, a soul food restaurant that's the model for television's `` Frank's Place.'' They were staying in the rollicking French Quarter, and <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Woodmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who organized the peace cruise, said they expected a full night of indulgence. `` They are a fun-loving group.

<TEXT>
 Drought-plagued farmers in search of livestock feed are turning to cannery waste and used grains from breweries in increasing numbers. `` This year we have waiting lists for customers, are totally sold out and even had to trim our customer list,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who works for <ORGANIZATION> Miracle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Onalaska </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The feed company hauls malted barley and corn grits from brewery plants and stores the perishable grain before delivery to farmers, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Friday. The cooked malted grain and cannery wastes _ sweet corn husks and cobs and bean and pea plant ends _ can be fed to cows by farmers trying to cut their bills for corn and other grains. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the used grain is cheaper _ about $ 20 a ton _ than some other feeds with similar nutrition. Used brewery grain may have between 24 percent and 32 percent crude protein when dry, he said. `` It's a really good feed,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shibilski </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewery </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stevens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, which also has been getting calls from farmers looking for wet grain. Last week, agriculture officials released harvest forecasts predicting <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s corn harvest would be down 52 percent compared with last year and oats will be down 60 percent. With smaller harvests and higher grain prices, there also seems to be more interest in vegetable processing waste, said <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> agriculture agent. `` I have several farmers now feeding potato waste,'' he said. `` They -LRB- farmers -RRB- are looking for more ways to get through'' the drought. Before rains turned <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> fields green in the past few weeks and raised hopes for a third hay cutting, cannery operators said they noticed an increase in the number of farmers asking about bean, corn and pea waste. `` There's a lot more interest in it than there's been in the past,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> operations in Plover, where waste is available free. Some canneries, like <ORGANIZATION> Stokely </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>'s Sun Prairie operations, have contracts with farmers who take the waste away from the cannery. `` One year, you ca n't give the stuff away and other years, you've got people fighting for it,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangus </PERSON>, raw products manager for <PERSON> Stokely </PERSON>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation ended three days of talks with Jordanian leaders Sunday and officials said they agreed that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> would take no further measures to abolish its influence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> also reasserted its desire for confederation with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> after a Palestinian state has been established. A senior Palestinian leader was quoted in a Paris-based weekly as saying the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is leaning toward establishing a provisional government in the Israeli-occupied territories instead of a government-in-exile. The newspaper Journal du Dimanche quoted <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, deputy chairman of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> wing, as saying in an interview that the decision on a provisional government might be taken at a meeting next month of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the organization's legislature. The <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> meetings were the first high-level discussions between Jordanian and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials since King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision two weeks ago to renounce <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s claim to sovereignty over the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> also canceled a $ 1.3 billion <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> development plan, ended payments to thousands of civil servants in the occupied territories and suspended the lower chamber of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s parliament. Half of the members of the lower House were from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The king said he was turning over to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> full responsibility for the occupied territories. But a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> statement issued Sunday night in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> indicated the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> did not want further Jordanian moves to remove its influence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. The statement said `` both sides came to agreement that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> will provide all facilities and measures that serve the interests and the life of our people in the occupied territories.'' <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Executive Committee member <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Horani </PERSON> told reporters Sunday night that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> will continue to keep open the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bridges to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, will continue to issue Jordanian passports to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents and will maintain its oversight of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools. Most of the 850,000 Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and many of the 650,000 Palestinians in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> hold Jordanian passports. A majority of the 2.8 million residents of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> are from families who fled from <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> in the 1948 and 1967 wars with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> statement said <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> made clear that people of Palestinian origin `` have full rights of citizenship'' but also would retain `` their rights in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> ... including the right to repatriation and self-determination.'' Referring indirectly to tensions caused by <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s break with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> said it `` expressed deep concern for the stability of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and its national unity.'' It restated its call for an eventual Palestinian confederation with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Horani </PERSON> said said that would occur only after a Palestinian state `` is established on the ground.'' Palestinian officials here confirmed the statements by <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> that creation of a provisional government might be considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Horani </PERSON> said no date for the council session has been set, although it is supposed to be held this month or early next month in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. Palestinian leaders have suggested a provisional government would strengthen their indirect recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, but Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has rejected the idea of talks with any such government. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also has said it would not permit the formation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the occupied territories. `` For 25 years, the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> refused to talk peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and now it's <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> which says ` No,''' <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> told the Journal du <PERSON> Dimanche </PERSON>. `` My solution for peace is a Palestinian state, a discussion to establish the borders of this state and mutual recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>,'' he was quoted as saying. He said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was `` thinking seriously of creating a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state with a provisional government, legitimately established, whose political program would be completely different from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s current charter.'' That charter has been a major block to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Israeli talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> because it calls for the elimination of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 It is Sunday morning on the day before the Republican National Convention and in the cool confines of the Cathedral of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalbano </PERSON> invokes God's blessing for the coming gathering in the Superdome `` We want to thank you for joining us from everywhere,'' says <PERSON> Montalbano </PERSON>. `` Do n't wait for the next Republican convention to come and see us.'' He judiciously avoids anything that might be construed as partisan. `` Catholics are from everywhere,'' he says. `` That's what being Catholic is about.'' The cathedral, the oldest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, is on <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in the French Quarter. The square is marked with a new sign declaring it `` Place <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Deux </PERSON>,'' a reminder that the pope worshipped there during his visit last year. In fact, there is a kneeler on the left side of the altar used by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and no one else. Outside the cathedral, Dr. Love is hanging his paintings on the iron fence enclosing the park on Jackson Square. Each painting uses the word `` Love'' in some manner: in the shape of buildings, of shrubbery, as geometric shapes. He is hoping Republicans will find the message appealing. His best seller, he says, is a painting that spells the word right side up or upside down, in blue for males and pink for females. The painting is hung so it will rotate easily and Dr. Love _ he's really M.T. <LOCATION> Hol-U-Bar </LOCATION> _ explains a complicated ritual for which side is up that sends a message from one partner to the other. Sideways, he says, is a symbol of neutrality which is usually the way he feels about political parties, except of course this week. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, this week, everybody loves the Republicans. Cabdrivers love them, restaurant owners love them, and shopkeepers love them. There is even nostalgia for a Republican reviled in the past. A popular T-shirt bears the legend `` Tanned, Rested and Ready: <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in'88.'' A man who sculptures balloons, who says his name is simply `` Clown'' when he is at work, is specializing this week in elephant trunks. `` What does everybody from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have in common??'' he asks. `` They have their nose in government.'' It's only 9 a.m. but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Square already is steamy. Delegates, seemingly early risers, are strolling about. You can tell that they are delegates because they already are wearing tags around their necks, even though it's a day early. The painters who display their wares against the <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> fence every day are in the spirit of the week. One has a portrait of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in a gallery that also includes <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Another displays one of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, looking as he did about 20 years ago. In the sun-splashed Cafe du Monde, Republicans from out of town are performing a delectable <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> ritual, drinking chicory coffee and eating beignets _ those square, sugar-powdered confections that compare to doughnuts as steak does to meat loaf. Outside two sidewalk musicians are entertaining. On the trombone one plays a jazz rendition of `` Let Me Call You Sweetheart.'' It seems an appropriate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> serenade to their visitors.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> closed the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and confined residents to their homes Sunday after widespread rioting in the occupied lands. Arab sources said 25 Palestinians were wounded and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said a firebomb thrown at a van burned six Israelis, including an infant. The wounded Israelis were among several families traveling to visit relatives at the Jewish settlement of <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dekalim </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Beit-Halachmi </PERSON>, spokesman for the Gush Katif Jewish settlement council. As the van passed the strip's Bureij refugee camp, one of a group of Arabs hurled a bottle filled with gasoline that broke through the vehicle's windshield, he said. An 8-month-old child was in critical condition with facial burns, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. It said three children ages 2, 8, and 11, and a teen-ager and an adult received light to moderate injures. Troops sealed the area and searched for suspects, the radio said. `` We had a meeting with the army tonight, and they promised to take a series of tough actions,'' <PERSON> Beit-Halachmi </PERSON> said. Also Sunday, the army said a 21-year-old <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> man died of wounds sustained during the weekend. The death brings to 243 the number of Arabs killed since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have died. The army's curfew on the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> means all 650,000 residents of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> will be confined to their homes indefinitely, a military spokesman said. Residents will be barred from traveling to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and journalists will be allowed into the area only if accompanied by a military official, the army said. It was the second time the entire <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> had been placed under curfew since the Palestinian revolt began. The army took a similar measure in March. Shopkeepers in the seaside strip opened their stores just after 8:30 p.m., enabling residents to stock up on food before the 10 p.m., when the curfew went into effect. The riots in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> apparently were triggered by the deaths of two Gazan workers who were burned while sleeping at an Israeli construction site near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> last week, local reporters said. Police have said Jewish extremists may have set the fire. Troops shot and wounded at least 21 Palestinians in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and four in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. The overall number was confirmed by hospital officials. The reporters said a 48-year-old <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> man lost an eye when he was hit by a rubber bullet. An army spokesman said he did not know of the eye injury and put the number of wounded at 13. The army announced the curfew after closing most of the 140-square-mile strip to outside visitors and restricting at least 187,000 residents to their homes throughout the day. Journalists were forced to leave the area, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. `` The curfew is to remain into effect until further notice,'' the army announcement said. `` Residents will not be allowed to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and residents coming back from work will be allowed to enter the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> only at hours set by the military government.'' At least half of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s residents commute daily to jobs in Israeli restaurants, factories and farms. ` The date at which the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> will be reopened to traffic will be decided upon according to circumstances,'' the army said. The statement said the measure was taken `` to undermine residents' readiness to respond to calls to engage in public disorder.'' Underground leaflets from Moslem fundamentalist groups called for demonstrations to coincide with the Islamic new year, 1409, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said they expected a new wave of unrest. Six of the shootings in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> took place in the Jabaliya refugee camp on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Two of those wounded were 18-year-olds who suffered gunshot wounds in the arms or legs, said officials at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shifa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION>. Other injuries occurred in the Shati refugee camp and the Sheikh <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tufah </LOCATION> neighborhoods of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Dowsers Say Drought Hasn't Brought Them Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EFFINGHAM, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The drought has n't flooded dowsers with work, and some say it's because people are skeptical of their powers to find water. `` I have n't had any calls and I'm surprised,'' said <PERSON> Dugie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, 42, one of 65 people who attended the Illianna Dowsers convention Saturday. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, an 18-year veteran of dowsing, and his fellow dowsers believe their skills help them find underground water, oil and other resources. Some also say they use dowsing for healing purposes. Some dowsers, who are sometimes called `` water witches,'' use pendulums, while others use reeds or forked branches. Still others say they have become so practiced at dowsing they can tell where water is without using an instrument. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said doubts about their powers may keep some people away. `` A lot of people are n't going to call because of that reason,'' said <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Edwardsville </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` But common sense tells me if I need water and someone can help, I'm going to take a shot at it. Right now I think a lot of people are afraid it's going to cost them too much to drill a well.'' Dowser <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>, 72, of nearby <LOCATION> Vandalia </LOCATION>, agreed price may keep people away. He said drilling a well can cost a minimum of several thousand dollars. <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>, however, says he has watched farmers come to <LOCATION> Vandalia </LOCATION>'s water treatment plant this summer to haul water with their trucks. `` For them to haul water is unnecessary because there is water on their land,'' <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> said. `` But a dowser will never push himself on anyone.'' <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> said has dowsed thousands of wells in 40 years, and said he has been wrong only once. <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> do n't charge for their water-searching services. `` If you want to have a well, call in a well driller and have them dig it. But if you want water in that well, you better put it where there's water,'' <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> said.

 Heavy rains pushed the two main branches of the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> over their banks Sunday, swamping huge sections of central <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and worsening a disaster that already has left 2 million people homeless, news reports said. The reports said the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION> and White Nile, which converge at <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> to form the Nile, were overflowing Sunday south of this capital city. Finance Minister <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Dayem </PERSON> told reporters Saturday the floods have killed at least 58 people, injured 213 and destroyed 167,000 houses in the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> area. Irrigation Minister <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Beshir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamma </PERSON> said damage was expected to extend from central and northern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> into Egyptian territory. An Egyptian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION>, in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, said in its Monday editions that the two Nile tributaries on Sunday spilled across a region south of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> `` until only tree tops remained visible.'' The <LOCATION> El-Gezira </LOCATION> district, in central <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> between the two branches of the Nile, is one of the country's richest agricultural zones. It produces cotton, a leading export, and a loss of the crop could prove disastrous <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s already faltering economy. For the past 10 days <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and other cities in central, eastern and northern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> have suffered floods caused by heavy rains that officials said are the worst in the country's history. More than 1,200 tons of relief supplies, including tents, medicine and food, have arrived in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> from donors worldwide, but <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> el-Dayem told a news conference in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> the aid is insufficient for the millions affected by the floods. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosovy </PERSON>, a member of the committee coordinating the relief operation, denied reports that aid was being withheld from some 750,000 people who fled the civil war and drought in southern <LOCATION> Sundan </LOCATION> and moved into squatter camps that ring <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. `` It just so happens that those living in outlying areas are inaccessible to those distributing food,'' <PERSON> Mosovy </PERSON> told reporters. Some journalists have said they saw no evidence of aid being distributed in the camps and there were reports of some supplies being diverted to the army. <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> el-Dayem denied that and said `` the army is giving its supplies to the people.'' Intestinal infections and diarrhea epidemics have broken out in many settlements from people drinking unclean water, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s representative told international relief agencies Saturday. Dr. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said cholera was an immediate risk, with outbreaks of malaria and typhoid expected within weeks. The U.N. Emergency Office in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> said more rains were forecast through August and into September.

 <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Geragandi </PERSON> <PERSON> Koko </PERSON> looked at the mounds of mud above the surface of water covering the flooded shanty town of <LOCATION> Jebel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kusha </LOCATION> _ Arabic for `` mountain of garbage. `` Seven thousand families lived where there now is water,'' said <PERSON> Koko </PERSON>, 32, a squatter in the northern <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> settlement of <PERSON> Jebel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusha </PERSON>. `` The government has brought no relief.'' The muddy mounds are all that remain of thousands of hovels destroyed since torrential rains began in central <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> on Aug. 4, leaving the desert capital of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> awash and sending the White Nile and <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION> rivers over their banks. Government officials have said 58 people have perished in the floods that destroyed some 167,000 houses and left up to 2 million people homeless. Authorities acknowledge that little has been accomplished so far in providing aid to the victims, but they blame insufficient supplies and the suddenness and scope of the catastrophe. `` In a matter of hours, towns and millions of people were submerged,'' <PERSON> Omer </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Din </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday. <PERSON> Jebel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusha </PERSON> was among the areas hardest hit. It is one of 23 squatter camps ringing <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> that hold an estimated 500,000 people who fled the civil war and drought in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and sought refuge in the capital. Many of the mud huts in <PERSON> Jebel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusha </PERSON> disintegrated under the rains, and the floods created a lake with knee-high waters that extends for more than a half mile from the settlement to the village of <LOCATION> Esba </LOCATION>. Women and children with plastic jugs and containers waded through the muddy lake to get to <LOCATION> Esba </LOCATION> where they begged for clean water. `` We have been suffering for the last 10 days,'' said <PERSON> Koko </PERSON>, acting as a spokesman for the 15,000 people at <LOCATION> Jebel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kusha </LOCATION>. `` Nobody has come. We are sick, we are hungry,'' he told a group of visiting journalists. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Din </PERSON> said relief would be provided for the refugees but supplies received so far met only a fraction of the need and were quickly used up. As of Saturday, 85 cargo planes mainly from Arab and Western nations had delivered 1,200 tons of emergency supplies including tents, blankets, medicine, four-wheel-drive vehicles and 400 tons of food, according to relief officials. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> estimates 12,000 tons of food is needed to help feed the flood victims for a month. It is helping coordinate the response by international relief agencies and there are reports the catasrophe could get worse. More rain is forecast for this month and into September.

 A <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> teen-ager who is one of youngest delegates to the Republican National Convention says he hopes to amend the party platform to reflect <PERSON> Mormon </PERSON> family values. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Densley </PERSON>, a freshman at Mormon Church-owned <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, wants a platform plank recommending that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families meet together weekly to discuss moral issues such as illicit drug use and avoiding sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS. At 18, <PERSON> Densley </PERSON> is the youngest of the 1,274 delegates surveyed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. More than 2,200 delegates are gathered in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for the convention, which opens Monday. The proposed plank would reflect a <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> program known as Family Home Evening, in which families are encouraged to get together on Monday nights for various activities, including religious instruction. <PERSON> Densley </PERSON> conceded that with the bulk of the platform work completed, his prospects for success are slim. <PERSON> Densley </PERSON> said he did n't think of his pro-family plank until after the committee began its work last week. `` What all of these social, moral issues have is a common starting point _ a lack of moral fiber,'' <PERSON> Densley </PERSON> said. `` What could turn the country around is a stronger emphasis on the family.'' `` It's not a religious issue per se. It could work wonders nationally,'' said <PERSON> Densley </PERSON>, the oldest of six children in a devout <PERSON> Mormon </PERSON> family that adheres to the Family Home Evening program. <PERSON> Densley </PERSON> graduated from high school only last June, and spent the summer in political science and pre-law at <ORGANIZATION> BYU </ORGANIZATION>. He said he ran for a spot in the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> delegation to prove that teen-agers can play a significant role in politics.

 About 30 youths hurled stones at an East German bus Sunday as it carried passengers through <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s airport, police said. The attack on the government-owned bus followed a day of commemorations on both sides of the city marking the 27th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police said no one was injured but that several bus windows were shattered. The bus, owned by the East German state airline <LOCATION> Interflug </LOCATION>, had picked up passengers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> who were to take flights from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Schoenefeld </LOCATION> airport, said a police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. Police were unable to catch the assailants, the spokesman said. On Saturday, protesters in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> hurled rocks, bottles, tomatoes, and eggs at East German soldiers stationed on the other side of the wall. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police arrested four protesters. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military authorities arrested two others who burned an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police said. No injuries were reported. On Saturday, West German newspapers marked the wall's anniversary, saying it should not exist Meanwhile, communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-controlled newspapers celebrated its construction and said it has contributed to East-West peace. East German border guards began hastily constructing the 13-foot wall on Aug. 13, 1961, dividing the city into Eastern and Western halves. Orders to construct the wall came as the rising flow of East German refugees to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> threatened to cripple the communist nation's economy. The August 13th Working Group, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> organization that monitors human rights in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, says 77 people have been killed in escape attempts from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Also Sunday, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> appealed to his nation to help the growing number of German-heritage immigrants arriving from the East bloc. Speaking on the <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said it was `` shameful'' that some West Germans resent the newcomers. `` This is money well-spent,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told an interviewer, referring to the millions of dollars spent to resettle the immigrants each year. Up to 200,000 German-stock people were expected to arrive in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year, compared to about 80,000 in 1987. The main reason for the increase is easing of immigration restrictions by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and some other East bloc countries.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made his entrance at the Republican National Convention Sunday riding in a Mardis Gras style parade and pledging `` every ounce of energy and every fiber of my being'' in support of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president. The president and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, rode into the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in an open antique touring car, preceded by marching bands, floats and an elephant. The crowd that jammed the convention center, standing on the concrete floor to hear the president, interrupted his speech with frequent cheers and applause. At the beginning of the speech the president was heckled from the back of the hall by a handful of protesters. They were evicted and their signs were taken down. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spent much of his speech deriding the Democrats, whom he said had become `` the party of ` no.''' `` They know what they intend to do once in office,'' the president said. `` But they do n't want the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to find out until after the election.'' `` The masquerade is over,'' he added. `` It's time to talk issues, to use the dreaded ` L' word, to say the policies of our opposition and the congressional leadership of his party are liberal, liberal, liberal.'' `` The party of ` yes' has become the party of ` no,''' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who was a Democrat until 1962. `` Four more years, four more years,'' the crowd chanted as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> walked onto the stage. Later, the Republicans chanted `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> got into his speech. He paused briefly, saying, `` That's right. That's his name.'' At the outset of his speech, he made several quips at the Democrats' expense. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he had something in common with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Without naming <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, he said, `` neither one of us shares the views of their presidential nominee.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also suggested he had something in common with Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whom he referred to only as `` their presidential nominee.'' `` Come this January, neither one of us will be holding a federal office,'' he said. Declaring that `` we never want to see the day when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is more interested in criminal rights than in the rights of the victim and society itself,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> predicted, `` The next president may have the opportunity to appoint three and possibly four new justices shortly after taking office.'' On foreign affairs, he said, `` What a great moment we have before us and oh how future generations will dishonor us if now in a moment of sudden folly we throw it all away.'' `` We must hold to this moment of hope _ and I tell you with every ounce of energy and every fiber of my being, only electing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can accomplish that.'' `` My fellow Republicans, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs the strength, vision and true grit of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' The speech was a preview of the one <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will make in prime time on opening night of the GOP convention Monday. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters on the flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> aboard Air Force One that the convention speech `` will focus on successes'' of the administration, including `` the president's policies on arms control and military strength.'' He said it will also contain `` some reminiscing.'' On Tuesday morning the president will speak at a closed breakfast for big contributors to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, arriving that day to claim the party's nomination, will cross paths with the president at <ORGANIZATION> Belle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chasse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. After remarks by both men, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> will be off to their 688-acre ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has spent 316 days since becoming president. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been increasingly active on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf as the convention neared with the vice president still lagging behind <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in public opinion polls. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> lunched with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and plans for the previously unscheduled airport meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> were announced. On Friday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> addressed Cabinet members and political appointees, the president saying, `` Frankly, I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want to gamble their future on a blind date. In his weekly radio speech on Saturday, the president continued to hammer at this theme, picturing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a candidate with a proven national record and saying of the Democrats, `` While they talk, we deliver.'' This will be <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s seventh Republican National Convention. He has attended every one since he switched his registration from Democratic in 1962. At the 1964 convention in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, he was an alternate delegate from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. After <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> won the nomination, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned for him with a strongly conservative speech that was his introduction to the national political arena. He first addressed a Republican convention in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in 1968, when <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was nominated. When <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was renominated in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> four years later, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presided over the convention. He has addressed every GOP convention since then, telling delegates in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1984 that this was `` the last time'' he would address such a gathering as a candidate.

 Orbiting space debris poses a threat to spacecraft and should be eliminated, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> scientist said Sunday. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, a project scientist at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, told an international conference exploring various forms of space pollution that a particle could strike and damage a spacecraft. The debris ranges in size from old non-functioning satellites and rocket boosters to nuts and bolts from disintegrating spacecraft. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> estimated that at least 48,000 objects one centimeter or larger are in orbit about the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, but told a Colloquium of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> that the true number is probably much higher. In June of 1983, a window of the space shuttle Challenger was replaced after being struck by a piece of orbiting debris that caused a small pit. Later, chemical analysis revealed the window had been hit by a fleck of paint no larger than one eight-thousandth of an inch in diameter. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> says such collisions involving the space shuttle are rare because of the vehicle's low orbit and the relatively short amount of time the shuttle spends in space. Longer space missions will require additional protection. `` The problem gets to be more severe for something like the space station, which is planned to be continuously there for 30 years,'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said. Shields are currently being designed to protect the crew from debris about one centimeter in diameter -- the size of a marble. `` The shields weigh an extra 2,000 pounds per module. There are six modules, so that's an extra 12,000 pounds of weight that are having to be put into orbit because of the orbital debris environment,'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said. A presidential directive now requires that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spacecraft be designed to minimize the creation of space debris. Future rocket boosters, said <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, will probably be designed to fall back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> estimated that redesigning boosters might increase their cost by 10 to 20 percent. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is not alone in recognizing the growing danger of space debris. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said a 1986 explosion of a spent Ariane rocket booster spewed 400 pieces of debris into orbit, an event that `` woke the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> up'' to the problem of orbital debris.

 Secret Service agents and police combed the vast <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superdome </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday to make sure it was safe and bomb-free before delegates to the Republican Convention descended on the arena. The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would say little about their role at the convention, except that its agents' first priority is to protect President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is to claim the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination this week. `` It's a tremendous task. There's a lot involved when you start talking about securing places, examining sites and allocating manpower,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, an agency spokesman. He declined to say how many agents have been assigned to the convention. A major task was completed Sunday, when the Superdome was evacuated for 1 -LCB- hours while agents and police with dogs checked for explosives. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said part of the arena, such as rooms that are not being used, were checked earlier, making the task easier. <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents also will keep an eye on convention protests, which are being staged six blocks away. `` We have to closely monitor them in case they become unruly and people start jumping fences,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said, referring to a 5,000-foot-long, 8-foot-high chain-link fence that was erected around the Superdome for the convention. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Police Lt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said work on the fence was completed Sunday and that a total of 110 officers will work eight-hour shifts around the clock during the convention. `` We're basically observers,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said. `` It's boring at times, stressful at times and very interesting. We've never had a close-up look at a convention like this before.'' Crowd control is nothing new to the police department, which must deal with up to 1 million visitors every year during the raucous Mardi Gras celebration. At the entrances to the Superdome, police officers and <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents will be stationed near X-ray machines and metal detectors.

 A peace activist broke a 63-day liquid-only fast _ one day for each million dollars allegedly spent on `` Rambo III'' _ by biting into a giant pizza with a pepperoni peace sign and delivering it to <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s door. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> campaigner against cinema violence and war toys, did n't see <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> but was more graciously received Saturday than in a previous visit to a <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> residence when someone squirted him with water over a wall.

Future rocket boosters, said <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, will probably be designed to fall back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> estimated that redesigning boosters might increase their cost by 10 to 20 percent. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is not alone in recognizing the growing danger of space debris. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said a 1986 explosion of a spent Ariane rocket booster spewed 400 pieces of debris into orbit, an event that `` woke the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> up'' to the problem of orbital debris.

 Supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday hailed the killing of a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldier in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> as a sign of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s strength. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, vice-president of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, told a rally in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>: `` It shows the ability of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> to bring about a final victory in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. We saw the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> battalions at work in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. They speak for us. They speak with one voice.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for killing Warrant Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heakin </PERSON>, who was shot to death Friday night as he drove his car to the ferry at <LOCATION> Ostend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. In May, <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas killed three British servicemen in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to unite <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province where Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2, with the mainly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON> spoke at a rally marking the 17th anniversary of the introduction of the British policy of interning guerrilla suspects without trial. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abandoned the policy in 1975. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a U.S.-based support group for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, pledged continued assistance. He told the rally, `` As long as you campaign against the British then we in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will support you.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Armed Forces Minister <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said recommendations have been made on whether <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> servicemen should continue to use special license plates. He did not say what the recommendations were, but said they would be given urgent consideration by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. There have been demands that the special `` British Forces'' license plates for British servicemen be replaced by British plates or plates from the country where they are serving. <PERSON> Heakin </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Moenchen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bladbach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, was shot by one of two men who approached his car when it stopped at a traffic light in <LOCATION> Ostend </LOCATION> where he planned to take the ferry to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Livsey </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> representing <PERSON> Heakin </PERSON>'s constituency in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, said the soldier `` had no chance in his private car with British Forces number plates The fact is that as long as these number plates remain, British servicemen will be sitting ducks to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>.''

<TEXT>
 A computerized toilet seat that lowers automatically, a talking smoke detector that tells people how to escape fires and a new version of the old push lawnmower were among 250,000 products on display Sunday at the National Hardware Show. The hardware show _ with 3,000 exhibits covering an area the size of 17 football fields _ is the biggest in its 43-year history and the country's largest trade show, said manager <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolson </PERSON>. About 70,000 retailers are expected to attend the four-day event at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> Place exposition center, she said. Biggest growth is among lawn and garden exhibitors, who are taking 40 percent more space than at last year's show, she said. `` Do-it-yourself people are moving the home improvement industry outdoors,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Dolson </PERSON>. `` It's a recreational thing for the yuppie generation, and we see tremendous growth in this area.'' Americans spent $ 17.4 billion on their lawns and gardens last year, a 23 percent increase over 1986, she said. Lawn mowers on display ranged from top-of-the-line Volvos _ a $ 5,000 riding lawnmower with four-wheel steering, from Swedish maker <ORGANIZATION> Husqvarna </ORGANIZATION> _ to the more humble $ 69 push mowers made by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mowers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shelbyville </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Teri </PERSON> <PERSON> McClain </PERSON>, a sale-representative for the family-owned American firm, said the push mower has returned with sales up 47 percent in the past two years, after a lightweight 17-pound model of the 50-year-old traditional design was introduced several years ago. `` Joggers and people into aerobics can get a workout while mowing the lawn,'' she said. `` It's the lawnmower for the new lifestyle.'' Other lawn and garden products on display at the four-day show included solar-powered patio lights made by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey-based </LOCATION> company, <ORGANIZATION> Synergy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and a nine-pound gas-powered set of hedge trimmers made by HomeLite. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schaumburg </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said do-it-yourselfers spent $ 52 billion at hardware, home center and building supply outlets last year, and the do-it-youself market is expected to grow by 12 percent annually, to total $ 100 billion by 1990. Overall, products displayed at the show included the practical and impractical, the humble and extravagant _ from high-tech gadgets to the simple ironing board, step ladder and trash can. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sansonetti </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, has invented the Vocalert, a computerized smoke detector that not only sounds an alarm signal but can offer instructions in a calm, authoritative voice. It has a built-in bilingual English-Spanish vocabulary of 100 words and phrases _ that can be programmed to tell people what to do to escape _ such as `` stay calm'' or `` drop to the floor,'' depending on the intensity of the fire, which its sensors pick up. `` It has an intelligence to it and is good for situations in which people are disoriented like children and the elderly,'' said <PERSON> Sansonetti </PERSON> said. `` It's going to eliminate the confusion for everyone.'' <PERSON> Sansonetti </PERSON> said about 1.2 million units are being produced. The product, which retails for $ 89.95, is being marketed by <ORGANIZATION> WHS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and should be in stores by mid-fall. Sometimes the efforts to build a better mousetrap yield mixed success. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiu </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Eletto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said he spent four years developing the `` intelligent computerized toilet seat.'' With a push of the button, the seat can automatically lift up and down, a fanning mechanism and charcoal filter removes odors, the temperature can be adjusted to warm the seat. It flushes automatically and self-cleans, and the seat lowers by itself after a man uses it. <PERSON> Chiu </PERSON> said the product does eliminate some age-old conflicts between men and women, but its retail price of $ 350 is discouraging buyers. `` We've discovered that it's too expensive for people,'' he said. `` At that price, I doubt if I'd buy it myself.''

<TEXT>
 If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made up his mind about a vice presidential running mate, he's not even telling his family, his eldest son said Sunday. `` Sphinx-like, I think, is the adjective describing him,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> delegate to the Republican National Convention. The vice president's wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, says she does n't even want to know her husband's choice. Calling herself the `` world's worst secret keeper,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said she has asked her husband not tell her about his choice for a running mate. `` I've kept secrets, but it's agony,'' she said. `` This time, I want to be surprised.'' With <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate having been clinched for months, the only suspense in the pre-convention proceedings has centered on who will be his choice for No. 2. But the younger <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, said his father simply has n't told anyone yet. `` I was with him all day yesterday. He never answered the question, which I kept asking: ` Who's your choice?''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he doubted whether the person selected will get much notice. `` The minute you tell the nominee anything, it's over. He's -LRB- the elder <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- been in this game long enough to know that if you want it out, you tell the nominee. If you do n't want it out, you do n't tell anybody That's the way he's going to play it.''

 Ex-Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> declared himself `` just sort of a normal delegate from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'' as he arrived here for the Republican national convention, but the turmoil caused by his prolonged recall and impeachment battle still made him the center of attention at a Sunday reception. Other <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> delegates said they hoped to unify behind <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and forget the party's disarray at home. State Republicans `` did n't come here to expose the differences within the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>,'' said state party chairman <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruglick </PERSON>. `` This is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. This is national,'' said delegate <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Camp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. `` We've left anything that pertains to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> back in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.'' Some Arizonans suggested <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was convicted of high crimes and misdemeanors, might want to mend fences with his chief rival in the state party, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, who called for <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s resignation in January A few months ago, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> struck back, saying <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> lacked honesty and integrity and was not qualified for vice presidential consideration. On Sunday, however, the former governor said he would be in the Superdome on Monday to hear <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>'s address to the opening night session. `` He's getting a good spotlight and I'm happy for him,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyl </PERSON>, who was among the congressmen who sought <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s resignation in January but is not a delegate, suggested some accommodation might be in order for the former governor. `` Obviously a person who has been as contentious as he has been ought to be working to improve his relationships,'' <PERSON> Kyl </PERSON> said. `` But he's his own man. I'm not going to give him advice.'' <PERSON> Zane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who helped lead <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, predicted the state delegation would take a break this week from the intraparty battle. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> could play a major part in the growing conservative movement, he said, adding, `` If the infighting continues, there wo n't be that opportunity.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> guarded his vice presidential deliberations Sunday, while one of his prospective running mates said he did n't want the job and others acted like they were auditioning for it. Bashing Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the order of the day for Sens. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ all on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list of potential vice presidents. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, a close <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> friend who also was on the list, said `` I would be a liability,'' and disclosed he had asked the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be to drop him from consideration. But another name popped up again for consideration _ former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. Republicans outside of the campaign are urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to take another look at the former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leader, a source said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was at the vice presidential residence in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and keeping his own counsel on his deliberations on a running mate. He had lunch with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who is slated to take command of his presidential campaign, and worked on his acceptance speech. Even top aides, who have conferred regularly with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, disclaimed any knowledge of whether he was leaning toward one prospect or another. `` He'll probably tell us maybe 10 minutes before you find out,'' campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> told reporters in the Superdome, where the Republican National Convention will convene on Monday. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said there was no change in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to keep his choice a secret until Thursday morning. The convention will go through the formality Wednesday night of naming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the GOP presidential nominee. The names mentioned most frequently were <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and his wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Former Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, also among the mentioned, was in the convention city for only a few hours to address a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governors. Asked if he were on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said, `` No one's told me. If I'm on anyone's list, it's a list no one's told me about.'' He said he has had no communication from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or his aides about the vice presidency. The Doles were guests of honor at a reception and they told reporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides asked both of them last week for additional background information. <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, late arrivals in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Sunday, were immediately plunged into the running-mate maelstrom. `` I really am not out trying to get the job,'' <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> told reporters, adding he has n't heard from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign `` for maybe a week ... My guess is that I'm really a long shot still.'' `` There's not a dime's worth of difference'' philosophically among the hopefuls, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I think we'll just enjoy ourselves and wait for the big announcement.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> decided this weekend to come to the convention Monday to be on hand for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s farewell speech that night. The selection of someone to fill the No. 2 spot on the ticket was the only suspense at the convention and conservatives were actively lobbying to get one of their own in that spot. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, appearing on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> show `` Meet the Press,'' said, `` If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chooses some establishment Republican as his running mate, we will have something much worse than a gender gap, we will have a conservative gap.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> expressed reservations about <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and said the most acceptable people being talked about were <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> senator also said that `` On Friday of next week when all of this is settled, I'm going to be supporting the ticket.'' `` My record is just as conservative as Senator <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> when asked about the criticism of his record. `` Senator <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s influence is not widespread,'' he added. Conservative opposition to <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> was based on the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> senator's positions on abortion and taxes. `` I've had a very checkered career,'' said <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, during an interview on `` Meet the Press.'' `` I've punched the lights out of a lot of sacred cows. ... I would be a liability for <PERSON> George </PERSON>.'' On taxes, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> suggested he believes the next president may be forced to ask for a tax increase to deal with the deficit. `` Good lord, somebody is going to have to do something in that area or we'll be off the wall,'' he said. In separate talk show appearances, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> concentrated on criticizing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, an activity that would be at the top of the agenda for whoever becomes the vice presidential nominee. Interviewed from <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> show, `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` stands for a party in retreat. It stands for a party of doom and gloom. They do n't have an agenda for the future.'' As for his own prospects for being on the ticket, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` I would like to believe that I would be acceptable to the whole party.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` I'm not running for vice president.'' In a joking reference to his wife, the senator said, `` I'm not campaigning for anyone, but she would be a great addition to the ticket.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> brushed off his attacks on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when they were competing for the presidential nomination. `` Obviously in the primaries, I was not talking about his strengths,'' said the Kansan. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said it was `` very flattering'' to be mentioned but, `` I have a job to do for this president -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- and until I've heard anything from the vice president, I'm ready to go to work as attorney general of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was sworn in to his new post on Friday. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said, `` He will make a good attorney general,'' when asked about <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. When asked if he were saying <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, a former governor of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, was not under consideration, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said, `` I did n't say for how long.''

 Inmates angry over heat and crowded conditions set fire to a county jail Sunday, destroying one wing of the pre-Civil War building. At least eight people were injured. Prisoners at the <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> pelted firefighters and police with cans and debris as flames poured through the roof of the jail during the three-hour uprising. Two prisoners tried to escape but were caught before leaving the grounds, authorities said. `` Cops got hit, firefighters got hit,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> fire Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` They threw pipes _ long pipes, I do n't know where they got them from _ bricks, bottles.'' About 100 prisoners were moved from the destroyed east wing of the 144-year-old jail to an outdoor recreation area, where some tried to climb fences before they were contained by a phalanx of riot police, authorities said. Tear gas was used to subdue the inmates, authorities said. <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Special Sheriff <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> said 250 inmates were being housed at the jail, about twice its official capacity. The jail is not air-conditioned, and temperatures in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area Sunday climbed into the 90s. About noon, a group of inmates set a small fire in the gymnasium that was quickly extinguished. But about 1 p.m., a second fire broke out that raged for 1 -LCB- hours, destroying a shingled roof over the east wing of the cross-shaped, three-story granite building. At least eight people were injured, including five inmates and one firefighter who were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Methuen </LOCATION>, authorities said. Hospital officials said they were being treated for smoke inhalation and cuts. The jail predominantly houses prisoners convicted of misdemeanors with maximum terms of up to 2 -LCB- years, officials said. Among the inmates were 31 federal prisoners awaiting trial who are kept in the facility under contract with the federal government, <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> said. Inside the jail yard, about 20 inmates, many clad only in shorts, chanted `` food'' and `` unfair treatment'' to about 500 spectators who filled a park adjacent to the jail in this city of 60,000 located 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. State police Trooper <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McPhail </PERSON> said inmate visitation rights recently had been revoked because of unspecified problems, which may also have been a cause for the uprising. About 300 police and firefighters from at least eight cities and towns were called to the disturbance. The police entourage numbered more than 200 state, county and local officers, including two squads of helmeted riot police, authorities said. During the blaze in the gymnasium, which was set with paper and other debris, inmates watching from their cells pelted firefighters with cans and squirted them with shaving cream, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. About 100 firefighters were dispatched to the jail to fight the second, larger fire. Riot police were called in after firefighting efforts were hampered by the hail of debris, and the blaze was under control about 2:30 p.m, officials said. About 35 of the jail's 127 cells were destroyed and virtually all the others suffered smoke and water damage or other damage, officials said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fair </PERSON>, head of the state's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION>, said his agency was looking for a place to house 110 to 140 inmates displaced by the fire. The fire `` certainly puts a tremendous strain on an already overcrowded system,'' Fair said. The state is planning a new facility in nearby <LOCATION> Middleton </LOCATION> to replace the Lawrence jail, said state Human Services Secretary <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, the state's top prison official. The Lawrence prison, he added, `` is one of the oldest in the country, and it's a very bad facility. That's the reason we should get this going as quickly as possible.'' Prison overcrowding has been a chronic problem in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> at state and county facilities. Legislation giving the state control of county facilities has been stalled in the state Legislature for at least two years.

But he made it clear that he would relish the opportunity to run against Democrats <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` I'm concerned about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> taking over a country that's really on the way to a real recovery from a period of enormous stagnation,'' he said. `` I know a lot about the American economy and the world economy. I think I could dispel some of the very strange notions the Democratic nominee is making about the new era of prosperity he might bring.'' <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> was asked what his liabilities would be as a vice presidential candidate. `` I'm from a very small state. We do n't have very many electoral votes. I'm not very well known. I've always thought <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was the logical vice presidential nominee, and he's been through it -LRB- before -RRB-,'' he said. But he added, `` I speak a little Spanish. I'm ethnic. I'm Italian I'm an immigrant's son, both mother and father born in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. I speak that language and I speak Spanish. ... Those are the kinds of things that might give me a chance.'' Asked if the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has been in touch with him, <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said, `` No, I have n't heard anything from them for maybe a week. I heard some of my friends on TV this morning. I do n't know what that means. Most of them have n't heard anything, either. I think he's told us he is n't going to tell anybody anything until Wednesday. `` My guess is that I'm really a long shot still,'' <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said.

 Leaders of two major opposition groups held protest rallies on Sunday, the day before the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> begins ratifying returns from the bitterly contested July 6 elections. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, presidential candidate of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, claimed there was widespread vote fraud and called on President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> to oversee the nullification of the July balloting and set new elections for May 1990. He made the proposal in a letter to the president and released the text at a midday rally at the Independence Monument. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> then led a march to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s main downtown plaza, where police estimated the crowd at about 15,000. <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, presidential candidate of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, repeated his demand that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> release a breakdown of votes from individual polling stations. He spoke at a rally in <LOCATION> Juchitan </LOCATION> in the southern state of <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION>. Last week, <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> filed a criminal complaint against two commission officials, saying the commission had violated the electoral code by failing to release results from 24,642 voting stations, nearly half the national total. `` Those who form the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> must also know that there is a people waiting for its resolutions _ who voted on July 6 against imposition, corruption and violence, who voted for democracy and for a lawful regime and who will not permit abuses or humiliations,'' he said Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> is to meet through Aug. 31, and the opposition groups are expected to continue their almost daily protest rallies. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, in the letter to <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION>, urged the president to ask all political parties to participate in a what he called a `` Patriotic Conciliation and Electoral Legality Pact.'' He said participants would instruct their delegates in the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> to vote to nullify the elections and appoint an interim president to take office on Dec. 1, when de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> steps down at the end of his six-year term. New elections then would be held in May 1990, he said. `` It is possible that the presidential election ... could be declared legal, but it wo n't be considered linked to justice by the majority of the electorate,'' <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> said. Demonstrators shouted `` Maquio, Maquio,'' <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>'s childhood nickname, and waved the party's blue-and-white flags at the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> rally. Some carried papier-mache effigies of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, the candidate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Both the left and right accuse the government and the governing party, which has held power since 1929, of widespread fraud during the balloting and vote tabulations. Official results announced a week after the election gave <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> 50.36 percent of the vote, <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> 31.12 percent and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> 17.07 percent. The opposition plans demonstrations outside the Legislative Palace when the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, serving as the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, meets on Monday. Parties also have called on residents to protest with 15-minute blackouts at 8 p.m. every evening while the sessions last. The college meets through the end of the month to review the results and formally declare the winner. Reeling from its smallest margin of victory ever in a presidential race, along with congressional losses and the opposition's refusal to concede, the 59-year-old governing party has pledged reforms and defended the election process. `` In these days, the confrontations could grow,'' <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. In an apparent warning to the opposition, he said basic agreements among the parties were possible, but respect for decisions of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> `` should be part of any widely accepted agreement.'' Representatives of the governing party and the two main opposition parties have signed a joint declaration saying that orderly demonstrations would be allowed and no special security would be needed. The left-leaning newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION> praised the agreement as `` contributing substantially to resolving what was beginning to become a conflict.'' The Chamber of Deputies has 300 seats filled by direct election and 200 assigned according to the proportion of the vote received. On Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> assigned the proportional seats, giving the governing party a total of 247 and opposition parties 227. Certificates on 13 seats for the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were withheld pending resolution of challenges.

 A cabin cruiser exploded about 30 feet from a lake shore, killing a 5-year-old boy and burning five other people, three critically, authorities said. The 26-foot boat's motor stalled shortly after it was launched into <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> Saturday afternoon. As the boaters tried to restart the motor, gas fumes ignited a fireball that quickly engulfed the boat. `` It was completely ablaze from bow to stern.

Lifeguard <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, 19, dragged two women ashore. `` I rushed down there and saw one little girl burned, sitting on the dock. I looked out and saw a guy who was trying to stay up and keep another lady afloat.

 In broad daylight and in <LOCATION> mid-Manhattan </LOCATION>, the busiest part of the nation's busiest city, police say they have seen a marked upswing in especially brazen robberies on the crowded streets. `` We have gangs of people and they swarm like locusts,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scantlebury </PERSON>, a 23-year veteran. `` They will come up to a field of wheat _ which is three tourists _ and pick them dry. Then the swarm will move along.'' One such crime on July 27 made headlines. The <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, was standing outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patrick </LOCATION>'s Cathedral at 5 p.m. when a 22-year-old man with a pistol jumped out of a car and demanded their video camera. The bandit was shot to death when, in trying to flee, he tried to commandeer a car driven by an off-duty correction officer. `` As soon as I heard about that one, I thought, ` He must be crazy on crack,''' said Lt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robbery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squad </ORGANIZATION>. The highly addictive form of cocaine is blamed for many of the thefts. The proximity of the <ORGANIZATION> Martinique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, one of the city's homeless hotels, also is a contributing factor Within blocks of the <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>, affluent shoppers browse in <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and other stores. `` You have a lot of teen-agers with nothing to do with their time. They've been plopped into the middle of midtown, wealth, money and they have nothing,'' the sergeant said. `` We have more people coming of age; robbery is a young crime,'' <PERSON> Scantlebury </PERSON> said. `` You rarely find a 43-year-old doing street robberies. They're not as fleet of foot.'' Each day, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> offers thieves a potpourri of prey. Thousands of commuters engulf the island to work and shop, and tourists keep on coming; last year, 17.8 million tourists came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and the numbers are running about the same for 1988, according to the Convention and <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's like fishing in a stocked lake,'' <PERSON> Scantlebury </PERSON> said. `` There are more people. As a result there are going to be more victims and a greater chance of a guy getting away.'' Robberies in the first three months of 1988 were up more than 13 percent, from 835 in the first quarter of 1987 to 950, in <LOCATION> Midtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Precinct </LOCATION>, bordered by 29th and 45th Streets, after a 9 percent increase in 1987, according to police figures. Robberies in <LOCATION> Midtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Precinct </LOCATION>, bordered by 45th and 59th streets, are up 10 percent, from 397 in 1987's first quarter to 437 this year, after a 2 percent decrease last year. To combat the problem, more uniformed police are being deployed on foot patrol. And when members of the robbery squad are not investigating cases, they are assigned to keep an eye on the streets. But despite a heavy police presence in the area, `` Times Square is going nuts,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` We go by there late at night; we shudder when we see these unsuspecting tourists coming out of the theater at 11, 12 o'clock at night. They're just walking statistics.'' Street thieves sometimes use wheels. Bicycles are favored because they allow a quick getaway even in congested traffic, and a thief can blend in with the city's ubiquitous bicycle messengers. `` They've become so sophisticated they transport their bikes into <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> in the body of a truck,'' <PERSON> Scantlebury </PERSON> said. When they reach their base, usually in <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, `` they put the bikes in the truck and drive away,'' escaping police who are looking for suspects on bikes. Then there are thieves who follow victims out of banks and onto the crowded streets, striking suddenly, without a word, punching them in the face and grabbing their money. Only two of them have been arrested since the ring began its operations more than a year ago, and prosecution is difficult because most victims ca n't identify their attacker. For many crimes against tourists, punishment is uncertain. `` The bad guys know that if you rob a tourist, he's not going to be around to be a witness,'' <PERSON> Scantlebury </PERSON> said.

 A West German businessman held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has asked his country to free <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> in exchange for his own release, a magazine said Sunday. The magazine Quick released what it said was a letter <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> wrote to the West German government. The letter is to be published in its Wednesday edition. Quick said <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' wrote in his undated letter: `` More than a year and a half has already passed. My health worsens steadily. A doctor has been here to see me many times. People are very nice to me here. So why ca n't <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> be set free? What has he done against <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>?'' The letter, according to Quick, was written in German and signed `` A desperate West German.'' <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, 53, was kidnapped Jan. 17, 1987, after arriving in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as manager of the West German chemical concern <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>. West German security sources said he was being held by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization for Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Quick also quoted <PERSON> Abdel-Kadar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahraoui </PERSON>, an Algerian middleman it says delivered the letter, as saying the kidnappers are no longer demanding that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> be traded for <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sahraoui </PERSON> was reported as saying that <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' captors are now demanding that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> blame <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. The magazine said it did not know why <PERSON> Sahraoui </PERSON>'s statements contradicted <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' letter. It speculated that <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' captors had not yet told him they were no longer demanding an exchange with <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. Quick did not say how it learned the contents of <PERSON> Cortes </PERSON>' letter. The West German government confirmed on Aug. 4 that it received a letter from <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, but has refused to disclose what he wrote. <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Strempel </PERSON>, a government spokesman, said he could not comment on the magazine report, saying that has been the standard government procedure as long as <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was held hostage. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is on trial in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on charges of air piracy and murder in the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, in which a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has admitted in court that he was one of the hijackers, but denied killing the diver. A West German court in April convicted <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, of masterminding the kidnapping of <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and another West German, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, in an effort to force authorities to release <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> was sentenced to 13 years in prison. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was released in September 1987. Eighteen foreign hostages, including nine Americans, have been kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The longest held is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

 Residents of this small farming town and beyond crowded Sunday into the new Our Lady of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, built to replace the one destroyed in last year's tornado that killed 30 people. Bishop <PERSON> Raymundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peno </PERSON> dedicated the church as a shrine to the Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>, the first such shrine in the El Paso Roman Catholic Diocese. `` In the future, we hope this will become the center for spiritual growth in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said of the only church in the predominantly Hispanic town of about 350 people. `` They can come for spiritual retreats and for pilgrimages.'' The brown-and-gray brick structure was built on the site of the old cinder block church, which was leveled during the May 22, 1987, tornado. The new building, completed in late June, boasts classrooms, a dormitory and kitchen. The church's sanctuary is dominated by a blue-and-orange stained glass archway with a statuette of the Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> in the center. The church held a much larger crowd Sunday than the sanctuary's official capacity of 276, as lay representatives from every parish in the vast <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION> attended The crowd of about 600 spilled into the halls and outside as worshipers strained to hear. `` It's great to have the church back,'' said <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who lives a block west of the building. `` If we had a crowd like this every time, we'd have a pretty good town here.'' Last year's tornado destroyed about 40 houses. Many of the 30 people who were killed were attending a preschool graduation ceremony at a community center when the twister hit the structure with little warning. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Candelas </PERSON>, who grew up across the street from the church, said he rushed to <PERSON> Saragosa </PERSON> from his home in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> when he heard about the twister. He arrived about 3 a.m., eight hours after the tornado, he said. `` It was unrecognizable _ completely different,'' he said. `` I could n't find my parents' house.'' A little over a year later, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have rebuilt every house. A new community center with a 300-person capacity tornado shelter is a block from the church. `` It's definitely had an impact on the people _ tension, stress,'' <PERSON> Candelas </PERSON> said. `` Some people are very moody because they lost all they had and their loved ones. But it's getting better.''

 More than 1,000 activists insisted Sunday that `` blacks will not be slaves to a political party'' and cheered the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> record on minority appointments. But they conceded concern about holding a Republican National Convention with 92 percent white participants. `` We want to be critical without being antagonistic,'' said <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` The party has to do more than just sit back passively.'' `` That's what the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has to do, open up its doors,'' echoed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` The party has to have more blacks at all levels, at all echelons.'' A group called the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> held the dinner-reception to focus on the blacks, Hispanics and other minorities named to positions in the federal government. Organizers insisted that Republicans have a strong record to sell to minority voters and said Democrats are taking their votes for granted. `` You saw the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> make a statement that the black vote is simply there,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the group. `` This is not just a one-night arrangement, this is designed to be the kickoff of an ongoing effort,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't get any economic clout if you ca n't get a job.'' The event came on the eve of a GOP convention overwhelmingly dominated by whites, with fewer than 8 percent of the delegates coming from minorities, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey. That rankled many attending, but they insisted the best way to resolve the disparity was to work within the party. `` This is designed to let the convention know there are minorities who do support the ticket,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, businessman who organized the council. Questioned about the tiny number of blacks and other minorities represented on the convention floor, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said: `` I think that's basically the way things are There are not a lot of black Republicans.'' Others argued that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain nominee, has a strong record on civil rights issues and will lure black voters. `` We have perhaps a Republican presidential nominee with the greatest commitment to civil rights since <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an alternate from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` That's not to say there has been enough progress. By my reckoning, it ought to be 10 percent or 12 percent.''

 A carriage horse was temporarily overcome by heat Sunday and a running club changed its plans for a race for the first time in its history as the worst heat wave in decades continued to wrack the city. It hit 96 degrees at 4 p.m. _ the 31st day this summer that the temperature exceeded 90 degrees. The record of 37 days was set in 1944. Consolidated <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> also reported a record for Sunday electricity demand: 7,645 megawatts between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., breaking the record of 6,770 megawatts, set last Sunday. Spokesman <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Gitten </PERSON> said peak demand often occurs at that hour as people return home from weekend activities and turn on air conditioners and lights. A horse put to work pulling a carriage across the sizzling streets collapsed of apparent heat prostration but apparently suffered no lasting effects, the authorities said. The horse collapsed on a street on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s East Side shortly after noon. It lay for about 90 minutes before regaining enough strength to get into a trailer to be taken to its stable nearby, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapps </PERSON>, chief law-enforcement officer of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Horse-drawn sightseeing carriages are banned from city streets when the temperature tops 90 degrees. The temperature in Central Park hit 90 at noon, the weather service said. It had not been determined if the carriage driver would be ticketed, <PERSON> Kapps </PERSON> said. For the first time in its 30-year history, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Runners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> changed a road race through <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to a non-competitive `` fun run'' because of the oppressive temperatures, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, president of the club. `` When we announced the decision to run it as a ` fun run,' it was soundly booed,'' he said. However, by the finish of the 3.1-mile run, many of the more than 1,000 participants applauded his judgment, he said. The decision was prompted in part by the deaths of two young men who collapsed and died after running separate 3 -LCB- - mile races in sweltering heat earlier in the summer, <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said Officials said the two men, who were participating in corporate team competitions, were not in proper shape to be running. None of the runners in Sunday's event suffered any ill effects from the heat and humidity, <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> and the city's <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has been roasting for six weeks, enduring what <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadomski </PERSON>, a meteorologist at <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, called the worst heat wave since the mid-1950s.

 Five gay activists were arrested Sunday after a shoving incident during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s welcoming speech on the eve of the Republican National Convention, police said. The five were carrying signs criticizing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's AIDs policy, and their supporters said they were attacked by people in the crowd. The demonstrators were booked for disturbing the peace. The same charge was lodged against three members of an organization called <ORGANIZATION> Anarchist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in a separate incident at 2 a.m. Saturday. The group asserted police roughed up the men as they were distributing leaflets against racism and white supremacy. Police Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said the three were fighting among themselves and were arrested after they refused to stop and one kicked an officer. Other demonstrations went off peacefully, including a parade of feminists and a `` kiss-in'' at which protesters surrounded Roman Catholic Archbishop <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON> and shouted complaints about church policy on homosexuality. Police spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryson </PERSON> said the incident during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appearance occurred when about 10 demonstrators with the gay rights group Act Up began shoving people and punches were thrown He identified them as <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rexroad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benlevi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quefter </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kight </PERSON>, who identified himself as a gay activist from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, denied the demonstrators shoved anyone. `` A group of young men physically attacked them,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> tried to intervene to protect them, but the police arrested them.'' In the incident at Jackson Square involving the archbishop, the demonstrators staged a homosexual kiss-in at which men and women walked around in a long oval, kissing as they passed. `` We kiss in an aggressive demonstration of affection,'' said a statement read through a bullhorn. `` We kiss to protest the cruel and painful bigotry that affects the lives of lesbians and gay men. We kiss so that all who see us will be forced to confront their homophobia.'' At the Democratic Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, a similar `` kiss-in'' started a shoving match between gay demonstrators and police. But the Big Easy's officers just stood back and watched. `` That's what we are here _ easy going,'' said Officer <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. Some of the 40 to 50 demonstrators surged around <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON> after he came out of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cathedral </LOCATION> to shake hands with parishioners between the 10 and 11 o'clock masses. `` We're used to demonstrations. <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> is where everything happens,'' <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON>, resplendant in green and gold vestments, told a man in a Sunday suit. Just behind <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON>, two men in an extended clinch held a sexually explicit sign above his head. `` All I can say is God bless you,'' <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON> said when asked for comment. He said the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> was the first group in the state to open a hospice for patients of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, with another to open soon. While this was happening, about 150 women representing 20 feminist groups gathered at <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> at the other end of the French Quarter. Many climbed into 13 mule-drawn carriages and paraded with a Dixieland band. Like people in any other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> parade, the group threw beads to the crowd. They also threw small cups bearing the single sentence of the Equal Rights Amendment and plastic `` doubloons'' with the legend `` ERA YES'' in white on green. A children's advocacy group tossed fortune cookies; the slips inside read, `` The children of today are the leaders of tomorrow. Speakers exhorted the crowd to political action. `` We are here to tell the world that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has turned its back on women's rights,'' said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. `` But this does not let the Democrats off the hook. ... They will at their peril ignore women's issues. She told the group to keep an eye on what the Republicans and Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and others in his party do on women's issues.

<HEAD>Border Patrol Reports 35 Salvadorans Locked inside Sweltering
Boxcar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Thirty-five dehydrated Salvadorans were found locked inside a sweltering boxcar Sunday during temperatures well over 100 degrees, authorities said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Border Patrol officials found 20 more illegal aliens outside the locked boxcar but aboard the same freight train bound for <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> about 10:30 a.m., said <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>. `` It was well over 100 degrees when we found them,'' <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caller-Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was probably another 20 to 30 degrees hotter inside the car.'' The Salvadorans, including three women and two 14-year-old boys, had been locked inside the car since they boarded the train five hours earlier in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. Some were trying to get air through holes in the boxcar, he said. `` When we opened the car up, the people were pale and real sweaty, and then we transported them to the Border Patrol station in <LOCATION> Kingsville </LOCATION> and gave them water and we fed them,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. If the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> had not intervened, the Salvadorans could have suffered the same fate as 18 aliens found dead last summer locked inside a boxcar near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanca </LOCATION>. The train had traveled about 25 miles north from <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, which is the southernmost city in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and borders <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, when <ORGANIZATION> Harlingen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents noticed aliens aboard, some riding on grain hoppers. The agents then followed the train through isolated ranch land to <LOCATION> Kingsville </LOCATION>, about 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. Officials checked the train car by car at the <LOCATION> Kingsville </LOCATION> freight yard until an agent heard voices inside an insulated boxcar, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. The aliens inside told agents that the door was to have been kept open to allow ventilation, but either the smuggler or a train station employee in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> closed and locked the door, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. Authorities did not know the identity of the smuggler whom the aliens said they paid $ 300 to $ 600, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. The 35 Salvadorans were detained on immigration charges and faced deportation, along with a Honduran man and 19 Mexican nationals, authorities said.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is playing the vice president gambit for everything it's worth, which is n't very much.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus merchandisers, always protective of their high-quality product, are taking action to warn confused consumers they may be spending too much for diluted-juice beverages. `` Deceptive labeling can cost consumers millions of dollars each year,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Behr </PERSON>, economic research director for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION>. Industry leaders are also asking the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to implement _ rather than revoke _ a regulation requiring fruit and vegetable juice products to be clearly labeled to show the percentage of juice. Besides concern that consumers are confusing diluted products for `` real'' orange and grapefruit juice, industry officials are reacting to growing competition from other juices and juice-based drinks. For instance, high prices and a poor consumer image have caused a precipitous decline in sales of 100-percent grapefruit juice over the past decade. Orange juice, too, has lost some of its market share to apple juice and others, plus the soft drinks that contain small amounts of fruit juices. Along with its modest consumer-awareness campaign, the <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is distributing new grapefruit juice television commercials, a departure from recent years when such advertising was limited to newspapers and magazines. In the past, 100 percent-pure grapefruit juice has been primarily advertised as a healthy, wholesome product, says department publicist <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>. `` In addition to that, we are now showing -LRB- in the TV commercials -RRB- that it is more refreshing, invigorating, uplifting,'' she said. The department's citrus marketing director, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, calls the $ 4.3 million, 23-week run of TV commercials beginning in mid-September `` a new approach to grapefruit juice advertising ... to increase top-of-mind awareness and meet the growing competition from other juices or juice-based beverages.'' A recent study done for the <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> showed that 40 percent of the consumers questioned believed that a diluted grapefruit beverage was 100 percent pure juice. The product, advertised as a grapefruit cocktail, contained less than 50 percent grapefruit juice and its label did not show that. If only one person out of 10 mistakenly believes a certain product contains pure juice, consumers could be overspending from $ 50 million to $ 90 million a year, depending on the amount of juice in that beverage, <PERSON> Behr </PERSON> said. `` In some cases, the consumers are actually paying more for a product that is not 100 percent juice, even though that is what they believe they are getting,'' he said. Few of the diluted-juice beverages on grocery shelves have the juice content on their labels, department officials say, despite an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> regulation requiring such information. `` The fruit and vegetable juice labeling rule has been on the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s books for several years, but it has never been implemented,'' said the department's general counsel, <PERSON> Kristen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chadwell </PERSON>. And because of pressure from some industry groups, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has declared its intent to revoke the rule, Ms. <PERSON> Chadwell </PERSON> said. `` We, of course, have since sent them our objections to the revocation and provided them with our research results,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is expected to decide which way to go by the end of the year. The proliferation of juice-based drinks, blends, cocktails, beverages and other variations _ with or without proper labeling information _ has stirred some consumer groups into action. The <ORGANIZATION> Ralph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nader </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> in the Public Interest has called on the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to crack down on manufacturers who do not list the percentage of juice contained in the products. And the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has been looking into false or misleading labels on some of the diluted beverages. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> does require that products sold as orange juice carry labels declaring the exact percentage of juice they contain. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> industry people would like the same rule to apply to grapefruit juice, eliminating at least that problem for the confused consumer.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should abandon farm price supports and production controls to capitalize on a growing demand by poorer nations for food, an economics professor says. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy not only distorts <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production away from its comparative advantage but contributes to the distortion of production decisions around the world,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Antle </PERSON>, an associate professor of farm economics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION>. `` Consequently, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share in commodity trade declines, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fails to exploit its comparative advantage,'' he said. <PERSON> Antle </PERSON> released a study that predicts developed countries, including some in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, will be shipping more food to poor ones in coming years. The four-year study, `` World Agricultural Development and the Future of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture,'' was sponsored by the conservative <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The report does not take into account the current drought in this country and others and its effect on reducing world food reserves. `` Eastern <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are likely to continue to experience high rates of growth in ... food production, and sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> can be expected to continue to face stagnation and even reductions in ... food production and real income,'' <PERSON> Antle </PERSON> said. `` The effect of these trends will be to increase further the ... trade in agricultural commodities, especially cereals, between developed and developing countries,'' his report said. The study predicted increased grain production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> until at least the year 2000. The increase is greater than projected for 12 European nations that compete with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> but less than the projected increase for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other communist-ruled countries in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Antle </PERSON> also predicted surpluses of millions of tons of major food crops in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> in the year 2000, compared with deficits in 1980. But he forecasts continued or larger shortfalls for other parts of the Third World. <PERSON> Antle </PERSON> also said some countries will remain poor even if they use their meager resources efficiently, especially semi-arid tropical regions in south central <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, northern and sub-Sahara <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Most poorer countries will find it hard to increase their imports as <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have done, he said. Those three are small, homogeneous and densely populated with low transport costs, access to shipping lanes, and have been able to make investments in human capital and institutions, he said. The future of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s potential for increased supply and demand depends on its government's decisions, <PERSON> Antle </PERSON> added. `` What does seem fairly certain is that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the middle-income countries of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are particularly well positioned to take advantage of new technologies and new market opportunities,'' he said.

 Broadcasters are being urged to restrict the airing of sexually explicit material while the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> studies new guidelines to shield children from `` indecent'' programs. `` I would tell broadcasters they need to be cautious,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON>, general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> is under orders from a federal appeals court to review the agency's rules governing sexually explicit material on nighttime television and radio. The inquiry is due to begin shortly and take several months before new rules are adopted, said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Killory </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> general counsel. In the meantime, it is unclear at what times in the evening `` indecent'' programs can be aired without fear that unsupervised children will be listening or watching. The appeals court ruling suspended a $ 2,000 fine the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> levied early this year against KZKC-TV, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, for airing the movie `` Private Lessons'' during prime time in May 1987. The action had been the first against a broadcaster since the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> toughened its decency standards in April 1987. The July 29 court decision could affect discussions by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees who will consider an amendment to a budget bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, to prohibit stations from airing indecent material at any time. Congressional sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said despite indications the measure would be struck down in court, chances were good that an election-year <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would pass a ban on broadcast indecency. Courts have ruled that indecent but not obscene material is protected by the First Amendment, though children's access to it may be regulated. The July 29 ruling affirmed the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s definition of indecency, adopted from a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling: `` Language ... that depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs.'' Obscenity is defined similarly except that it also appeals to the prurient interest and lacks serious scientific, literary, artistic or political value. The three-judge panel had trouble with the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of restricting indecent programming to between midnight and 6 a.m., the time the agency determined that children were not likely to be in the audience. The court said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had `` not adequately thought through'' the time restrictions and must try to devise a rule that will `` promote parental _ as distinguished from government _ control.'' The court upheld an FCC warning issued against disc jockey <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> for portions of his show that aired between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> reads that part of the decision to permit continued enforcement of its decency rules during the daytime, <PERSON> Killory </PERSON> said. `` But after that it seems questionable whether the court would let us enforce the indecency rule during an evening broadcast until we have concluded our inquiry and set a specific time in the evening,'' <PERSON> Killory </PERSON> said. `` The court did n't say when daytime ends or evening begins,'' she said. It is possible the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> wo n't conclude the inquiry and approve new rules before the end of the year, she said. In that case, the matter might be handled by a commission shaped by a new administration.

 In beds of damp compost, a web resembling angel hair forms. Tiny stems push out of the mulch, and almost overnight swell into firm, white mushrooms at one of the nation's largest mushroom farms There are no caves or fields, just 8.5 acres of sophisticated mushroom production under the roof at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, in a rural section of <LOCATION> Bureau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. This farm and a sister facility in <LOCATION> Zellwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, both owned by <ORGANIZATION> Lyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, market about 32 million pounds of fresh mushrooms a year, said <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. `` It's a blending of science and art,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` Mushrooms are growing organisms, and you have to handle them very carefully.'' One popular mushroom misconception is that the sublime fungus grows only in the dark and with little attention, he said. Production rooms at <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION> are brightly lit, and the annual payroll for the labor-intensive business is $ 6 million. The key to mushroom production is rich, black soil blended from decomposed straw, manure, protein and peat moss. Each week 35 tractor-trailer trucks arrive at the farm with straw shoveled out of horse stalls at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s racetracks. Steam rises from the long, narrow piles as the pungent material decomposes, producing temperatures of 160 degrees within the compost. `` Our success is here _ good compost makes good mushrooms,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. The straw is pasturized, and protein from soybean, peanut or cottonseed meal is blended into the compost to provide nutrients for the mushrooms. The `` seed'' for the crop is mushroom spawn, which is growing on millet or rye when it is purchased. It is added to the straw and covered with peat moss and limestone. The entire mixture is held in four-by-six-foot trays, each eight inches tall. The trays are stacked to the ceilings in 45 rooms that resemble huge walk-in refrigerators. Temperature and humidity are carefully controlled _ at a cost of about $ 1 million a year, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. The spawn grow a web of fine, white roots from which the mushrooms sprout. Workers gently spray them to maintain moisture. `` It is just light watering, like rain cascading onto the mushrooms, not like putting two fingers over the hose nozzle and flooding it,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. It takes about 36 days for the crop to reach the harvest stage, and picking is done over the course of a month. About half the farm's 425 employees are pickers _ many from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> _ and they gather 380,000 pounds of mushrooms a week. They climb up the trays, pluck the biggest mushrooms from the mulch, trim off the bottoms of the stems, and place many of them directly into clear plastic baskets for supermarket display. The less handling, the less damage to the delicate mushrooms. Larger baskets are used for customers like restaurant operators. Lower quality mushrooms are sent to canning companies. The harvest lands in customers' hands within 24 hours, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a 15-year veteran of the mushroom business. In addition to white and brown mushrooms, <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> also distributes some specialty mushrooms like shiitake. Like any crop, there are threats to the mushrooms: a type of fly will eat the spawn; too much water will cause discoloration; a virus can wipe out production, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. Technicians from the in-house laboratory monitor 140 variables that can affect the harvest. But improved varieties and growing techniques mean <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mushroom growers now produce 650 million pounds a year, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Hospital Workers Reach Tentative Pact, Ratification Vote Monday</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A ratification vote was scheduled Monday for 1,700 hospital workers on strike against eight private hospitals after negotiators reached a tentative agreement on a contract over the weekend. If ratified, the agreement for Local 250 of the <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> could lead to a return of hospital technicians, licensed vocational nurses, orderlies and food service employees back to work. However, the union on strike since July 26 would then have to decide whether to cross the picket lines of 2,000 nurses on strike since Aug. 2 at six of the medical centers. Union trustee <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Splain </PERSON> said there is a provision in the tentative agreement that Local 250 members would not go back to work until the nurses' strike is settled. It was unclear whether the provision would be strictly enforced, particularly if the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> strike is not quickly settled. The dispute between the service worker's union and Affiliated Hospitals had centered on health benefits and sick leave granted employees. `` We do think it's a fair contract,'' Splain said. `` Compromises were made on both sides and it does restore the basic cuts in benefits that we were fighting for. I think the membership will ratify the contract.'' According to a Local 250 statement issued Saturday, the proposed two-year contract grants wage increases of 3 percent for each of the next two years for licensed vocational nurses and so-called second wage-tier employees. Technicians will get a 1.65 percent raise this year, and 3 percent next year. Some other job classifications will receive a one-time bonus of between $ 200 and $ 300. Most importantly, the union said, workers will not have to pay part of the cost of medical insurance unless they choose to see doctors not involved in the Affiliated Hospitals' health maintenance organization. The nurses' union is fighting for pay increases and improved staffing conditions. <ORGANIZATION> CNA </ORGANIZATION> representatives have said bargaining between the hospitals and striking nurses would quickly follow any settlement with the service workers union.
