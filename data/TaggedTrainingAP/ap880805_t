 The Pentagon inquiry into the shooting down of an Iranian civilian jetliner on July 3 is reported to have found that `` human error'' caused by the stress of first-time combat was a factor in the USS Vincennes mistakenly shooting down the plane. Here is a report on the conditions aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the gulf.

 Inexperience, isolation and the need for a constant state of high alert are factors that contribute to high stress aboard the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Just before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile frigate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> sailed into battle April 18, its skipper, Cmdr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, noted that only two among the 225 men aboard had ever been in combat _ himself and his senior chief petty officer. The statistic is not unusual for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, whose crews average about 23 years of age and usually include a few 18-year-olds away from home for the first time. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers say such factors as inexperience, the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>'s oppressive heat, isolation at sea and the demands of staying at high alert around the clock, add up to a `` high stress'' situation that can affect performance. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources say the investigation of the July 3 shooting down of an Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard by the missile cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> found `` human error,'' apparently caused by stress in first-time combat, led radar operators to mistake the A300 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> for a military attack plane. It was not the first time in <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> operations that radar signals have been misinterpreted by radar operators. In an April 18 clash between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian forces, the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' radar indicated it and two other warships were under attack by Iranian Silkworm anti-ship missiles. The ships took evasive maneuvers and launched anti-missile chaff. Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command, later said analysis of computer tapes showed no hostile missiles were fired and the blips were the tracks of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles and what the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> called `` hits on the system.'' On Thursday, a Central Command spokesman, Maj. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Willey </PERSON>, said that study found no `` human error, lack of training or technical malfunction,'' and the ships' officers were justified in assuming they were under attack. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would not comment on a report that one of the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' `` Stinger'' anti-aircraft missile operators was later sent home, suffering apparent psychological problems from his first combat exposure. `` He just kind of choked,'' said a friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s methods for dealing with stress begin with intensive training, which officers say builds confidence, and includes other means ranging from sports, exercise and recreational diversions to personal counseling. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers readily concede that such efforts are not foolproof. `` When a routine that's already full of tension suddenly becomes something a lot bigger, with real danger, maybe shooting, you ca n't predict how people are going to react, especially if they've never done it before,'' said one officer A key element in coping with stress is to assure sailors they are not alone in facing pressure, said another officer. `` We emphasize togetherness, that everybody's part of a team _ the combat information team, the gunnery team, the flight team, whatever. The better your relationships, the better you can function in a situation.'' Few ships promote a `` team'' concept as strenuously as the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. `` Team 49,'' alluding to its hull number, appears on bulletin boards, souvenirs and baseball caps, and is used by Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in addressing his crew. Skippers say their biggest concern is keeping crews in the high state of constant readiness needed in the gulf, where short distances require fast decisions. `` The hardest part of the mission is that you have to stay ready 24 hours a day. There's no time, really, to let your guard down,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON>. Three weeks later, <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON>'s ship, the frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, was nearly sunk when it hit an Iranian mine. Shipboard tensions and boredom are relieved as much as possible by recreational activities. Aboard the amphibious assault ship <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, the crew recently was treated to boxing matches and a rock concert by a touring USO band. `` It's great way to let off steam,'' said a sailor after defeating one of his buddies in the day's featured three-round heavyweight match. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships have spent virtually all of their three-month gulf tours escorting convoys or on patrol, and <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said one reason for deploying a multipurpose warship like the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was to allow others more time in port. Many officers say the entire <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was badly shaken by the shooting down of the Iranian jetliner. However, they say it has not caused any noticeable morale crisis, and the general view is that in the same situation, most commanders would act just as <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> did. `` Every C.O. has to call his best shot, based on the information flow he gets at the time ... and live with that decision the rest of his life. That's what command is all about,'' said the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>'s skipper, Capt <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, who won the Silver Star for valor in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> traditionally relies on chaplains and doctors to counsel those in need, with psychological guidance available in extreme cases. Gulf-based <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers said no special stress counseling or confidence-building programs have been set up in the aftermath of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> affair. `` We do n't have a morale problem,'' said one. Capt. W.D. Center, commander of the missile cruiser <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> and a friend of <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' skipper <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, recalled that when the Airbus was shot down, his ship was just two days out of home port in <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, bound for the gulf. `` We talked about it, then we put it behind us. Everybody understands that we have to get on with the job,'' he said.

<HEAD>Shipboard Bumps In The Night? Maybe It's George, The Friendly
Ghost</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Ghosts are fine, traditional things to have around ancient English castles, but the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says rumors of one stalking the depths of the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forrestal </ORGANIZATION> have spooked a few sailors. Flickering lights. Bumps in the night. Locked doors opening. Voices on disconnected telephones. And a vanishing figure in a khaki uniform. The figure's even got a nickname: <PERSON> George </PERSON>. At least that's what some of the men say aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Forrestal </ORGANIZATION>, in its fourth month of a six-month deployment in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and the North Arabian Sea. They were interviewed by Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, who detailed the story of the ghost in a 12-page news release issued last month. The report about <PERSON> George </PERSON> has n't ruffled any <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> feathers, <ORGANIZATION> Mayport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Balevre </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I thought it was cute. I think most people did.'' `` What Lt. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> had in mind was a fluff piece to show the lighter side of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Balevre </PERSON>. But according to <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION>, some sailors do n't think the ghost story is at all cute. <PERSON> George </PERSON> lurks in two of the ship's below-the-waterline storage areas, one of them a former morgue, spooked sailors claim. `` I've got one guy working for me now who refuses to go down there alone. Our last chief petty officer in charge, who has since transferred, refused to go down there at all,'' says Petty Officer <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Balboa </PERSON>, in charge of the officers' mess. `` I've never seen any ghosts but you can hear weird things down there,'' said <PERSON> Balboa </PERSON>. `` I was taking inventory one night and heard a noise like deck grating being picked up and dropped,'' he recalled. `` I'd turn around and look but did n't see anything. When I turned around to begin my work again, the noise started again.'' One night, <PERSON> Balboa </PERSON> said, he was checking temperatures in food-storage freezers and kept finding open doors he had shut behind him. `` It is impossible for anyone to open the reefer -LRB- refrigerator -RRB- doors from the outside, behind me. To open them from the outside requires a key since the doors lock automatically. `` I had the only key with me. That incident puts me on the verge of believing,'' he said. Some say the ghost is a chief killed during a 1967 flight deck fire that killed 137 sailors in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> off the coast of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> wrote. Others guess he's a pilot whose body was once stored on the ship. Petty Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillard </PERSON> has n't ventured into the haunted areas since he saw <PERSON> George </PERSON> last year while checking out odd footsteps. `` He was wearing a khaki uniform, like an officer or chief would wear,'' he says. He followed the apparition into a compartment but `` there was nobody in there, and I swear that is where he went,'' <PERSON> Hillard </PERSON> said. Mess Specialist 2nd Class <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> saw a khaki-clad ghost go down a ladder to pump room No. 1. Whoever went down into the pump room never came out and the ladder is the only access, he said. <PERSON> Hillard </PERSON> said he once was helping move supplies when a telephone that was reportedly disconnected kept ringing. `` The phone rang and I answered it. This time there was a faint voice calling, ` Help! Help! I'm on the sixth deck!' Rumor had it that a crew member was killed down there. I'm very scared to go down there alone. If I do, I get out of there as fast as I can,'' <PERSON> Hillard </PERSON> said. Others are dubious. `` I think it's the guys' imagination,'' said Senior Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` I'm not superstitious but when I go down there by myself, I find it uneasy. When that happens, your imagination is going to play tricks on you.''

<HEAD>Fire Destroys Part of Reggie Jackson's Car Collection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A warehouse fire destroyed 35 cars owned by <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and the retired baseball slugger and classic auto collector says he's `` hurting.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who lives in nearby <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, was visibly upset Thursday when he went to the warehouse, which was destroyed by fire Wednesday night. He refused to be interviewed at his <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> auto dealership, saying he was `` down'' and `` hurting'' about his loss. Thirty-five cars owned by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were lost, including Corvettes, Porsches, <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION> and other `` high-value collector cars,'' said fire department Capt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Littley </PERSON>. The fire apparently started in a furniture store and spread to the warehouse in the same cinderblock building, officials said. The blaze raged out of control in the 33,000-square-foot warehouse in an industrial area for more than an hour. `` Everything that was in there was gone,'' said fire Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. The cause of the blaze was not immediately known. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> began his car collection in 1971 when he bought a 1940 Chevrolet for $ 300 and a color television. By last October, the collection had grown to 97 vehicles. The rest of his collection was stored elsewhere. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> retired last fall from the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> after a stellar career that also included stints with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Dukakis Campaigns On Environment; Bush Continues Foreign Policy
Attacks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: May be topped.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is laying out his positions on environmental issues during a tour of the West, just as a poll indicated that region represents an untapped resource for Democrats. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invoked the names of <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> to show <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has veered `` far outside the mainstream'' on foreign policy. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to portray the Democratic presidential nominee as occupying the liberal extreme, his own Republican party's right wing was telling the vice president to avoid `` establishment blue bloods'' when choosing a running mate. The warning from the Coalition for a Winning Ticket came as Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> took himself out of consideration. In another campaign matter, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> confirmed Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> would leave his post and become campaign chief before the Aug. 15 start of the Republican convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Sources said the announcement could come today. `` We do n't have to make the false choice, the fool's choice, between economic growth or environmental quality,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, `` We can have both, and in fact we must have both.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> foray followed a trip into <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, a traditionally Democratic state that helped send President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to the White House. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lost the state to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in this year's Democratic primary. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke at the <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fair near where the bodies of three slain civil rights workers were found 24 years ago Thursday. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned at the fair in 1980 for his first term. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> failed to mention the killings when addressing the almost entirely white crowd, and referred only once to civil rights. `` I talked about economic opportunity because that's the most important single thing that concerns people,'' he explained. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking to a Hispanic veterans group in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his support for a nuclear freeze and opposition to a new MX missile, the Midgetman missile and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's proposed Star Wars nuclear defense system. `` His positions ... amount to a rejection of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s role as a world leader and a repudiation of the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> doctrine and the vision of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, referring to bipartisan foreign policy that evolved after World War II and focused on containing communism. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, when asked whether he still supports a nuclear freeze, said, `` Sure, and a comprehensive test ban treaty.'' Later aboard his plane, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he originally supported a freeze `` because we wanted to stop the administration from expanding the arsenal.'' `` Now, it's turned around and we're talking about reduction. I'm for reductions now,'' he said `` I favor the development of certain arms systems. I favor deep cuts in strategic weapons systems.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also stabbed at the Democratic platform, calling it `` the black hole of American politics.'' `` Issues get sucked into it and lost, never to reappear again,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later detoured to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for the wake of a Polish-American leader. It was his third such appearance this week in an ethnic setting as the certain <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee tries to keep <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the multilingual son of immigrants, from winning that segment of the population. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said he took himself out of consideration because Democrats would gain control of the Statehouse in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> if he dropped out. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign said it accepted his decision. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, who heads the conservative coalition urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to choose someone from the right, said Thursday: `` The problem of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is that it is attracted to establishment blue-bloods. What the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ticket needs is a transfusion of red corpuscles from the conservative wing of our party.'' He said Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> would be acceptable. A recent analysis by The Gallup Organization seems to give the Democratic ticket hope in formerly pro-Reagan Western states. The analysis said Western voters are optimistic about their own financial future but dissatisfied with the general course of the nation, and they do n't find in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the anti-establishment leader they found in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. For example, `` traditionally anti-government voters in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> are now calling for more government action on social issues than is the average American voter,'' wrote <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>, head of the Gallup organization. <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON> said the regional analyses he released were developed from 8,500 detailed interviews taken between May and July. The margin of error is just under 2 percentage points. The analysis was done for the <ORGANIZATION> Times-Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

 Here is an example of the information the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will provide in its new `` Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement.'' The figures are actual estimates for a 40-year-old `` John Q. Public'' based on a history of moderate wages for the past two decades. This person, born Dec. 16, 1947, must wait until 66 to qualify for full Social Security retirement benefits. He told Social Security he earned $ 23,938 in 1987, expects to earn $ 23,000 this year and the equivalent of $ 23,000 in future years. Social Security reported back that his earnings record showed nothing earned in 1963 and earlier, and the following in Social Security-taxed earnings and estimated taxes paid since then: 1964: $ 632 $ 22. 1965: $ 497 $ 18. 1966: $ 3,607 $ 151. 1967: $ 4,053 $ 178. 1968: $ 3,833 $ 168. 1969: $ 5,282 $ 253. 1970: $ 6,253 $ 300. 1971: $ 7,142 $ 371. 1972: $ 8,295 $ 431. 1973: $ 9,001 $ 526. 1974: $ 10,239 $ 599 1975: $ 11,163 $ 653 1976: $ 11,516 $ 673 1977: $ 12,663 $ 740 1978: $ 13,769 $ 833 1979: $ 15,158 $ 929 1989: $ 17,407 $ 1,067 1981: $ 18,495 $ 1,229 1982: $ 20,858 $ 1,397 1983: $ 22,485 $ 1,506 1984: $ 25,085 $ 1,680 1985: $ 26,587 $ 1,874 1986: $ 25,647 $ 1,833 1987: Not Yet Posted

<HEAD>Administration Backs Tough Penalties for Medical Waste Dumpers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is backing a congressional move to stiffen prison terms and fines for the kind of medical waste dumping that has left coastlines from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> littered with syringes, dirty bandages and other hospital refuse. Legislation drafted by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, would make medical waste dumping at sea a federal crime punishable by up to $ 250,000 in fines and five years in prison. A hauler dumping hospital debris less than three miles from shore today could face up to 15 years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines under the Clean Water Act, but violators outside the three-mile limit would face a maximum of $ 50,000 in fines and one year in prison under the applicable Marine Sanctuary Act. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> expressed concern that the current laws may not apply to liquid medical waste or cover streams and other non-navigable waters. `` It's clear that our existing state and federal laws dealing with the handling and disposal of medical wastes are inadequate and are not being properly enforced,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. `` It's equally clear that time has come to treat this problem as a criminal offense, not just a regulatory matter.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on crime, said he hoped the measure would act as a deterrent. And he said he would consider adding one provision to allow federal agents to claim the vessels and trucks used by illegal dumpers and a second provision to extend coverage to land dumping. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Muszynski </PERSON>, deputy administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> region, told the subcommittee the agency supports the measure. `` Clearly, it is the feeling of most people that up to a year -LRB- in prison -RRB- is insufficient,'' <PERSON> Muszynski </PERSON> said. Last year, the problem of medical waste washing up on beaches was relegated to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> shores. But in the past month, syringes and other hospital debris have been reported extensively on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> beaches and sporadically in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Late Wednesday, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> reported its first case of medical waste. `` The sad fact is, there seems to be no scarcity of persons willing to dump these wastes anywhere and everywhere in order to avoid the cost of proper disposal or to reap the profits of improper disposal procedures,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. The congressman said it costs hospitals $ 50 to $ 60 a ton for disposal of non-infectious trash, but up to $ 2,000 a ton for `` red bag'' materials that must be handled by private incineration companies. An estimated 25 percent of the 150 million pounds of waste produced annually by hospitals is considered infectious, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. The Hughes bill was introduced Tuesday. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a measure by Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, that would require a `` cradle-to-grave'' manifest system in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> to help officials track medical waste. `` I can no more do my job in the area of environmental protection and enforcement without such a law than I could effectively attack organized crime without wiretaps and the latest surveillance technology,'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` It puts us back to the old gumshoe days.'' <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> and other lawmakers have attacked <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials for failing to take action themselves. <PERSON> Muszynski </PERSON> said the agency does not have the authority to create a pilot program especially for three states. He added that the agency is considering a national manifest system for medical waste.

<HEAD>Study Says Most Companies Do Little To Promote Voting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The promotion of voting is not among the priorities of many of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s companies even though the nation is facing a voter participation `` crisis,'' a private group says. People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that 60 percent of the Fortune 500 companies surveyed conduct little or no organized non-partisan voter registration, education or get-out-the-vote activities. And only 6 percent have voter participation activities that reach beyond their own employees, the group said. Ninety-one of the Fortune 500's top 100 corporations responded to the group's phone and mail surveys, which were conducted in April and May. <PERSON> Melanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Verveer </PERSON>, vice president of the group, said the nation is facing the `` grim possibility'' that for the first time in its history, less than half of the eligible voters will be going to the polls in the presidential election. `` This crisis in participation is the result of a three-decade-long slide in voter participation that threatens to turn our government by all the people into government by less than half the people,'' Ms. <PERSON> Verveer </PERSON> said. She said new institutions must take the lead to stem declining voter participation and she noted that a few businesses have taken exciting initiatives. <PERSON> Sherrod </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, said many major corporations in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> have printed up voter registration forms and mailed them to customers as part of their monthly billing procedures. `` We figure we will put literally millions of registration forms, without government spending ... into prospective voters' hands,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, vice president of the Cleveland-based <ORGANIZATION> Ameritrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said his company began offering voter registration services in <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to its customers and the general public in 1982. `` As a result of our success and the fact that we've had such a good response ... we're going to take this program to the 11 other counties in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> where we have branches,'' <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Verveer </PERSON> said that `` the inescapable conclusion of our study is that for the majority of corporations, voter registration is nowhere to be found on their list of priorities.'' The Washington-based People for the American Way is a non-partisan constitutional liberties organization that conducts public education programs on constitutional issues.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government would crack down harder on the domestic political opposition if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> renews assistance to the Contra rebels. Also Thursday, the foreign minister sent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> a note protesting a river boat ambush that the government and witnesses blamed on the rebels. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is touring <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> this week and was in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> today. In <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> on Thursday, he accused the Soviets of building airstrips in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and called the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> a cancer that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must cut out before it spreads. Aid to the Contras ran out in February, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering new money for the insurgents the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been financing since 1981. The government and the rebels agreed to a cease-fire on March 23, and the government unilaterally extended the truce to the end of August. Speaking at an electricity plant near <LOCATION> Momotombo </LOCATION> about 45 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> warned that the government would `` cut off the oxygen'' of the internal opposition and begin fighting the Contras again if a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid package is approved. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday rejected a $ 27 million <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal for humanitarian aid to the rebels but said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration could still work out a compromise. `` Yankee pressure is not going to make the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> more flexible,'' <PERSON> Orega </PERSON> said. `` Yankee pressure is going to toughen the Sandinistas.'' The government jailed more than 30 opposition figures and cracked down on opposition media after police broke up a large anti-government rally on July 10. It expelled <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

The note was read to The Associated Press by an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>.

 The Palestinian uprising, election year politics and protracted labor disputes are undermining <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s economic recovery program by pushing up inflation and reducing growth Industrial production is down 3.5 percent, the first such drop in eight years, and inflation is expected to exceed 20 percent, up from 16 percent last year and a third higher than initially forecast. `` We had to scale down our expectations'' after more optimistic projections in early 1988, said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowental </PERSON>, assistant director general of economic affairs in the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The gloomier prognosis is accompanied by a `` feeling of insecurity because nobody knows what's going to happen after the -LRB- Nov. 1 national -RRB- election,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Canaan </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> journalist who writes for two West German economic publications. A key reason for the slump is the 8-month-old Arab uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> already has eaten up more than half of this year's growth, initially projected at 3.7 percent. The uprising has cost more than $ 700 million in lost tourism, uncollected taxes and additional military expenses, said <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Neubach </PERSON>, an economic adviser to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. In addition, fewer of the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied lands buy <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> products and about 20 percent of the 110,000 Palestinians working in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> no longer report to their jobs as a result of a Palestinian boycott. `` When you have 1.5 million consumers who used to buy Israeli products, and they stopped doing it, it has a serious effect,'' said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> industrialist, speaking on condition of anonymity. Stability is also threatened by increasing wage demands, backed by numerous strikes by Israeli workers. Excluding Palestinian work stoppages, the Israeli economy lost 1.3 million work days due to strikes in 1987, more than triple the 1986 figure. The labor disputes indicate workers are no longer willing to make the kind of sacrifices they accepted during a 1985 austerity program. Workers then accepted wage cuts of up to 20 percent to help stem soaring inflation and reduce a $ 3 billion budget deficit. The program worked. Inflation dropped to 16.1 percent in 1987, and the budget deficit fell from 13.6 percent of the Gross Domestic Product of 1.2 billion shekels in 1984 to a surplus of 1.7 percent of the 1986 GDP of 1.3 billion shekels -LRB- $ 812 million -RRB-. But in the past two years, real wages have been rising faster than productivity, heating up inflation. And Finance Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON> is under growing pressure to make concessions as the election campaign is heating up. `` Our basic target is to maintain stability,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lowental </PERSON> said. `` But nobody knows what's going to happen with the wages.'' Still unsigned is a tentative agreement for an 11 percent wage increase over two years for the 450,000 civil servants, one-third of the civilian labor force. Also unresolved are private sector negotzed national health system with months of strikes and slowdowns. The government agreed to emergency payments to ease the backlog of 15,000 Israelis waiting for operations, but there has been little progress in wage talks for doctors who earn an average $ 700 a month and are seeking wage hikes of more than 20 percent. If the doctors get large increases, `` it could affect the whole wage structure. If you give higher wages to one group of people, you have to give more to all the others,'' said <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON> also is under pressure to devalue the Israeli shekel which has been fixed at a rate of about 1.6 shekels to the dollar since the days of hyperinflation. Manufacturers complain the strong shekel is making it difficult for Israeli exports to compete and is partly to blame for the drop in industrial production. <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON> has refused to devalue for fear of raising import prices and fueling inflation. Especially hard hit is <ORGANIZATION> Koor </ORGANIZATION>, the industrial conglomerate of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, which lost $ 250 million in 1987, a record in Israeli industry. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which gives <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> $ 1.2 billion a year in economic aid, urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to sell off state-owned companies, lower taxes and cut government spending. The government has taken some steps in that direction. But <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkai </PERSON>, economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said no unpopular steps would be taken during the three-month election campaign. `` The government must close down unprofitable factories and cut spending. But there wo n't be any changes in economic policy before the elections,'' <PERSON> Barkai </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would simultaneously halt their bloodshed and begin peace talks under a compromise solution proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief, but sources say <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is cool to the idea. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> received a report Thursday from a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military team that visited both nations on arrangements for a U.N.-supervised cease-fire. The contents were not disclosed, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said he would make a report to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> today. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has been trying to resolve a standoff between the two nations over the timing of a truce and the start of cease-fire talks in their 8-year-old war. `` I think both parties are interested in a peaceful solution.. The concept of direct talks is accepted by both sides and the matter is when -LRB- they will take place -RRB-. That is something on which I am working,'' he said Thursday. The issue of face-to-face talks between the bitter enemies has complicated the talks on implementing a truce and a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> demands that direct talks be held before a cease-fire and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says they can begin only after a truce. Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has proposed to both sides that he announce a cease-fire date and simultaneously invite both sides to hold direct talks on a comprehensive peace treaty. The sources say the talks and a truce could begin the same day, perhaps in a week if both sides are agreeable. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also is asking that the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> guarantee the truce and other elements of a peace plan. The five _ <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ are considering the issue, the sources said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> did not spell out his proposals for reporters and said he has not yet received a formal response from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Diplomatic sources say <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> is not enthusiastic about the idea, but stopped short of outright rejection of the proposed simultaneous announcement. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s response, although not formal, has been `` constructive.'' `` Unfortunately, from the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> side, I have not received the comments which I have asked for,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told reporters as he left <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. Meanwhile, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in a dispatch from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, who heads <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s negotiating team, met Thursday with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, and visiting Indian Foreign Minister P.V. <PERSON> Narasimha </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON>. The agency said the men discussed the cease-fire resolution and other issues, but gave no other details. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said that next week, probably Wednesday, he would deliver a comprehensive report to the council on the cease-fire declaration, troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange and other elements of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have waged war since 1980, when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded Iranian territory. The death toll is estimated at 1 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in July 1987 adopted a resolution calling for a cease-fire in the war, which has prompted an escalated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval presence in the gulf. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted the proposal, but it was not until last month that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, after a series of battlefield defeats, said it, too, would accept the resolution. Since then, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has launched several attacks on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to bolster its bargaining position. Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> met the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief for more than one hour Thursday. The Iranian envoy made no comments as he left the meeting. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says it needs the direct talks as a guarantee of sincerity from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which it fears will seek only a temporary truce to regroup forces.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> brought his Latin American tour to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> after accusing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of building airstrips in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that threaten the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> arrived in the Brazilian capital Thursday night after a half-day visit to <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, where he portrayed the leftist government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as a `` cancer'' in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is a threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, not for what it might do, but because of the power of the Soviets who are building airstrips there which could pose a problem,'' he told a news conference in <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, the Uruguayan capital. `` There exists a cancer which we have to cut out and we are going to do everything possible to stop its growth,'' the secretary added. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not elaborate on the airstrips. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration repeatedly has ripped the pro-Soviet government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and accused the Soviets of building airstrips there. Hundreds of students and workers from leftist and union organizations marched in downtown <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION> near the Foreign Ministry to protest <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s visit.

<TEXT>
 With youths fully absorbed into the summer job market, economists are looking to the nation's unemployment rate to stabilize after a couple of months of large fluctuations. On the eve of today's release of labor market figures for July, most economists expected the rate either to remain at its 14-year-low 5.3 percent in June or to rise a tenth of a percentage point with an employment increase of 150,000 to 200,000. The jobless rate had bounced like a roller coaster from 5.6 percent in March, down to 5.4 percent in April and back up to 5.6 percent in May before the June decline. Both private analysts and economists for the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said the monthly fluctuations were due primarily to two factors: One factor is the adjustments the government makes with the May and June figures to account for the out-of-school youths flooding the job market. The other factor is the calendar. The survey of 55,800 households upon which the rate is calculated is always taken on the 12th day of the month. Because the 12th occurred in the second week of May but the third week in June, economists said the real rate of joblessness was probably lower than what was reported in May and higher than the June figure. `` I think there will be an uptick to 5.4 percent for July,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` But I would n't consider that as indicative of any new trend or a weakening of the economy.'' Payroll growth soared in June with 345,000 new jobs, compared with average monthly increases of 250,000 from January through May. After slowing down in the spring, factory and construction employment also resumed their upward paths in June. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that new claims for unemployment insurance _ seasonally adjusted _ jumped by 51,000 in the third week of July to 371,000, the highest since last January. `` If the unemployment claims are rising that rapidly, then new job creation may be a little skinny in July,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a private <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> economist who also expected the rate of joblessness to rise to 5.4 percent. However, other analysts attributed the increase in applications for unemployment benefits to temporary layoffs in the auto industry as manufacturers retooled their assembly lines for the 1989 models. Meanwhile, fears that continuous months of unemployment rates in the range of 5.3 percent to 5.7 percent might trigger wage inflation so far appear unfounded. Although employers in tight job market areas along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> are finding they have to pay much more than the minimum wage to attract workers for entry-level jobs, pay increases in general are still below inflation. Hourly wages actually fell 2 cents an hour in June to a seasonally adjusted $ 9.27, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Real wage rates have not yet recovered from a decade of price shocks and slow economic growth,'' said <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayack </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economist. `` They are still nearly 7 percent below their 1978 level.''

 Congressional Democrats are trying again to fashion a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> bill that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would sign in the wake of his rejection of their first attempt to write a defense budget. The Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled today to return to work on a bill appropriating money for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed an earlier <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill because he objected to its reductions in his request for Star Wars anti-missile spending and Democratic-added arms control policy restrictions he opposes. When he vetoed the bill Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> indicated he might be able to accept the appropriations measure, which contains the same cuts in spending for the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known, but none of the arms control limitations. However, those restrictions could be added as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> tries to finish work on the bill befores its adjourns next week for a summer recess that wo n't end until after Labor Day. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also may add to the bill a proposal to send new humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels, but to restrict sharply the possibility of future military help. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is seeking a package that includes immediate military aid. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed the bill which authorized the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget. That measure is the first half of the two-step congressional budget process which also includes an appropriations bill that has money to pay for programs in the earlier authorization measure. Although the vetoed measure authorized $ 299.5 billion worth of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending and the appropriations bill proposes $ 282 billion, the legislation is essentially the same. Dollar totals in authorization bills generally are higher because they cover more projects in future years. When the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> finishes work on the appropriations bill, it will go to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee to be reconciled with separate legislation enacted by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> six weeks ago. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders are considering adding the vetoed bill as an amendment to the appropriation measure, which could force another showdown with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Democrats have decided not to attempt to override the veto, because they could n't muster the two-thirds vote needed in each chamber. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought $ 4.8 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> next year, compared with the program's current budget of $ 3.9 billion. The vetoed bill would have cut his request to $ 4 billion and added other restrictions on what type of anti-missile systems could be developed. The appropriations bill contains $ 3.7 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, and a separate appropriation measure for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> included another $ 300 million for related research. That would bring the total for next year to the $ 4 billion level rejected by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The bill also contains a 4.3 percent pay raise for the nation's 2.1 million uniformed military personnel Conservatives have praised <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, saying it could energize the presidential candidacy of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met Thursday with some of his conservative backers, including former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republican who once chaired the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comittee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the president having vetoed the bill and having drawn the issue clearly is going to make it more politically perilous for the Democratic majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to repeat the bad legislation that appeared in this bill,'' Tower said after the meeting. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Perle </PERSON>, former assistant secretary of defense and now a fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The key issue was the future of SDI. This is not a dispute over details or precise funding levels. The action taken by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ... was intended to kill the program without taking political responsibility.'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, called the veto `` the start of the issue-focused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign and the staving off of creeping lame duckism for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.''

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, ending a week of sharp foreign policy attacks on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, was heading for his oceanside retreat in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to film campaign commercials and continue pondering his choice for a running mate _ with his list one name shorter. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> asked Thursday to be withdrawn from consideration, and the vice president's chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, indicated the governor's wishes would be honored. `` He's going to be very important to us in winning <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. Asked if that was the final word, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said, `` Yes.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aides previously had said <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> was among about a dozen people <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had told were under active consideration. `` As you know, if I were to assume the vice presidency, it would mean turning the entire executive branch of the nation's most populous state over to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said in his letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s lieutenant governor and the next four officials in line for succession are Democrats. The vice president has said he will make up his mind on a running mate before he leaves for the Republican National Convention, where he will be installed formally as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee. However, he has vowed to keep his choice secret until late in the four-day August 15-18 convention. The vice president was traveling later today to his family vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he was to spend the weekend. All five of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s adult children and many of his grandchildren were to be with him for the making of campaign films that will focus on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s family life, aides said. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delayed his departure until later today, possibly for the long-expected announcement that <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> will resign his post to take over as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides Thursday confimed that such an announcement was imminent. There has been wide speculation that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would make the announcement today at the close of financial markets. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to name <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banker <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> _ a close friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s _ to fill out the rest of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s term. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> 2 that he also will be working on his convention acceptance speech in the days ahead. `` We're going to go over the left field fence'' with the speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has been focusing on defense and foreign policy issues all week, told a Hispanic veterans group in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on Thursday that foreign policy stands taken by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, would amount to `` unilateral disarmament.'' `` All my experience tells me that the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' views, if implemented, would make the world not a safer place, but more dangerous,'' he told the G.I Forum. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had `` veered far outside the mainstream'' bipartisan consensus formed after World War II to confront communist threats to `` free people'' worldwide. `` His positions ... amount to a rejection of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s role as a world leader and a repudiation of the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> doctrine and the vision of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He cited <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support for a nuclear freeze and opposition to advanced weapons systems favored by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Democratic platform is `` no help'' in trying to determine where the Democratic presidential nominee stood on foreign-policy issues. `` The Democratic platform is the black hole of American politics,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Issues get sucked into it and lost, never to reappear again.'' After leaving <PERSON> Corpus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made an unscheduled visit to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to attend a wake for <PERSON> Aloysius </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazewski </PERSON>, who had been president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Majewski </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described as a friend of long standing and `` a great Polish-American leader,'' died Wednesday of a heart attack.

<HEAD>Young Pilot Faces West German Charges For Buzzing Kremlin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON>, facing possible criminal charges in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for flying an airplane to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Red Square, is getting less than a hero's welcome in his homeland after he was freed from a Soviet prison. The 20-year-old Rust was in seclusion on Thursday, the day after the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> cut short his four-year prison term he received for buzzing the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> spires on May 28, 1987. He said in a brief television interview from <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> that he was glad to be home after more than 14 months in prison. But he also faces two investigations, one of them by licensing officials in `` We are now investigating whether he is trustworthy enough to be flying. That's the question,'' spokesman <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Heidenreich </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone from <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>. `` He still has the right to be heard, so no final decision has been made.'' A suspension of the license also is possible, <PERSON> Heidenreich </PERSON> said, but declined to predict the outcome of the investigation. In the northern town of <LOCATION> Itzehoe </LOCATION>, prosecutor <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Schamerowski </PERSON> said he was looking into possible criminal charges of fraud and endangering air traffic. The possiblility of a fraud charge stems from Rust's misstating his destination when he checked out his flying club's single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> and took off on a one-day jaunt to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We'll have to wait for the questioning of Rust to see how the investigation proceeds,'' <PERSON> Schamerowski </PERSON> told reporters Thursday. `` Only after the end of the investigation will it be clear whether there will be any sanctions against him in the federal republic -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Schamerowski </PERSON>'s jurisdiction includes <ORGANIZATION> Wedel </ORGANIZATION>, the Rust family's hometown, six miles west of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> Rust got his pilot's license from <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> state. The aircraft is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Hamburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aero-Club </ORGANIZATION>, where Rust is still a member. In addition to facing possible federal charges, Rust may have to pay Aero-Club an unspecified amount for maintenance costs on the aircraft. Spokesman <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Gass </PERSON> also predicted Rust will resign from the <LOCATION> Aero-Club </LOCATION>, because of members' `` negative feelings'' about the famous pilot. Rust repeated the reasons for his flight in a brief interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Norddeutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio and television network of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>. `` The motives were, as I've always said, to improve relations between our countries with this flight, with my existence, with the landing _ and to further the cause of peace in general,'' Rust said. `` That was the goal.'' But a poll by the <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper indicates that most West Germans do not approve of his daredevil act. The newspaper said that in its poll of 1,009 people, only 4 percent said they consider Rust a `` hero,'' 60 percent saw his flight as `` criminal mischief,'' 7 percent as a `` serious crime,'' and the remainder as a `` dumb act attributable to youth.'' Fifty-two percent of those polled thought Rust should permanently lose his pilot's license, <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said in a telex to other news organizations.

<TEXT>
 Both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are expected to act next week on a $ 3.9 billion drought aid compromise calling for a three-month dairy price-support increase but limiting feed assistance for livestock producers. `` The bill we have completed seeks to ensure the future for our farmers and ranchers,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said Thursday night after a conference committee agreed to the measure <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said floor action would come Thursday at the latest but that he would try for accelerated handling and final approval Monday or Tuesday. Fast action also was expected in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Farm lawmakers in both houses were forecasting overwhelming approval for the election-year measure. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was expected to sign the bill. Its $ 3.9 billion price tag represents a steep cut from levels at which administration budget officials said lawmakers would start to flirt with nasty fiscal repercussions. At the core of the measure is a feature that would pay farmers with 65 percent of lost earnings beyond 35 percent of the expected harvest. Larger payments would be available for farmers very severely hurt by the fierce heat and shortage of rainfall plaguing the nation's heartland. The bill would furnish such producers with 90 percent of losses over 75 percent of their expected harvest. It represented a compromise between the 95 percent level the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved and the 85 percent passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Conferees fenced verbally without agreeing on much in sessions Thursday morning and early afternoon. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> and de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> finally went behind closed doors with top <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the conference committee. They emerged Thursday night with a compromise that was swiftly agreed to by other members of the conference committee. The compromise jettisoned a Senate-passed provision that would provide government feed assistance to farmers who would not ordinarily be producing their own feed even if not for the drought. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said Wednesday he would be reluctant to recommend the feature to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> because the price tag was $ 2 billion. Instead, the conferees opted for a House-passed provision that would provide assistance to livestock producers who also produce their own feed. The price tag would be $ 800 million by administration estimate. Livestock feed has become a key to the drought issue. Heat and a lack of rain have scorched a substantial quantity of hay and feed grains in the midcontinent, causing feed prices to shoot up. Retained by the compromise was the one major dispute that the conferees had resolved earlier: a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> provision that would raise the dairy price-support level in April through June next year by 50 cents to $ 11.10 for each 100 pounds of milk. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> voted `` aye'' to the dairy plan while all of the other <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees remained silent. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chairman's home state is a major source of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION>'s milk supply. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> recedes to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by one weak aye,'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> chortled. Major modifications were made by conferees in a Senate-approved provision that would constitute a major benefit for American manufacturers of ethanol _ ethyl alcohol made from farm products and mixed with gasoline to form the fuel gasohol. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s plan would have allowed ethanol makers to buy 2 million bushels each of surplus corn, or other crops, each month at 110 percent of the goverment-owned <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition price _ well below current, drought-inflated prices The total available would have been limited to 16 million bushels a month. It was described by proponents as a move to boost a number of small ethanol manufacturers, but it also could have turned into a sizable subsidy for the <ORGANIZATION> Archer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daniels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, a major corporation with a politically active management. As reshaped by the conference committee, the program's fate would be left up to the secretary of agriculture. `` I do n't think it will be put into effect,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., the ranking <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Ethanol producers that use more than 30 million bushels of corn a year would be excluded from the program. The conference committee adopted <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> provisions that would make disaster payments available to farmers hit by disasters other than the drought, including some that happened in 1987. The payments would be for `` drought, hail, excessive moisture or related condition.'' De la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said the related condition `` includes hurricanes, because they come with moisture.'' The hail payments were designed to compensate cotton growers in the district of Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Combest </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, where a severe storm hammered the crop last year. Administration officials had opposed going beyond payments to drought victims. The two houses compromised on a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> requirement that farmers would have to buy federal crop insurance in 1989 and 1990 to receive disaster payments. Under the legislation, they would have to buy one year of the insurance if their disaster loss exceeded 65 percent of normal yield.

 The Soviets hope to develop an atomic-powered rocket engine to provide the propulsion for a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> early in the 21th century, a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> scientist said Thursday. <PERSON> Vasiliy </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said experts in his nation believe that `` a new type of rocket'' will have to be developed to make a planned 1 -LCB- - year voyage to and from <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> said Soviet engineers are working on an `` atomic-electric'' rocket engine that would be used to accelerate a Mars explorer craft once it has been boosted into Earth orbit. The Soviet scientist, speaking at a news conference at the 20th general assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, declined to give any details on the atomic-electric rocket, but he said none of the current chemical rockets used by the Soviets is large enough for a Mars mission. Included in the Soviet fleet of launch rockets is the <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest, but <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> said even it is not powerful enough. American space scientists long have recognized the need to develop propulsion systems that did not depend upon the chemical reaction of fuel and oxidizer. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has conducted some research on electric and ion drive rockets, but the project has never been received money for development. <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> said the Soviets are giving the exploration of Mars a high priority. Two Soviets probes to Phobos, a moon of <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, were launched last month. In 1994, he said, the Soviets will send an unmanned craft to Mars carrying a robot rover that would explore hundreds of miles on the planet's surface. The rover also would take drill samples and measurements of the atmosphere. The next stage of the program, <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> said, is testing in space new technical elements needed for a manned mission, including the atomic-electric rocket and a rocket to return to orbit from the Mars surface. The Soviets also plan a robot craft that would land on Mars, collect soil samples and then return them to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. A manned Martian mission could be mounted by the year 2005 or 2010, <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> said. Preliminary plans call for a six-member crew to make the voyage in a two-stage craft that would be assembled in Earth orbit, he said. Although the Soviets have gathered a great amount of information about the de-conditioning effects on the human body of longterm space flight, <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> said the Mars mission may use artificial gravity to keep the crew members healthy. Both American and Soviet studies have shown that long exposure to the weightlessness of space causes the heart to weaken and the body to lose bone mass. <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> said the Soviets hope that American scientists and astronauts will take part in the Mars mission, but even without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation, the Soviets are determined to explore the red planet. Mars has been only partially explored by the American Viking spacecraft, he said, adding: `` It is our impression that it is time to return to Mars.'' Soviet scientists want to search for traces of liquid water on the Martian surface and still hold out hope that there may be life, even though <PERSON> Viking </PERSON> found no traces, <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't give guarantees that life in some form does n't exist there now, despite the negative findings of Viking,'' he said.

He said prison had made him sink into depression, but his campaign supporters had `` meant more to me than you can imagine.'' `` Not since our forefathers signed the Declaration of Independence has someone that has been treated as I have, falsely accused, imprisoned and written off not just as a politician or a public servant but as a human being, has come back and said, ` Look, I have something to offer' and had so many people embrace the idea,'' <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> said. `` I have been to the depths of depression when most people would have said I give up,'' he said. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> refused to say whether he would run for any other political office, and would not discuss any reason for his loss. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> was one of four Democrats vying for the chance to succeed retiring Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> in the 8th District. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a 19-year House veteran, has backed state Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> to run against the winner of the three-way <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. With 295 of 316 precincts reporting, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> had 43,127 votes, or 67 percent, of Democratic votes. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> had 6,809 or 11 percent. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Conger </PERSON> had 9,796 votes, or 15 percent; lawyer <PERSON> Ivy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarbrough </PERSON> had 5,051, or 8 percent. In the Republican race, lawyer <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> came from behind to defeat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, national chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, win the right to meet <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> in November. With 295 of 316 precincts reporting, <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> polled 6,280 votes, or 57 percent to 3,839, or 35 percent, for <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> businessman, trailed with 810 votes or 7 percent. For the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, incumbent Democrat <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, seeking his third six-year term, had no primary opposition. In the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary, lawyer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Kingsport </LOCATION> law firm includes former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> as a partner, beat party activist <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Algood </PERSON> and and lawyer <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> for the chance to oppose <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> in November. With 2,223 of the state's 2,391 precincts reporting, <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> had 73 percent or 102,485 votes to 22 percent or 30,718 for Mrs. <PERSON> Algood </PERSON>. `` I want to congratulate Mr. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> on a very energetic and successful campaign and we are going to get our campaign in high gear,'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said Thursday night. In the 2nd District, where Republican Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> died June 21, his son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> easily won the nomination for his late father's seat. With all 190 precincts in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> district reporting, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> had 32,813 votes, or 87 percent. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Proffitt </PERSON> had 4,913 votes, or 13 percent. <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a former state revenue commissioner, led in Democratic voting in the 2nd District. With all 190 precincts, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had 7,713 votes, or 41 percent, to 5,249 or 28 percent for <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a chemical engineering professor. Political unknown <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, who conducted no campaign, had 5,639 votes or 30 percent. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Reps. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> won renomination as expected in <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primaries in the 3rd and 9th districts, respectively. With all 220 precincts reporting, Ms. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> had 89 percent, or 81,017 votes against newcomers <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, with 2,168 votes or 6 percent, and <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON>, with 1,822 votes or 5 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, with 156 of 187 precincts reporting, had 29,410 votes, or 80 percent against businessman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, who lost to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> for the eighth straight time. <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> had 7,310 votes or 20 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has been indicted in federal court on bank fraud charges, but no trial date has been set. He said it has not affected his campaign. In the 7th District primary contest, Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloodworth </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> for the right to challenge Republican <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundquist </PERSON> in November.

 Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was convicted of racketeering in a far-reaching bribery and extortion scheme used to transform a tiny <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> machine shop into the multimillion-dollar defense contractor known as <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. After <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s conviction by a federal jury Thursday, the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> set Sept. 7 as the date for considering a recommendation from its Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that it expel the 10-term Democrat. `` The overwhelming likelihood is that the recommendation will be followed,'' Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to expel <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, who was convicted last year on an unrelated corruption charge. `` Maybe it's time they acted,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> told a news conference. `` This congressman has been convicted of numerous felonies.'' Earlier this year, the Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> recommended <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> be expelled for the earlier conviction. But the committee held off sending the resolution to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor until after the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> trial so <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> could defend himself in person. After five days of deliberations, the jury found <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and four co-defendants guilty of turning now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> into an enterprise that paid millions in bribes to public officials. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, a city policeman from 1942 to 1965 and at one time the most decorated police officer in the country, was also convicted of extortion and bribe-taking. `` We're obviously disappointed, and we're going to appeal,'' <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, 70, said outside the courtroom. Earlier, he had complained of chest pains and was treated in the courthouse nurses' office. It was the second legal blow of the week for <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, whose 1987 conviction was upheld Monday by a federal appeals court. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> scheduled sentencing for Nov. 18. All six of the convicted defendants remained free on bail. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s eldest son, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was acquitted of racketeering charges but convicted of bribe taking, mail fraud and tax charges. Also convicted of racketeering and other charges were former <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 58; <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION>; former <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> regional head <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Neglia </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Armonk </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s former law partner, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>, 59, of <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>. A seventh defendant, former city police officer <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Betso </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, was acquitted on all counts. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was convicted of all but one of the 16 counts against him, including conspiracy, extortion, tax evasion and receiving bribes. He faces up to 20 years in prison on the racketeering counts, the most serious charges. He has been sentenced to 30 months in prison for the 1987 conviction in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> for obstructing justice and taking an illegal gratuity. Prosecutors also sought forfeiture of millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains by the five convicted of racketeering. In addition, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON> face fines of more than $ 7 million each. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was convicted of extorting $ 50,000 in cash and stock once worth more than $ 3 million from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for his political clout. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> also was convicted of filing false financial disclosure statements and tax returns to cover up his illegal profits. More than 130 witnesses were called in the trial, which began March 11. Four former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives who pleaded guilty to state and federal corruption charges and testified for the government in exchange for leniency. At the heart of the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> case was how <ORGANIZATION> Welbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a tiny machine shop <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> started in 1965, became a multimillion-dollar defense contractor. <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> was once hailed as a `` hero for the'80s'' by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for hiring ex-convicts and former drug addicts in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most economically depressed areas. Prosecutors, however, charged that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was built on greed, and that <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> and others at <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> bribed <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neglia </PERSON> for help with city and federal agencies. Prosecutors charged that <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>, the younger <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betso </PERSON> helped those three receive or cover up the payoffs. However, the defense contended that the corrupt <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives who testified had the ear of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> insiders like Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and did not need to bribe <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>. They noted that former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> was convicted in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of illegal lobbying for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>; that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was under investigation by a special prosecutor for his <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> dealings; and that a close <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend, lawyer <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, was indicted for allegedly taking <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> payoffs to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other officials. Near the end of the trial, the special prosecutor announced there was insufficient evidence to charge <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> with wrongdoing, but questioned the attorney general's ethics on several issues. Prosecutors in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> trial claimed the so-called `` Meese defense'' was a smoke screen to divert attention away from the seven defendants.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets Prepare for Monitoring Experiment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PAHUTE MESA, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists and construction workers swarmed over this scenic, sunbaked plateau Thursday, making final preparations for an historic U.S.-Soviet nuclear weapons verification experiment later this month. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the Aug. 17th test and another planned in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> next month were a `` breakthrough in negotiations between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on nuclear testing. `` It is unprecedented to be able to exchange this type of data,' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator at talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on nuclear testing. Reporters were taken Thursday to the test site 130 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> for a day-long briefing and an impromptu news conference held on a platform four-tenths of a mile above the nuclear device. The blast will have an explosive punch of up to 150 kilotons, nearly 12 times the force of the atomic bomb that destroyed the Japanese city of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> 43 years ago Saturday. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Behne </PERSON>, test director from <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, told the gathering that no one would be allowed within 15 miles of the site when the device is detonated. The experiment is designed to test the ability of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to monitor the size of each other's nuclear tests Such monitoring is critical to comply with treaties limiting the size of nuclear tests under a policy of `` trust but verify.'' Treaties limiting tests to no more than 150 kilotons were passed in 1974 and 1976 but never ratified. Some three dozen Soviet scientists will be on the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> test site for this month's blast, code-named <PERSON> Kearsarge </PERSON>. American scientists will monitor the September Soviet test at <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION>. The device that will be detonated later this month was delivered July 20 and placed 180 feet above the bottom of a 2,200-foot vertical shaft. The Soviet scientists, who have been on the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> site since spring, were not allowed to see the device itself, according to <PERSON> Behne </PERSON>. But the Soviets were allowed to examine the 8-foot canister holding the device once the container, painted red white and blue, was sealed. The joint verification experiment will focus on cables half an inch in diameter, running to the site of detonation from instrument trailers hundreds of yards away and down to the device itself. Additional cables are placed in a second hole 30 feet away from and parallel to the weapon shaft. The tests come two years after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed using a system called Corrtex, which is designed to measure the size of a nuclear blast by the shock waves emitted from the nuclear device. The Soviets will be using a similar system of their own called <PERSON> Miz </PERSON> and a second system which takes similar measurements. The joint tests are to determine whether the two monitoring systems are compatible and whether explosions can be monitored by having the cables only in the second hole. The sticking point for both countries has been the idea of allowing one country to place monitoring cables in the same hole as the device itself. The breakthrough on the test verification issue came late last year in talks at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> when both sides agreed to exchange scientists and monitor a test at each site. Officials say that if the monitoring systems work, each country could have scientists at the other's nuclear test site for all future tests.

<HEAD>U.S. To Help Arrange Loan for Debt-Troubled Argentina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it is working with debt-troubled <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to arrange a short-term loan of up to $ 500 million from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other creditor nations. The so-called `` bridge'' loan would allow <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to meet interest payments on its $ 56 billion foreign debt while it negotiates with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. But, according to a department statement, funds from the short-term loan, will not become available until <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> `` meets the requirements ... under the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s ... lending program.'' <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, which is more than 90 days past due on more than $ 300 million in payments, has said it can not afford to make its overdue interest payments. Recently, the nation has taken measures to cut its budget deficit and check its inflation, running about 20 percent a month. This week, it declared a three-day bank holiday and devalued its currency. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' willingness to participate in this effort reflects support for <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s economic reform efforts and the determination of the government of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to address its international financial relations in a constructive manner,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> statement said. It said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is working with other creditor governments through the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Settlements </ORGANIZATION>, a clearinghouse in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for central banks, to formulate the bridge loan. `` These efforts will be fully supported as well by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and we expect that they will be supported as well by the international financial community,'' it said. In its own statement, The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> said it was ready to start negotiations with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> for a $ 1.2 billion loan. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month offered a similar bridge loan to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which is seeking to restore its standing in the international financial community after declaring a moratorium on its debt payments last year.

 The House on Thursday gave lopsided bipartisan approval to a $ 7.1 billion election-year package of minor tax changes that would benefit farmers, mutual-fund owners, free-lance writers and rural mail carriers. The targeted tax cuts would be financed by higher taxes on defense contractors, certain other corporations, pipe smokers and purchasers of single-premium life insurance policies. The 380-25 vote for the bill was easily the widest margin by which any tax legislation has been approved over the last decade. Voting for the measure were 230 Democrats and 150 Republicans; 6 Democrats and 19 Republicans voted no. The bill now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has approved a stripped-down version. The chief purpose of the 960-page <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill is to correct errors and clear up ambiguities in the landmark tax overhaul enaced in 1986. Since this is almost certainly the only tax bill with a chance of becoming law this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> used it to carry dozens of substantive tax changes. Despite its size, the bill is one of the smallest pieces of tax legislation in recent years. The <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> estimates it would cut taxes by about $ 7.1 billion through 1991 and raise taxes by about $ 47 million less than that amount. Nevertheless, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., committee chairman, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, `` This bill is in keeping with the spirit of tax reform. He and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the committee, emphasized that unlike most tax bills of recent years, the legislation includes no tax breaks that are targeted for the benefit of only one or two individuals or corporations. Among the dozens of provisions are those to:

<HEAD>`Checkmates,' A New Comedy, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>

 `` Checkmates'' is a crudely constructed, cartoonish comedy by <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Milner </PERSON> about the generation gap, but this time the gap is n't between father and son or mother and daughter. It's a chasm between two married couples. These middle-class couples also happen to be black, but do n't expect any revelations about race relations and what being black in a white society can do to a marriage `` Checkmates,'' which opened Thursday at the 46th Street Theater, is played mainly for laughs _ cheap laughs, easy laughs, laughs that do little to illuminate character or advance the plot. Plot is something that `` Checkmates'' rarely encounters. The play is mostly a series of sitcom sketches populated by one couple or the other as they fight, make love or just try to get through the day. Naturally, these people are a study in contrast. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mattie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> have been married for 45 years. They have four children, six grandchildren and a comfortable home in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> where they are getting through <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s retirement by talking about the couple upstairs. Their tenants are <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, young, upwardly mobile and and preoccupied with `` self'' rather than `` we.'' He's a salesman. She works as a buyer for a department store. Career conflicts _ she's on the way up, he could be on the way down _ threaten their marriage. The audience watches as one marriage reaffirms itself and the other falls apart. But it's hard to care for these characters whether they are up or down. <PERSON> Milner </PERSON> wrote the book for `` Do n't Get God Started,'' a gospel show that ran on Broadway for several months last season. It was a musical morality tale with dramatized lessons about life and love interspersed with some rousing gospel songs. Those same messages about sharing, caring and giving show up in `` Checkmates,'' but this time there are no soaring melodies to lift the spirits between the sagging and soggy vingettes. To pad out the evening, the playwright flashes back to tell the older couple's story. You can tell when that happens because the lighting _ some lurid effects by designer <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> _ changes color. In these moments, the audience learns of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s decision to leave his family and fight during World War II as well as his affair with a French woman. At least the production has been superbly cast, with <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> starring as the older duo and <PERSON> Denzel </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appearing as the younger couple. Miss <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> is a radiant actress and <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> a forceful stage presence, so they mine the comedy for every giggle they can. It's depressing to watch them work so hard with such meager results <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has an ingratiating stage manner. He survives because of his winning personality and not because of anything the author gives him to say or do. Miss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, as the young wife, has a harder job. She must always be on the offensive, hammering away at her husband or whining about her job, and the complaints grow tiresome. The wide stage at the 46th Street Theater has been sliced in half by two separate apartments, both realistically designed by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Burbridge </PERSON>. The action alternates between the two homes with the predictability of a boring tennis match. Director <PERSON> Woodie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, Jr., does n't do anything to lessen the ping-pong effect. But it's hard to see what King could have done to liven up the evening. Because of <PERSON> Milner </PERSON>'s simple-minded and obvious script, `` Checkmates'' is checkmated even before the curtain goes up.

 Retired baseball star and classic car collectdor <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lost 35 automobiles when fire destroyed a warehouse where the cars were stored and caused $ 4 million in damage, officials said Thursday. The fire apparently started in a furniture store Wednesday night and spread to the warehouse in the same cinderblock building. The fire department said 35 cars owned by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were destroyed, including Corvettes, Porsches, Barracudas, <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION> and other `` high-value collector cars,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Littley </PERSON>, who also said five motorcycles were destroyed. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who lives in nearby <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, was visibly upset when he went to the warehouse Thursday. He declined to be interviewed at his <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> automobile dealership, saying he was `` down'' and `` hurting'' about the loss. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> began his car collection in 1971 when he bought a 1940 Chevrolet for $ 300 and a color television. By last October, the collection had grown to 97 vehicles. The rest of his collection was stored elsewhere. The fire, visible from the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, raged out of control in the 33,000-square-foot warehouse in an industrial area for more than an hour. `` Everything that was in there was gone,'' said fire Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. The cause of the blaze was not immediately known. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> retired last fall from the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> after a career that included stints with the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>.

 A man who said he grew up with `` prejudices against anything that is n't white'' pleaded guilty Thursday to a charge that he had threatened to kill black Democratic presidential aspirant <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 30, pleaded innocent in May to four charges contained in a federal indictment against him. He had been scheduled to stand trial Aug. 8. Under a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty Thursday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Filippine </PERSON> to charges of threatening <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s life and possessing an unregistered automatic rifle Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said he would move to drop the other two charges _ threatening and intimidating a government informant _ at sentencing, scheduled for Oct. 14. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> faces up to 13 years in prison and $ 500,000 in fines. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, 27, were arrested May 13 at their apartment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, about 50 miles west of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. At the time, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination. The Williams were arrested after an informant told authorities that they were involved in a conspiracy with white supremacists to kill <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The informant agreed to meet again with <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and wear a hidden microphone. The indictment did not mention conspiracy and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was unable to find any evidence that the Williamses belong to a white supremacist organization. On Thursday, <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> read part of the transcript of their recorded conversation, in which <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was `` trying to make a fool out of us white people'' by running for president. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said it was time <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` goes into the refrigerator. And that's what I'm about.'' After he was arrested, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told reporters that he grew up with `` prejudices against anything that is n't white.'' `` There seems to be a white <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` That's how I've been raised.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was indicted on charges of possessing an unregistered automatic rifle, and threatening and intimidating the government informant. She has pleaded innocent. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said her trial is set for Sept. 6.

 A lobbyist for gun owners was justified in fatally shooting an intruder who broke into his gun store two weeks ago, a grand jury decided Thursday. <PERSON> Donn </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBiasio </PERSON>, 59, of <ORGANIZATION> Smithfield </ORGANIZATION>, used reasonable force in defending himself, even though he shot the intruder more than once, Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said at a Thursday news conference. <PERSON> DiBiasio </PERSON>'s case was turned over to the grand jury July 21, the day after he fatally shot <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, 23, three times at his Providence store, D & amp; <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antenna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Electronics and D-B Guns. He was arrested shortly after the incident and charged with murder, then arraigned and released on $ 1,000 personal recognizance the following day. `` It means the world has been lifted off my shoulders,'' said <PERSON> DiBiasio </PERSON> after Thursday's announcement. `` I think this certainly gives a message to the citizens of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> ... that the police can not protect all citizens at all times.'' <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> denied earlier news reports that <PERSON> DiBiasio </PERSON> had appeared to lie in wait for the intruder, since he was in the store around 10:30 p.m. when the break occurred. <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said <PERSON> DiBiasio </PERSON> just happened to be in the store. <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said he was satisfied with the grand jury's findings and does not think it will encourage vigilante acts. The grand jury heard the testimony of 13 people and police reports and took two weeks to come up with the decision, <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DiBiasio </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for 20 years, said he intends to keep his store open.

 Former Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, recovering from a near drowning, talked politics with reporters and her nurses Thursday, and said she's feeling much better. `` I really feel great. All I know is right now, I could not die because this is the Democrats' year and I have got to be around to celebrate it,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, 52, who remained in fair condition at <LOCATION> Brackenridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> gave the seconding speech for Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as the Democrats' vice presidential candidate at the party's recent Democratic National Convention Sitting in a chair in her hospital room, Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> remarked on the good wishes she has received from across the nation. `` I have received cards, telegrams, letters, flowers from all over this country,'' she said. `` If I did have the desire to return to active politics, I think I could make a good run at national office. I am very grateful and I feel very fortunate to have so many people feel do deeply and care so much for me.'' The former three-term congresswoman and first black state senator in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> history said she has no plans to leave her current teaching job at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lyndon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. `` My plans were and are to continue to teach ... and to continue to educate young minds to take over this country,'' she said.

She lost consciousness while in her backyard swimming pool and was found face-down in the pool by her roommate. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who uses a wheelchair because she suffers from what doctors say is a disease similar to multiple sclerosis, swims for exercise.

She also said she was grateful for the efforts of the emergency medical service technicians and hospital helicopter crew who rescued her. `` It's a compilation of people who did superb work to see to it that I can sit here today and talk to you.

<HEAD>Redford's Trip To Cuba Reportedly Under Investigation</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is reportedly investigating whether actor-director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> violated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law during a recent three-day trip to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. An attorney for <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, however, says the inquiry is not an investigation. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, 50, returned from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> last May from what he described as a script-writing workshop for women in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, whose latest film, `` The Milagro Beanfield War,'' is showing in <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and American theaters, said he also met with Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Newcomb </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> enforcement office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, wrote <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> in May and asked him to explain whether he paid his own expenses or whether they were paid by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He also wanted to know how and where he entered the country. <PERSON> Newcomb </PERSON> declined to comment Thursday when he was contacted at home by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said any comment would have to come from department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade ban with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> bars all unlicensed economic transactions in which <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has an interest. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Chieffo </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, confirmed Thursday that the actor received a letter from the treasury department asking about his trip to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` I would n't really call it an investigation.

Another lawyer representing <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON>, also declined to give details. `` We have written them -LRB- <PERSON> Newcomb </PERSON>'s office -RRB- a letter.

 Sales slowed at the nation's largest general retailers in July thanks to the relentless heat wave that kept shoppers at home, the stores have reported. The July results announced Thursday ended a modest recovery the stores enjoyed in June _ which followed a slump in April and May caused by cold and rain. July generally is not an important month for retailers except for clearance sales, analysts say.

<HEAD>Productivity Deteriorates In Second Quarter</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be led with Labor Department report on July
unemployment, scheduled for 8:30 am EDT release.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Business productivity deteriorated at a rate not seen in seven years while labor costs soared during the second quarter, the government has said in a report that sparked sparking concern over the future of the economy's competitive vigor. In another report on Thursday, the nation's largest retailers said sales for July were lackluster as unusually hot weather kept many consumers out of stores. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said the efficiency of non-farm businesses in producing goods and services declined 1.7 percent in the quarter ended June 30, its first decline in two years and the biggest drop since 1981. Productivity had risen at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the second quarter and had been improving at a rate of 1 percent to 2 percent annually in the previous three years. Reflecting the strong economic expansion, output of goods and services by those businesses responsible for three-fourths of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic activity rose 4.7 percent in the second quarter. But to achieve that growth, companies increased their work hours by 6.5 percent, hiring hundreds of thousands of new employees to send the unemployment rate to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent. Meanwhile, labor costs soared 5.9 percent in the first quarter as hourly wages and benefits rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent. After taking into account a 4.4 percent annual rate of inflation in the last 18 months, workers' purchasing power actually declined 0.6 percent from April through June, the department said. Among retailers, the nation's biggest store chains were at the mercy of weather extremes as a relentless heat wave kept shoppers home last month, preventing stores from clearing out their summer merchandise. The July results ended a modest recovery the stores enjoyed in June, which had followed a slump in April and May caused by cold and rain. Overall, consumers have cut back on their retail outlays over the past year and a half because of high installment debt levels and uncertainty about the economy. As a result, retailers' sales have been a soft spot in an otherwise strong economy. Consumer spending, which also includes expenditures for food, medical care, autos, utilities, transportation and other necessities, is watched closely because it accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Continue Weak Trend In July</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hot weather sent the nation's largest general retailers back into a slump during July, but the stores and Wall Street analysts are looking toward August with some optimism. Last month's relentless heat largely kept shoppers out of stores, hampered retailers' attempts to clear out summer merchandise and made sales reports issued by the stores Thursday disappointing. The higher temperatures ended a modest rally the retailers enjoyed in June. In addition to weather, the stores' reports reflected the overall softness that has plagued the retail industry for about a year and a half, said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Consumers have cut back on their retail spending because of high installment debt levels and uncertainty about the economy As a result, retailers' sales have been a soft spot in an otherwise strong economy. Consumer spending, which also includes expenditures for food, medical care, autos, utilities, transportation and other necessities, is watched closely because it accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said July generally is not an important month for retailers. But this month will be critical, especially for apparel retailers who have been in a year-long slump as women turned away from the retailers' offerings of shorter skirts and clothes shoppers widely perceived as boring. The retailers have revamped their fall lines, and analysts predict there will be a pickup in clothing sales that may begin showing up in the stores' August results. `` I would expect sales would accelerate,'' <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> said. `` I am looking for a good August.'' In their reports Thursday, several retailers recorded sales increases under 3 percent _ meaning the stores were losing ground to inflation, which has run at an annual rate of 4.4 percent so far this year. The nation's largest retailer, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said its overall sales rose 7.2 percent last month and 5.4 percent for the first half of the fiscal year, compared with the same periods of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' sales for stores open at least a year, so-called same-store sales, were up 2.5 percent last month and 2.1 percent for the year so far. Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are a more accurate yardstick of a company's performance than figures which include sales from new stores. K mart <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 4.8 percent last month and 5.3 percent during the first half, while same-store sales edged up 0.7 percent in July and 1.8 percent for the year to date. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 30 percent in July and 31 percent for the first half. Same-store sales rose 14 percent last month and 12 percent so far this year. <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 2.7 percent in July and 2.6 percent for the first six months Same-store sales were up 2.1 percent last month and 1.6 percent in the first half. <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales were up 13.1 percent last month, and 17.6 percent for the year to date. The company's same-store sales slipped 0.9 percent during July, while rising 1.5 percent over the first half May <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 23.5 percent in July, and 12 percent over the first half. Same-stores sales increased 4 percent for the month, and 1.2 percent so far this year. F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported an 11.1 percent sales gain for July, and an 11.9 increase for the first six months. <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its sales rose 1 percent last month, and 2.8 percent over the first half.

<HEAD>Business Week Tells Its Side Of Scandal Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Business Week says it has not uncovered any evidence implicating its editorial employees in a spreading scandal involving pre-publication leaks of the magazine's stock tips, and again has defended its actions in dealing internally with its suspicions without telling authorities. The magazine in its Aug. 15 issue, released to the press late Thursday, gave its first detailed account of the scandal, two weeks after first confirming it was investigating the leaks. So far, seven people around the nation have been forced from their jobs in connection with the magazine scandal, and federal law enforcement officials have begun a criminal investigation. Evidence uncovered so far suggests some printers at two of the four plants that print Business Week peddled unpublished copies to brokers, who bought stocks recommended by the `` Inside Wall Street'' column and sold them later at a profit after publication attracted more buyers and boosted the price of the stocks. In the Aug. 15 issue, Business Week estimated that price changes in 20 stocks mentioned in the column this year generated potential profits of $ 2.4 million. `` Few appear to have made a killing,'' the magazine said. Business Week, which is published by <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said its editors detected questionable price changes in stocks mentioned in the column as far back as early last year. But the magazine's editors met with <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, who recommended against reporting the matter to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, Business Week said. The story said Business Week had nothing but suspicions about stock price movements and had no concrete evidence implicating anyone. While Business Week was under no legal obligation to notify the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, the story said, magazine editors also were concerned that an investigation `` might raise First Amendment problems,'' namely that investigators might demand the names of confidential sources of <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcial </PERSON>, who regularly writes the column. Instead, the magazine attempted to `` police its own shop'' by sharply reducing the number of Business Week copies distributed in the <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> building before the official release date from 600 to 20. The magazine also sent letters to its printers citing `` the widespread concern about insider trading'' and reminding them of the confidentiality policy. Business Week said the suspicious trading seemed to subside for awhile, but then reappeared this past spring. The price moves attracted the attention of the Stock Watch department of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which began its own inquiry but did not notify Business Week or the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, the story said. The Dow Jones Professional Investor Report made the first public disclosure of the suspicious stock movements in a story July 21, Business Week finally confirmed its own probe and the scandal began snowballing.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, forced to pay a record $ 6.85 million fine for overbilling insurance companies and thousands of consumers for the costs of repairing damaged rental cars, says it has cleaned up its business practices. A federal judge on Thursday slapped the auto rental giant with the fine and required it to pay restitution that brings <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION>' total bill to more than $ 20 million, after the company pleaded guilty to bilking customers and insurance companies with fraudulently inflated collision repair charges <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> cheated customers out of more than $ 13 million between Jan. 1, 1978 and the summer of 1985, when it learned that a federal grand jury was investigating the company, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, told a news conference. Those who paid money to <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> because of auto-body damage during the period may be eligible for a refund ranging from a few dollars to several thousand dollars, according to assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jonny </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who led the investigation. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said the $ 6.85 million fine was believed to be the largest ever imposed in a consumer fraud case. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON> assessed the penalty during a proceeding in which the company pleaded guilty to mail fraud and agreed to make restitution. <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON> said that within the next 15 days <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> must deposit $ 13.7 million into a special fund to be disbursed to individuals and insurance companies that were overcharged. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> will have to to pay even more if the fund is insufficient, the judge said. `` Today's action by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> attorney's office is deeply disturbing to me and everyone at <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, chairman of the company, said in a statement. `` We regret that improper practices took place and are fully committed to making full refunds of all overcharges.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION>, said low-level managers in the company had been responsible for the overbilling and top executives had been unaware of the practices. Everyone responsible for the problem has been fired, he said. The investigation began when a woman fired on another matter from a <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> reported the billing practices to the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an organization funded by the insurance industry. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> and the other officials declined to identify the woman. In a related state case, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to make an additional $ 2 million in restitution to some 10,000 customers who paid for repairs between June 1, 1985, and May 31, 1986. The company consented to the order in an agreement with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and 40 other states. In that case, the company admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to make the refunds. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said that during the period, <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> charged `` prevailing retail prices for repairs'' when the actual repair cost was about 22 percent less. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said that after <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> learned in 1985 that it was the subject of a federal grand jury probe, it altered the fine print in its rental contract to show it was charging more for repairs than it was paying. This ended the company's criminal activity, but left it open to the state attorneys general civil action, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. In the federal case, <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> admitted using phony damage claims, altered documents and inflated repair bills to charge higher prices than it paid to repair automobiles damaged in accidents. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> employed a number of techniques to defraud its customers, prosecutors said. Without informing its car renters, <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> sent to customers who were involved in an accident or to their insurance companies damage appraisals that did not reflect discounts the company received because it operated large fleets of vehicles. The company also programmed a computer to produce inflated damage-repair estimates. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> also prepared appraisals only on the basis of photographs or accident reports to set the billed cost of repairing a damaged car, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> disguised these phony appraisals as legitimate by forging appraisers signatures. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said it was not criminal for an automobile rental company to earn a profit on repairs, but said <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> acted illegally by failing to inform its customers and by submitting fraudulent documents. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> said it now bills only for its actual cost of repairs and has discontinued the other illegal practices. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said the case should serve as a warning to other companies. `` We do not believe that the practices are limited to the <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Some of these practices were industrywide,'' he said.

<HEAD>Accounting Firm Helping Business Schools Expand Ethics Education</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the world's biggest accounting firms is spearheading a $ 5 million program to help smaller colleges and universities improve their teaching of business ethics, prompted by a survey indicating that ethics programs were `` a little spotty.'' Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has developed PACE, a five-year program of seminars aimed at helping faculty at business schools nationwide to make ethics instruction part of their basic course work. <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kullberg </PERSON>, the firm's managing partner and chief executive officer, said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> views the program partly as an investment in its own future. `` As one of the nation's largest employers of business school graduates, we have a significant interest in their development,'' <PERSON> Kullberg </PERSON> said. `` This program benefits <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> as well as the business community in general.'' Wall Street's insider-trading scandals and shady defense-contract deals have focused public attention on moral issues in business. But while many graduate business schools have responded by introducing ethics courses _ often as electives for MBA candidates _ few small colleges and public universities can match the resources of the leading private business schools in developing such programs. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, for example, received a $ 30 million gift last year from former <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S.R </PERSON>. Shad to finance a program in ethics education. But <PERSON> Kullberg </PERSON> said an Andersen-financed survey found the development of ethics-education in the business curriculums of smaller colleges and public universities to be `` a little spotty.'' `` There is a desire to find a solution, a desire to find a practical way to deal with the subject,'' he said in a telephone interview this week. So <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> developed the PACE program and invited business-school instructors from around the nation to review it. Some 300 of them came to the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area this spring and summer at <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s expense to attend two-day seminars on incorporating ethics lessons into their routine course work. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> has asked the approximately 60 institutions that sent representatives to this year's seminars to try the PACE approach for at least one semester. The team of ethics teachers, business school instructors and business professionals who developed PACE decided ethics should be taught as part of the five basic business disciplines: finance, marketing, economics, management and accounting. `` I see that as a big plus,'' said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Doenges </PERSON>, a professor of finance at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> who attended a PACE seminar. In real life, <PERSON> Doenges </PERSON> said, `` ethical issues can arise at any point at almost any time.'' By incorporating ethics discussions into finance courses, he said, `` the student sees ethical issues as a part of finance, as a part of his normal business life rather than as a segmented or compartmented area of study.'' To foster discussions, PACE offers fictitious case studies tailored to each discipline. The case studies are meant to reflect ethical dilemmas that business students might face early in their careers, such as sexual harassment, truth in advertising, plant closings, wage discrimination and ledger manipulation. The dilemmas have no easy or correct solutions, but are designed to get students talking and thinking. `` Students need to grapple with these issues so they can have some experience in thinking about these issues,'' said <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON>, an assistant professor of accounting at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fuqua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> DePaul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and a member of the PACE development group, said the PACE program was designed to give business students the basic skill to deal with ethical dilemmas, just as they learned the basic skills of management and accounting. `` We believe very strongly that most ethical problems that arise come from lack of information and that lack of information results in poor judgment,'' he said. `` We're trying to provide the information that will help alleviate those bad judgments.''

The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filed a civil suit alleging that Towers failed to satisfy disclosure requirements when it publicly sold $ 20 million in notes between October 1986 and October 1987. Towers is a factoring firm, which buys accounts receivable at a discount and earns a profit by collecting the full face amount. `` We say they financed a factoring program with an unlawful securities offering and we want them to stop,'' said <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Gettinger </PERSON>, a staff attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to bar Towers from using the money it received in the securities sales and to issue an injunction barring the company from further violation of federal registration requirements.
