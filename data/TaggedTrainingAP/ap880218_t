 About 60,000 demonstrators gathered Thursday night in the main Zocalo plaza to protest the government's new inflation-fighting program which has sparked higher prices throughout the economy. The protesters demanded that the government place controls on prices, nearly triple the minimum daily wage and halt payments on its foreign debt of $ 105 billion, the second highest in the developing world after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. There were no reports of arrests or violence. <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON>, who spoke on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said the government of President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> has `` stabbed the people by implementing the -LRB- Economic Solidarity -RRB- Pact.'' He said de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s Cabinet should be fired because it `` has brought the country to disaster.'' The resistance front represents the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> and a dissident wing of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, who left the governing party to run as the presidential candidate of small opposition parties, was among the protest leaders. The Economic Solidarity Pact was put into effect in mid-December. As part of the plan, the government boosted prices on a variety of regulated goods and services by an average of 78 percent. The minimum daily wage was boosted 38 percent and now stands at 7,765 pesos, about $ 3.40. On March 1, the government will begin an indexation plan that will increase wages and prices a certain amount each month based on projected inflation. The government's aim is to reduce the monthly rate of inflation to 1 percent to 2 percent by year's end. Consumer prices soared 15.5 percent in January. Prices rose a record 159.2 percent last year. Private analysts estimate that workers have lost half their purchasing power since 1982. <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that inflation is `` the most serious problem we face'' and will be managed `` in a prudent, sensible and realistic way.'' De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> spoke during an appearance in <LOCATION> Toluca </LOCATION>, 45 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Despite the government's efforts, some private analysts predict that inflation will be in the range of 150 percent to 200 percent this year. Labor leaders are threatening massive strikes in March unless major salary increases are granted.

 Police on Thursday detained and questioned two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women working in a resettlement camp then turned them over to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. An Episcopal minister, the Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, identified the two as <PERSON> Kathleene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Parmenter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He claimed their detention was a part of increased harassment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ecumenical workers by Salvadoran authorities in recent months. The two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> women were detained `` for entering restricted areas without authorization,'' said agent <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, whose jurisdiction includes investigations of customs and immigration violations. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said they were apprehended at the Copapayo camp near <LOCATION> Suchitoto </LOCATION>, about 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Guerrillas frequently carry out operations in the area. He said the women, along with seven Salvadorans, were detained Thursday morning and brought to the capital. The two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were released into the custody of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Vice Consul <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Schall </PERSON> after several hours of questioning, he said. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said the Privacy Act prevented him from confirming the women's names or details of the incident. But he agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> report that two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women were detained and later released. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, chairman of a diocesan task force for Salvadoran resettlement, said he was informed of the detention by telephone by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He said the military has been harassing Americans providing humanitarian assistance in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since about 20,000 Salvadoran refugees in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> decided to return to their homeland last fall. `` Since then, the government nervousness and harassment of ecumenical workers has increased ... Our concern is that this kind of caseworker harassment has happened to others who are strictly down there for humanitarian reasons,'' he said. Guerillas from five leftist groups have been fighting since 1980 to overthrow the U.S.-backed government.

 History buffs organizing re-enactments of major Civil War battles this summer are running into the same problem <PERSON> Gens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> faced 125 years ago _ not enough <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebs </PERSON> to go around. `` There are so many re-enactments planned that you could stay busy just about every weekend,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a member of `` <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Battery.'' But the Civil War fanatics who dress up in blue or gray to camp out and charge through fields in battlefield re-enactments have a manpower solution that was not available in the Civil War _ fight for both sides. `` Sometimes you have to hastily reorganize your loyalties if you want to be part of something,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who in more sedate moments is chairman of the social studies department at <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` This summer is an especially busy period because two of the key battles of the Civil War _ <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> _ occurred at virtually the same time,'' he said. <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> activities will take place in the weeks leading up to the 125th anniversary of the battle, which was fought July 1-3, 1863, while the <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> re-enactment is planned for the July Fourth weekend, when that Rebel stronghold on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> fell to <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s army. Last year more than 40,000 people watched as 6,000 buffs recreated the bloody battle of <LOCATION> Shiloh </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, where Confederate troops surprised <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s troops on April 6, 1862. The Rebels were defeated in a two-day battle. Thousands of re-enactors belong to groups of Civil War buffs, but demand has been so intense that several events, including an annual re-creation of the Battle of Champion Hill, have had to be rescheduled. Champion <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was fought on May 16, 1863, and paved the way to <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> for Union troops. It will be observed in March this year because it would have conflicted with preparations for the <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> event. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that to deal with changing demands, many re-enactors carry two sets of uniforms so that at a moment's notice they can march as either a Rebel or a Yankee. Leyland French, operator of an antebellum tour home here, said that by staging <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> activities immediately after those at <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, `` It may be possible for more people to make both events.'' `` We've talked with representives of 41st Illinois Infantry who plan a weekend encampment and we had a call this week from a gentleman in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> who wants to bring a group,'' said <PERSON> Lenore </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Vicksburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> and Visitors' Bureau. While <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> is perhaps the best-remembered clash of the Civil War, the fall of <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> on July 4, 1863, was a vital strategic loss to the South, leaving the Confederacy almost cut in two and giving control of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to the North. The siege began May 18, 1863, and ended when Confederate Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pemberton </PERSON>, out of food and water, surrendered on July Fourth. The battle, fought in trenches, enventually involved 100,000 men, some 50,000 fewer than marched into battle at <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> was turned back. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that despite the expense of uniforms, equipment and the time and travel, most re-enactors were anxious to participate in as many events as possible. `` We are talking about salesmen, bookkeepers, teachers, truck drivers, doctors, and lawyers _ all united by a common love of history,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` It's like a time machine, providing a feeling of history you ca n't get any other way,'' he said. He said many buffs, both from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, preferred to march as Confederates, perhaps because of the romance of the Lost Cause. `` Re-enactors were used when they made the television movie <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, and just about everyone wanted to be a Confederate, including most of the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` In the end, they had to make our group go in as Union troops.''

 As <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> enters the Year of the Dragon, the symbol of good fortune is everywhere in the capital _ in neon and plastic, on posters and in newspapers _ despite the official communist line against superstitious beliefs. The dragon is considered the most auspicious of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, and it continues to be <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s favorite symbol of luck, power and grandeur. The Chinese, who call themselves `` descendents of the dragon,'' regard the dragon year as lucky for marriage, birth and business. Throughout <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, neon dragons beam from atop buildings, plastic dragons twine around pillars, and the character for dragon is on signs welcoming the new year. Red banner headlines in Chinese newspapers Wednesday hailed the start of the new lunar year and devoted extensive space to articles on the dragon's history, development and significance. Even the state-run <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Review linked the dragon to hoped-for economic success this year. On the cover of the authoritative magazine's Feb. 15 issue, the headline read, `` Coastal Areas: Boom expected in Year of Dragon.'' The dragon's role in Chinese culture dates back as early as the New Stone Age. A dragon made of shells was discovered last year in a tomb from the 7,000 year-old <LOCATION> Yangshao </LOCATION> civilization unearthed in <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> province. In dynastic times, the yellow dragon was the symbol of the emperor, and anyone found using the motif was punished severely. It is said that no mortal has ever seen the dragon, but ancient writers described the dragon as having the antlers of a deer, the head of a camel, the eyes of a ghost, the neck of a serpent, the belly of a sea snake, the scales of a carp, the claws of an eagle, the paws of a tiger and the ears of a bull. Artists portrayed this fantastic creature in a variety of ways, but most dragons look something like reptilian serpent with four sharp-clawed feet and a horse-like head with sharp horns. The dragon is one of the most prominent figures in Chinese art, architecture, clothing and even furniture, and it remains an important symbol to the Chinese. A pair of red dragons flying amid clouds dominated the top corner of the Wednesday edition of the official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, mouthpiece of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Other national newspapers published photographs of dragon dances and spectacular dragon lanterns. A five-hour Spring Festival television special Tuesday night showed dragon ice sculptures in <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION> province, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s northeasternmost major city, and fiery dragon dances in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>. A 10-part TV series on the dragon will be shown across the nation. The Forbidden City, formerly the imperial palace, is holding a <ORGANIZATION> Dragon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exhibition </ORGANIZATION>, and a display at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> shows how the dragon is depicted in the folk art of the Miao minority people from southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s major cities and tourist centers, dragons of all sizes and shapes adorn doorways to hotels and tourist shops, grinning from signs welcoming tourists. Special dragon-related activities are planned throughout the year, which officials have designated The International Year of Tourism. Visitors will be treated to events ranging from a dragon kite show in <LOCATION> Weifang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province, to traditional dragon boat races in several major cities.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s controversial family planning policies have failed for the second straight year. The growing willingness of couples to defy the one-child limit threatens to send the population zooming out of control. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has estimated that to hold its population within the planned limit of 1.2 billion in 2000 and 1.5 billion in 2050, it must keep the birth rate below 1.5 percent. But the birth rate hit 2 percent in 1986 and stayed there in 1987. If that pace is maintained, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1 billion people will become 2 billion by 2030, according to a recent estimate by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Fund for Population Activities. In a recent front-page commentary, the official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> declared the family planning situation was `` out of control'' in some provinces. `` One false move may lose the game,'' it said. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s continuously growing population is in fact facing a crisis. The surge is fueled largely by newly prosperous peasants who have enough money to pay government fines for breaking the one-child limit and incentives under the new economic reforms to do so. Since the breakup of communes in the early 1980s, families have been responsible for farming their own plots of land. More children to help plant and harvest means more profit. Even urban residents, who surveys indicate are less eager than peasants to have large families, envy the ease with which newly rich peasants have been able to `` buy'' extra children. Fines vary from region to region but generally amount to about $ 270 per year for five years. The amount is n't prohibitive if several family members chip in. The average rural income is about $ 270 per couple, but annual family incomes of several times that amount are increasingly common. City residents face not only fines but suspension from work for one or two years for having a second child. Officials responded to the high 1986 birth rate with calls for better birth control education. But when the 1987 figures came out, the family planning minister, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON>, was sacked. The government also announced measures to tighten local enforcement of the one-child limit by linking it to officials' paychecks At an urgent meeting of family planning officials early this year, acting Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> ordered that officials be rewarded or punished based on how well they enforce the one-child policy. But <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities, sensitive about past <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional charges of coerced abortions, said at a recent news conference that officials will not be rewarded for high numbers of abortions in their jurisdictions. `` Efforts are to be made to raise the use of birth control and contraceptive methods and reduce the number of abortions,'' said <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s general office. He insisted that only `` education and persuasion'' would be used to encourage abortions when families already have a child. In an apparent reflection of the new tough attitude, medical workers in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said hospitals recently have begun refusing admission to women about to give birth to a second or third child. Family planning authorities also have gotten tougher on migrant worker families who have taken advantage of their roving status to flout the one-child limit. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said some migrant couples have as many as five or six children. In the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION>, officials ruled in January that employers must issue `` planned birth cards'' to all migrant workers so their family sizes can be recorded and monitored. Family planning education programs have been stepped up. Almost the only propaganda posters still seen in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are those touting the one-child policy. <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, mindful that half of all Chinese homes have televisions, broadcast weekly programs on family planning last year. But a combination of demographics and superstition make it likely births will increase rather than drop in 1988. The population of child-bearing women increased by 7 million in 1987 and will grow by 8 million this year, to 297 million, as the products of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s baby boom of the 1960s reach maturity. Furthermore, 1988 is the year of the dragon in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s traditional 12-year astrological cycle The dragon is a symbol of good luck and power, and many young couples are expected to try to have their one child this year. The official Workers' Daily recently tried to debunk traditional beliefs about lucky `` dragon babies.'' If birth control limits are ignored, it warned, `` the dragon year will not be lucky for an over-populated nation.''

 Comedian <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> and singer <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> were among the friends who gathered to remember composer <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON> as a man who could make life laugh and sing like the Broadway musicals he helped create. `` The tragedy of my life is that I never did get to do a musical with him,'' <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, stage star of `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>,'' and `` The Sound of Music,'' told about 75 friends and fans at an outdoor memorial service at <LOCATION> Loewe </LOCATION>'s estate here Wednesday. <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, a friend for 32 years, called <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON>'s music `` the pomp and splendor of life _ a celestial sound that inspires happiness.'' <PERSON> Loewe </PERSON>, who combined his music with the words of <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> to create such Broadway classics as `` Brigadoon,'' `` My Fair Lady,'' `` Paint Your Wagon'' and `` Camelot,'' died Sunday of heart failure.

 Happy noises hum down the halls of the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and filter into the paneled office. Principal <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> stops her paperwork to listen attentively. A substantial, gray-haired woman, she seems frozen in her swivel chair as she strains to catch the sounds coming from the classrooms, a buzz of song, recitation and prayer. Relaxing after a moment, she nods approvingly. A smile melts the concentration that had creased her forehead. `` Yes,'' she says. `` It's a good sound, the sound of children learning.'' A bell rings and the halls are filled with children. The girls are immaculately dressed in green plaid jumpers and white blouses. The boys wear green pants, white shirts and black ties. The children have something in common besides the uniforms: All 482 have dark skins. `` Welcome to the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, the only large-scale, all-black, private <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> school I know of,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON>, the 53-year-old founder and driving force behind the school. `` Our motto is ` All things are possible within the Lord.''' The non-profit academy is housed in a one-story brick building atop a hill near downtown <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>. Until 1983, the building was a public elementary school. Progressive Christian is leasing it with an option to buy. `` You're looking at a miracle here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> said proudly as she walked down the hall, past photographs of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>. `` This place was a total wreck when we moved in 18 months ago. Now we're a family. We're also a vital education center that is serving the needs of black children.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> said she came to perceive those needs in the 18 years she was a public schoolteacher and principal. `` It was clear to me that the public school system was n't providing the moral guidance, the loving discipline and the positive self-image reinforcement that many children need in order to flourish,'' she said In the summer of 1985, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> took the plunge with $ 50,000 in savings and loans. She opened a trial summer school at the <LOCATION> Progressive </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, where her husband is pastor. `` We had 75 children and taught remedial reading and math with an emphasis on Christian principles and the development of positive self-esteem,'' she said. `` It was incredible. I began to see a change in those children on a daily basis and so did their parents. They kept telling me their kids were so excited about the school that they did n't even have to get them up in the mornings. `` That fall I quit my job -LRB- as principal of an integrated public magnet school -RRB- and opened this school, which goes from K4 -LRB- pre-kindergarten -RRB- through the eighth grade. We started with 175 students. By the summer of'86, we had 400 students enrolled and had to move out of the church. Now, with 482 students and 38 employees, we've got cramped quarters once again.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> is one of four mostly black private schools, including a tiny class run by Seventh-day Adventists, in <LOCATION> Bibb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Some 5,000 of the county's 30,000 school-age children attend private schools, most of them white. `` Most of our children came to us from the public schools, where many were doing poorly,'' she said. `` They were developing poor self-images and their parents were afraid their children were going to be lost.'' <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, a sixth-grader, feels he was one such student. `` I was a little mouse. I was so scared I just could n't speak up,'' he recalled of his three years in public school. `` I had a white teacher in the first grade who told my parents I was retarded. She and the kids used to make fun of me. Now I'm on the honor roll, and I know I'm not retarded.'' Other students said they had to work harder at <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and had fewer social and athletic activities yet still preferred their private school to public classrooms. `` The kids here are n't as mad as they were in public school,'' said <PERSON> Latonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Raines </PERSON>, an eighth-grader. `` And the teachers really seem to care about you here.'' <LOCATION> Bibb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, who worked to integrate the county's schools two decades ago, said he found the present situation ironic. `` I've got two grandchildren in Mrs. <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON>'s school, including a grandson who was n't doing well in public school,'' <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> said. `` My grandson is doing much better now that he's in the private school.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> said her school, in addition to providing a Christian atmosphere, gives the children positive role models. `` They get to see black people in charge,'' she said. `` We also strive to instill in them the belief that everybody is somebody special. We stress the worth of the individual.'' She said her school also accommodates the students' special needs and schedules. `` For one thing, she said, `` we're open from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m., which especially helps single parents. We provide a warm, loving atmosphere, but we also stress academics and have volunteer tutors for high-risk failures. Then, too, we supervise the homework of those students who stay after school.'' She said the parents pay $ 30 a week for one child and $ 50 for two or more. They must provide books, uniforms and lunches for their children. Several mothers, interviewed as a group, agreed they were thrilled with the school even though tuition money is hard to spare. `` My little boy is happy now. There has n't been a day he has n't gotten up and gotten himself ready for school Morning can be an especially tense time for a single parent, and I simply ca n't tell you how much this means to me,'' said <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coggins </PERSON>, a Social Security claims examiner with two children at the school. Mrs. <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> said parents of eighth-graders want her to offer high school classes so children wo n't have to return to public school. `` I'm also getting requests from parents outside the area to start a boarding school,'' she added. `` I'd like to do that, but first we need to raise enough money to pay off our bills and complete our library, which we need to do to be fully accredited.'' The school now has provisional accreditation and plans a library fund-raising drive. `` I feel certain these things will all come in time. Meanwhile, I must be doing something right. It's all I can do, when I go out in the hall, not to get knocked down by all the hugs I get.''

<TEXT>
 An inventor who claims he has devised a machine that produces more energy than it uses says he will appeal a judge's refusal to force the government to give him a patent for his invention. `` I am pleased the judge has finally ruled because I am counting on getting up to the higher court,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said Wednesday after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> rejected his lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trademark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was very certain he was going to be consistent and rule against me,'' said <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>, Miss. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> upheld the <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to grant a patent for the device, saying there was insufficient scientific evidence to support <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s claim the machine converted matter into energy. Patent examiners rejected <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s application after ruling that such a machine would violate the second law of thermodynamics. That law of physics holds that energy is inevitably consumed by any mechanical process so that a machine can not produce more energy than is used to power it. The same law rules out the existence of similar, so-called `` perpetual motion'' machines that some inventors have claimed at various times to have produced. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON>, contended that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had improperly rejected the findings of court-appointed expert <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuyler </PERSON>, himself a former patent commissioner, that the machine worked as <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> claimed it did. `` We have an expert ... who agrees with our view and we have a district court judge's opinion that differs with that,'' <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> said. `` So I think we will have to go the Court of Appeals for a tie-breaker.'' Ruling on the five-year-old lawsuit, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> had only produced evidence to support his theory that was `` anecdotal and largely qualitative rather than quantified measured data.'' Nor had <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, the judge found, rebutted the findings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION>, which tested the machine and concluded: `` The device did not deliver more energy than it used.'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, who has demonstrated his motor to a congressional subcommittee, claims that it converts matter he calls `` gyroscopic particles'' into energy. But the judge found that `` aside from <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s own somewhat metaphysical writings which appear at multiple points throughout his patent application there is no evidence whatsoever ... from which to find the existence of such ` gyroscopic particles,' their observable -LRB- or measurable -RRB- ` release' or ` reaction' within the device.'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s machine resembles an ordinary electric motor except for a large coil of wire used to create an electromagnetic field when powered by batteries. `` At best,'' the judge said, `` the evidence supports a finding that <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s device will operate, for reasons not explained at all but must be merely guessed at, on dry cell batteries for longer periods of time than others which may or may not be comparable. `` But such a device is not the one for which <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> seeks a patent,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in his 20-page opinion. `` He is unequivocal in his insistence that the device he has tendered as patent-worthy produces more useable energy output than the energy required to power it. The court finds the evidence of it insufficient.'' The bitterly fought lawsuit included a 1986 episode when <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> was cited for contempt of court for pressing <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s demand that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> disqualify himself from the case because he was biased `` I have had just about enough of your insolence in this case,'' the judge told <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> later withdrew the contempt citation.

 Government officials and businessmen say charges they enriched themselves on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid are false or misleading and were timed to embarrass <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted on rebel funding. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> sources and several other businessmen say some of the accusations are true. Local officials are reacting angrily to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memo which charges that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> misspent and mismanaged millions of dollars in foreign aid, including providing college scholarships for children of influential citizens and creating a development agency that largely benefited politicians. A Costa Rican government spokesman, who agreed to be interviewed only on condition of anonymity, said no formal response was planned until the memo can be clarified. `` When something like this hits the public, people have the right not only to feel angry but to feel extremely angry,'' he said. The memo said actions by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and wealthy and influential Costa Ricans who helped distribute the aid `` closely approach criminal conduct.'' Portions of the memo first were disclosed in a story written by the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and published in several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspapers in late January, just two weeks before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted on an aid proposal for rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. The Associated Press carried a lengthy story on the memo last week from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected the Contra rebel proposal in early February. But Costa Rican officials say release of the memo before the vote was designed to muddy the image of the country and its president, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who has been an influential opponent of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Contra policy. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> won the Nobel Peace Prize last fall for a <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace plan that forbids foreign funding of rebel groups in the region and calls for a negotiated political settlement to the area's conflicts. The peace plan has, at least temporarily, pre-empted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy of using military pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The confidential memo was written Oct. 9, 1987, by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckington </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, known as AID, that distributes the money. In the memo, <PERSON> Beckington </PERSON> claimed the former AID director in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaij </PERSON>, personally approved loans and grants that benefited some of the country's most prominent business and political figures. Most of the alleged activities took place before <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> was elected in 1986. After the memo was first published Jan. 20, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, questioned `` why confidential reports supplied more than four months ago should be leaked to the press at this particular time. <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s finance minister, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON>, told reporters that the story was `` a complete unmitigated lie.'' Both <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON> were identified as beneficiaries of AID programs. Several sources in the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> government and private sector say they believe some of the accusations are valid. `` There was some poor judgment used in how they decided some of these projects,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Other officials said parts of the memo were false and written in inflammatory language to make legitimate activities appear illegal or questionable. They said a second audit exonerated many of the people mentioned in the Oct. 9 memo, but the audit has not been released. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a Costa Rican business executive also named in the memo, said some of the facts in it appear to be true, but were `` mischievously distorted and given sinister and malicious interpretations.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and others said one example is a charge that a small group of Costa Ricans set up a system by which they were able to evade local taxes on money earned from AID contracts. They said the memo made the practice seem illegal, although it is a legally established tax shelter system in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. `` It is not done this way in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> it is,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` It's a shelter _ legal, decent, upheld by law. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, but the insinuations made in the memo are insidious.'' Legislators in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are planning investigations into how AID money was used in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The Costa Ricans say they also will look into why the critical memo was leaked to the press.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the oil industry have narrowly bested the environmentalists in Round 1 of their intense fight over petroleum development in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>. The administration's victory came Wednesday as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 10-9 to open the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain to oil rigs, a controversial step that the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> have been urging on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a year. Under the committee's plan, drilling rigs could join the caribou and musk oxen on the refuge's frigid tundra as early as 21 months after enactment of a law repealing the current prohibition against development in the refuge. The issue has become a major battleground. The environmental lobby is trying to protect the fragile ecosystem from any development. The other side says the area's potentially huge reserves could rival those of nearby <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, which accounts for about 20 percent of domestic oil production. Drilling foes like Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., said that even though the committee was readying legislation for the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, they think they can hold their ground this year in hope that the next president will oppose development In fact, <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action in 1988 may be academic: `` Nothing's going to happen this year in the House _ zero. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is n't going to bring it up.'' <PERSON> Syd </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, conservation vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said that while he was disappointed in the committee action, `` I'm real happy with the division: a 10-9 vote is not a clear mandate for opening ANWR.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the oil industry's lobbying arm, said in a statement that `` the committee has taken a step toward ensuring the future energy security and economic well-being of our country. ... The time has come to proceed with the legislation. We urge the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to move expeditiously.'' <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> and his allies tried to persuade the committee to defer a decision on drilling until the administration could study the nation's long-term energy needs and formulate a policy to meet them. But Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, the point man for the development forces, told the committee in a letter that new oil from the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> is needed under any scenario, including increased conservation. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> criticized the direction being taken by the committee as it continues work on the refuge legislation. He objected to proposals for detailed environmental safeguards and a 10-year stretchout in the oil-tract leasing process. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> was also critical of a decision made two weeks ago by the committee to earmark 80 percent of the federal revenues from refuge oil to conservation and species protection programs, with only 20 percent available for general use. `` ANWR's resources belong to all Americans,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. `` Federal revenues generated by an ANWR leasing program should go to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> where they can benefit all taxpayers and serve national priorities.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he did not know whether <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s problems with the bill could lead to a recommendation that it be vetoed. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> officials were pleased by Wednesday's vote because `` we're still moving in the general direction we want to go.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Reagan Budget Reveals Hoped-for Legacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The budget President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today is n't likely to survive long but it embodies a philosophy of government that he hopes will be a legacy of his administration. It also demonstrates some changes in approach that the president has either embraced or had thrust upon him since he took office more than seven years ago. The budget makes a strong pitch for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s long-held position that government should not perform functions which, in his conservative view of things, can be done better by private organizations. It proposes, for instance, the `` complete privatization'' of military housing and construction of waste water treatment plants. It also calls for a new private entity to mediate disputes that now choke the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In line with his firm belief in an economy governed by market forces, the president reiterates proposals to cut back federal programs that prop up commodity prices and protect farmers' incomes. And, as he so often has, he calls for the elimination of federal programs that he says are unneeded. This time he lists nine of them, ranging from the rural housing insurance fund to discretionary grants for urban mass transit. Notable by its absence, however, is the idea, which he put forward in 1982, of abolishing the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Instead, the president proposes an increase of $ 650 million over the current appropriation of $ 16.2 billion for the department's discretionary programs Adopting arguments of Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> now says education and training are one of the highest priorities of the federal government. Under a compromise worked out with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the president agrees to a slowdown in the military buildup that has been a hallmark of his administration. But he pointedly says in his budget message that he wants the full $ 229.5 billion compromise figure appropriated, declaring, `` I have kept my side of the bargain and trust that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will keep its side.'' As he enters the twilight of his presidency, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has increasingly expressed his commitment, most recently in a speech to conservative political activists last week, to making what has been called the `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution'' of restrained government a permanent feature of American life. However that may be, the particulars of his budget blueprint undoubtedly are in for drastic alteration by a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, controlled in both houses by the opposition party, facing a president whose political clout is weakened as he nears the end of his tenure. In his budget message, the president says that `` the budget process has so degenerated in recent years that the presidential budget is routinely discarded'' after it arrives on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. What the president calls degeneration many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would describe as a healthy assertion of their constitutional power over the purse strings. Either way, however, it makes the president's budget more of an outline of goals and philosophy than a map of actual spending for the fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1 and last for more than eight months after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office.

<TEXT>
 Leftist guerrillas have struck 20 times in the past five weeks at the lifeline of the nation's oil industry _ a 500-mile pipeline that runs through some of the most rugged terrain in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The attacks have raised the question of whether this South American nation will be able to maintain its oil exports. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has blown up parts of the pipeline 13 times since Jan. 12, temporarily shutting down the line and forcing <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to suspend its 137,000 barrels a day of oil exports. Another seven attacks did not damage the pipeline, according to sources with <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons. The pipeline carries oil from the <LOCATION> Canon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Limon </LOCATION> field in the northeast state of <LOCATION> Arauca </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Covenas </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast. The field is owned half by the state oil company <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION> and half by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Canon </PERSON> <PERSON> Limon </PERSON>, discovered four years ago by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>, was one of the world's biggest oil discoveries in a decade. With a billion barrels of reserves, it was hailed as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s economic salvation. At the time, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION>, appeared to be a ragtag band of rebels. The series of attacks has shown that the <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> has grown considerably in strength and that the army is incapable of defending the pipeline. The bombings have caused 100,000 barrels of oil to be spilled, much of it into rivers and streams. The pipeline was put into service Dec. 7, 1986, allowing <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to export oil for the first time since 1972. The <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limon </ORGANIZATION> field is capable of producing 300,000 barrels of oil a day, but <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION> initially limited production to 180,000 barrels a day. That limit was increased to 215,000 barrels in December. An <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION> source said the limit will be raised to 300,000 barrels a day sometime this year. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because all information about the pipeline is supposed to come from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which refused to comment. Between December 1986 and December 1987, there were about 40 dynamite attacks on the pipeline. Many bombs did n't go off. The few that exploded did little damage, and the pipeline would be out of service for only a few hours. But between Jan. 12 and Jan. 29, the <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> attacked the pipeline every day. On Jan. 12 there were two explosions that caused a spill of 27,200 barrels of oil and forcing <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION> to close down the pipeline. The army and President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said army patrols along the pipeline would be increased. The line was opened again Feb. 5. Barely enough pressure had built up to begin full pumping when an attack on Feb. 9 destroyed 120 feet of pipeline. <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION> was forced to close the pipeline again. It reopened Wednesday, and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> resumed its oil exports, according to a news release issued by the Minister of Mines, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>. Crews in helicopters have little chance of spotting guerrillas in the dense jungles through which the pipe runs. The rebels initially just tried to blow up pipe, but more recently they have started keying on the line's big valves, which can not be repaired or replaced quickly. The <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> first emerged in 1960, shortly after <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s triumph in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> It was organized by a Roman Catholic priest, <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, who was later killed in a battle with troops in 1966. The army estimates that the <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> has fewer than 500 combatants. There are believed to be a total of about 7,000 armed rebels in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s five leftist rebel groups.

<HEAD>Big Companies Endorse Active Role in AIDS Education</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirty employers, including some of the nation's biggest corporations, on Wednesday endorsed a 10-point `` bill of rights'' on AIDS in the workplace formulated by a citizens group The companies committed themselves to taking an active role in educating their employees about AIDS and protecting job rights of AIDS sufferers. Among the principles formulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is a statement that people with AIDS or its virus `` are entitled to the same rights and opportunities as people with other serious or life-threatening illnesses.'' In addition, it states, AIDS victims `` do not pose a risk of transmission of the virus to coworkers through ordinary workplace contact.'' Another principle is that `` employers should provide employees with sensitive, accurate and up-to-date education about risk reduction in their personal lives.'' Requiring workers or job applicants take blood tests for the virus is specifically rejected, as is divulging medical information about an employee. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was the first company to endorse the principles, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucotti </PERSON>, co-chairman of the commission. Others endorsing the principles included <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner-Lambert </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the City of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the teachers' unions of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Also, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shubert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>; Ms., <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, Sassy and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and World Report magazines; <ORGANIZATION> Rubenstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Also, the Girl Scouts, <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Randolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Education Fund, Fund for the City of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Wildcat Services and <ORGANIZATION> Archie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comics </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zucotti </PERSON> said the commission would pursue other employers and umbrella organizations of business and labor to endorse the principles. A number of businesses have asked for time to study the principles and a few rejected them, on grounds they might open themselves to lawsuits, said <PERSON> Zucotti </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zucotti </PERSON> declined to identify the rejecting companies, but a commission member, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, executive director of the Lambda fund for gay rights, said he thought the companies feared stigma more than lawsuits. State and federal statues prohibit discrimination against people who have AIDS but can work, so the principles require no more of a company legally than laws already on the books, <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said. `` Those companies that have subscribed to these principles have been very courageous,'' said <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>. `` They have been willing to take the heat because they understand the gravity of the problem. We will continue to have the problem of stigmatization until all companies subscribe to these principles.'' Proposing and promoting the principles were the first public act of the 15-member commission, which was established in July and funded by 17 local foundations. <PERSON> Zucotti </PERSON> said the commission's mission was to marshal information and mobilize effort to improve care for AIDS sufferers, promote prevention and education about the fatal disease and address its social impact.

<HEAD>Democrats' Contra Aid Package Maintains Current Funding Level</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new package of purely `` humanitarian'' aid being drafted by House Democrats for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels will continue supplying the resistance at the current rate of about $ 1.8 million a month. But House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Wednesday that other crucial questions about the aid package, which is scheduled to come to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor next week, remain unanswered. Unresolved are such difficult issues as how the aid will be delivered, its duration, and what kinds of incentives might be offered to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government to encourage compliance with a regional peace accord. `` It is taking shape,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said of the proposal. A group of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, primarily Democrats, has been meeting daily to work out details of the bill, which was promised as an alternative to the administration's $ 36.2 million aid package rejected on Feb. 4. In contrast with the administration's package, which included $ 3.6 million for ammunition and anti-aircraft missiles and millions more for non-lethal military supplies, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s proposal would be limited to food, clothing and medical supplies and assistance. The $ 1.8 million monthly figure does not include transportation costs, which currently are costing a like amount each month but could be lower if the aid were delivered by an international, neutral organization such as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., who is leading the drafting sessions, said the bill also will include a program to aid children injured during the six-year civil war <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said under consideration as well is a possible lifting of trade sanctions against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and economic aid to other countries in the region, contingent on fulfillment of promises of democratization made in the five-nation peace agreement. But he emphasized that such moves could be made only with the `` enthusiastic'' backing of the administration, which would be charged with carrying them out. So far, the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders have declined to participate in drafting the legislation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the bill will seek to provide `` balanced incentives'' to encourage both the Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to work out a cease-fire and live up to the peace agreement signed last Aug. 7. Both <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> appeared cool to the idea, mentioned earlier by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., that the legislation would include a ban or restriction on fund-raising for the Contras by private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens `` I know of no provision contemplated,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said when asked about the issue. Meanwhile, a congressional opponent of aid to the Contras asked President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to strengthen assurances that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government personnel will not again become mired in private fund raising for the rebels as it did in the Iran-Contra affair. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., also asked that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> clarify the tax-exempt status of a fund the Contras have established to solicit private contributions from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens Last week, White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> issued a memorandum directing that `` no administration official'' provide aid to private fund-raising efforts for the Contras. But because the memorandum was not issued by the president himself and was addressed only to White House and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff members, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> opponents have questioned whether the directive contained an important loophole. Obey, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, noted that federal law prohibits such activity and that all federal officials, including those at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, should be covered by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> prohibition. He also raised questions about the Contras' fund-raising arm, the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Contributions to the fund are tax-deductible. Obey noted that the fund had been created last October simply by changing the name of another organization that already had tax-exempt status, the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is unlikely to agree on a date for the next superpower summit meeting until the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratifies a treaty to ban intermediate-range nuclear missiles, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official says. `` I really think the Soviets probably would wait for the INF ratification,'' the official said Wednesday. `` Do n't ask me why. But I just sense it's going to be important to them to have this process that was started by the signature at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit completed.'' The official, whose identity was shielded under briefing rules at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, referred to the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty to scrap about 2,700 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles. It was signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in December and is before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for ratification. In the meantime, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will hold talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next Sunday and Monday on preparations for their next summit meeting. It is to be held in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, possibly in late May or early June. The centerpiece of that fourth and final meeting between the two leaders is supposed to be a more ambitious treaty to reduce by 30 percent to 50 percent the overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arsenals of long-range bombers, land-based missiles and submarines. But the official said negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> had slowed down for several reasons. The Soviets are trying to restrict <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative, the program to develop a space-based shield against ballistic missiles, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is resisting various restrictions on cruise missiles <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will meet on Sunday with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and on Monday with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. He is due to fly to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Tuesday to brief the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> allies on the results. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, announced <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also will meet with <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the noted Soviet dissident, while he is in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Human rights is high on his agenda,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Mr. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> obviously is a person well-placed to talk about these kind of issues.'' Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government telecast to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said human rights has `` pride of place'' in <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' plans. Other key items are the slowed-down negotations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to produce a new arms control agreement, the prospective withdrawal of 120,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to arrange Arab-Israeli negotiations. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, winner of the Nobel peace prize in 1975, is a physicist who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the 1950s. His subsequent outspoken support for human rights and opposition to the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> invasion led to his banishment to the closed city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> in 1980.

<HEAD>Authorities: Stories Of Sex On Ice May Be Fish Tales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GARRISON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stories abound that prostitutes frequently visit ice fishing houses on <LOCATION> Mille </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lacs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, where as many as 10,000 men gather on winter weekends, but authorities say they may just be fish stories. `` Personally, I've never run across the hooks, but I remember they were supposed to be working the lake back in the'60s,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a fishing guide on the large central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> lake whose shoreline includes this town. `` At least it makes a nice story. January and February can be a real boring time of year up here,'' he said. But <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbord </PERSON>, a state conservation officer who has worked the lake for nine years, said he would n't be surprised if truth is found in one of two theories: Prostitutes peddle their wares fishhouse door to fishhouse door, or they do business in their own fishhouse. `` When you check houses you run into everything under the sun,'' he said. `` You do n't know if they're girlfriends, boyfriends, wives or what. Sometimes I have to let them pull on a blanket before I come in.'' Authorities say no arrests or prosecutions on prostitution charges have been made in any of the three counties that include parts of the lake. Last fall, however, an <LOCATION> Aitkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy investigated a report that two local women were operating as prostitutes on the southeast shore, said Sheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobey </PERSON>. The report seemed credible, but there was n't enough evidence to make an arrest, he said. `` I used to always figure it was just talk,'' <PERSON> Sobey </PERSON> said. `` I've never had a fishhouse myself, so I've never had a chance to find out. He believes authorities would know if prostitutes were active in the area. `` You'd hear something. People talk,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Crow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathke </PERSON> said, `` I'd heard of it for years and I guess I've always assumed it was true because it's so logical You know, literally thousands of men in these little fish houses.'' This winter, there are nearly 4,000 fish houses on the lake, giving the frozen lake a bigger population than any of the cities on its shore. `` You've got to realize you get a real rowdy crew out there,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` There's gambling, seeing who can drink the most. Maybe that's how the stories start.'' <PERSON> Forbord </PERSON> has his own theory about the stories: `` Fishermen like to talk a pretty good brag. When you spend all weekend staring at a bobber, you start thinking about something else to do.''

<TEXT>
 A historian on the panel that investigated President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s wartime past said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could have missing records that show whether <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was involved in the executions of six British commandos. Historian <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, who is pressing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> archivists about the German army records, spoke Wednesday, a day after Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ordered a new investigation into <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s alleged connection with the executions. The commandos were captured in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> in 1944 and interrogated by the German army unit in which <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was an intelligence officer. `` We need to know who signed the interrogations and who initialed them ... The honor of this country is at stake,'' said <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> in an interview. `` This will give us that final stone in the large mosaic on which the commission labored,'' said <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, the only British member of the international commission that investigated <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. The commission's report, released last week, questioned <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s moral integrity, saying he was `` in close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities when he served as a lieutenant in the German army during World War II. The panel left open the question of whether <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> committed war crimes, but it concluded that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> tried to cover up his involvement in the war. It also found that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> knew of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s orders for the `` merciless extermination'' of captured Allied commandos. The Austrian government appointed the commission in 1986 after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> banned <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, placing him on a `` watch list'' of undesirable aliens. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing during the war. In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a session of the conservative national leadership was called today to discuss the negative impact of the historians' report. The conservative tabloid Kurier today quoted unidentified sources as saying the meeting of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders would `` reconsider'' its defense of the president. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who is not a member of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has enjoyed unqualified support from its senior oficials. But recently several prominent conservative politicians have criticized the president. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ordered the commando investigation reopened under pressure from a British legislator, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who was on <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s staff while <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general from 1972-82. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> claims the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> knew at the end World War II that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> accused <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> of being a war criminal. He also contends that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> also may have covered up facts when <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> became <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> dropped its charges against <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> but never has explained why. In the interview, <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> dealt diplomatically with questions about a possible Anglo-American cover-up of the commando incident. `` I incline to the view ... they -LRB- the interrogation records -RRB- are in the hands of some military authority or government authority over here or in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` If they do exist it would seem extraordinary that they have not come to light up to now,'' he said. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said he has had no reply to a letter he sent Jan. 23 to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, asking about the interrogation records. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, who has written again, said the silence is unusual when contrasted with prompt responses he has received previously. A raiding party of Greek partisans and seven British commandos was captured in a small boat off the German-occupied Greek island of <LOCATION> Alimina </LOCATION>. One commando divulged military secrets and survived. The rest, who refused to talk, were handed over to `` representatives'' of <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s immediate superior, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Warstorff </PERSON>, British Foreign Office records show. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said German military documents of the capture, known as the Alimina file, lack records of the second interrogation of the commandos by <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s unit, before they faced firing squads. Attached to the <PERSON> Alimina </PERSON> file was a note scrawled in English saying, `` Do not film this sheet. Interrogations reports removed because of security classification.'' Some of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> documents about the commandos have been destroyed. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the files were shredded in 1978 in routine housecleaning. A 1986 inquiry based on remaining British government records did not link <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> to the executions. But <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> pressed this week for another inquiry following the historical commission's investigations. `` The role of successive British governments must be examined,'' <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a member of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Tuesday. `` There is a consistent pattern of a cover-up.''

<HEAD>Old Age Found for Anatomically Modern Man; Find Supports African

<TEXT>
 Anatomically modern humans lived in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> 92,000 years ago, scientists said today in a study that pushes back the earliest known reliable date for the ancient humans by some 50,000 years. The finding supports the hypothesis that anatomically modern humans evolved in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> rather than independently in several places, and weighs against the idea that they descended from Neanderthals, scientists said. The study, reported by scientists from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, is `` very important for the study of the human evolution,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilbeam </PERSON>, anthrolopology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The work appears in today's issue of the British journal Nature. Researchers reported that 20 burnt flints found along with ancient human remains in the Qafzeh cave in lower <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> were about 92,000 years old, give or take 5,000 years. So the ancient humans lived there that long ago, researchers said. That means some anatomically modern humans occupied southwest <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> before Neanderthals arrived, a sharp challenge to the view that they evolved from Neanderthals, wrote <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> of the British Museum -LRB- Natural History -RRB- in an editorial accompanying the report. Neanderthals lived in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> from about 150,000 or 200,000 years ago until about 35,000 years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Pilbeam </PERSON> said the Israeli finding more than doubles `` what was previously accepted as a really good age for modern humans,'' which was 35,000 to 40,000 years. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delson </PERSON>, anthropology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said some fossils from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> suggests ages of 90,000 years and even older for modern humans, but that the evidence for those dates is not firm. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Delson </PERSON> said the new finding supports the view that modern man arose in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because it provides an early date for their living near that continent. The theory holds that more than 100,000 years ago, modern humans split into a group that stayed in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and another that went to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The humans in the Israeli cave may well have been members of early Eurasian stock, different from any living race but near the common ancestor of non-Africans, <PERSON> Delson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON>, in his editorial, said the early date for the Israeli population poses some questions, such as why modern humans took another 50,000 years to register their presence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Perhaps the environment to the north was too unsuitable, or the Neanderthals too well established, to allow a migration until all that time had elapsed, he said. Or perhaps they did migrate earlier, and their fossil remains have yet to be discovered, <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> wrote.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar drifted lower against the Japanese yen in trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Thursday, while stock prices rallied. The dollar's close matched its opening of 130.00 yen, but it was 0.41 yen lower than Wednesday's closing of 130.41. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 84.29 point-winner Wednesday, climbed 245.41 points, or 1 percent, to close at 24,675.36. A currency dealer at a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the dollar `` was drifting lower, despite no major negative news.'' The dollar's current level against the yen is within 0.2 yen of the 129.85 yen-level where it was trading early last Friday, before the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures which showed a decline in December's trade deficit. The modest rally on the stock exchange was fueled by strong interest in Japanese consumption-related issues, said an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Wako </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` What stands out particularly is strong interest in financials, such as banks and trusts, and ... stronger demand for supermarkets and department stores resulting from growing spending for consumption,'' he said. Despite the dollar's gradual slide since the release of the trade figures last Friday, Japanese blue chips were generally strong, and some traders said they believed the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> and major Japanese brokerages were cooperating to maintain share prices. Trading was thin. Volume at the end of the morning session was estimated at 350 million shares, down from 400 million shares during Wednesday's morning session.

<HEAD>Labor, FRA Disagree Over Whether Drugs, Faulty Equipment Main

<TEXT>
 Rail labor unions say the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is focusing too much attention on drug testing of train operators and too little on enforcing regulations covering faulty equipment. The federal railroad administrator countered that the criticism was `` an obvious diversionary tactic'' to shift attention from the drug-use issue. At a news conference Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a rail labor umbrella group, said the focus on drug testing and alleged drug use by rail employees has `` clouded a much deeper problem surrounding rail safety - lax, ineffective enforcement of existing rail safety laws. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the labor group's executive secretary, said that the federal railroad agency's failure to level fines against railroads for defective equipment, defective track and its failure to enforce other rail safety laws has resulted in an `` enforcement gap'' in the industry. `` Clearly the -LRB- rail -RRB- carriers have no incentive to comply with safety laws or regulations. ... There is no incentive for preventing action by the carriers to avoid hazardous conditions for employees and the public,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The issue of drug use by rail employees came to the fore last year when 16 people died in a collision near <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> between an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train and a string of three <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> diesel engines. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> pleaded guilty to manslaughter and admitted he had been smoking marijuana shortly before the accident. Tests also showed the presence of marijuana in a <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> brakeman. Last week, a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> declared the federal drug testing requirement after railroad accidents unconstititutional. The ruling, hailed by the rail unions, is being appealed by government. The labor group said that in 1986 FRA inspectors found 314,886 safety defects at the nation's railroads, but that only 6,497 resulted in safety violation reports being filed and even fewer resulted in civil penalties against the railroads. Federal railroad administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> called the statistics misleading because many of the safety defects were minor. `` We prosecuted more than 99 percent of all violations that our inspectors sent to us for prosecution,'' he said. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said that while accidents due to track, equipment, signals or hardware have declined by more than 75 percent in the past decade, the accidents involving human performance have `` climbed dramatically.'' He said virtually all the fatal accidents last year were linked to human performance. `` Those numbers speak for themselves,'' continued <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. He called the criticsm from rail labor `` an obvious diversionary tactic -LRB- and -RRB- ... an attempt to erect a fig leaf to distract attention away'' from the drug issue and attempts by his agency to get enforcement authority over rail workers. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering legislation that would allow the FRA to take action directly against a railroad employee instead of only that person's employer as now is the case. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the unions no longer oppose the FRA getting such authority, but that in return a train engineer should be able to refuse to take a train from a rail yard if he has safety concerns.

<HEAD>ATV Agreement Deadline Is Extended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government and manufacturers of all-terrain vehicles are taking about three extra weeks to work out details of an agreement settling a lawsuit over the safety of the off-road machines. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON>, general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that the court has been asked to extend the effective date of the agreement to March 7. `` Everything is moving along fine, we just needed additional time to work out technicalities,'' <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said. Announced Dec. 30, the agreement was originally scheduled to take effect after 45 days, the middle of this month. The agreement was worked out by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the makers of ATVs, principally <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kawasaki </LOCATION>. It calls for an end to sales of three-wheel ATVs, those most often blamed for the accidents which have claimed more than 900 lives and 7,000 injuries in the last five years. Manufacturers are switching to four-wheel versions of the machines. In addition the agreement would provide for free safety training for riders, improved warning labels on machines and for the makers to refrain from marketing to people aged 16 and under. Consumer groups have been critical of the settlement, contending that the three-wheeled <ORGANIZATION> ATV </ORGANIZATION>'s should have been recalled for safety reasons.

<TEXT>
 A top Pakistani official told Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> his government attaches high priority to an Afghan peace settlement that includes replacement of the existing Soviet-backed regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. In a meeting Wednesday with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said peace and stability can return to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> if a proposed Soviet troop withdrawal is accompanied by the creation of an interim government that includes `` all component parties'' in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, including rebel forces. The meeting took place against a background of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> early next week to discuss <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s plan for the withdrawal, under certain conditions, of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> starting May 15. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, minister of state for foreign affairs, said there are a `` lot of similarities'' in the Pakistani and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> positions on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But in their past statements, the two sides have indicated a difference of priorities. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has emphasized the need for an early withdrawal of Soviet forces. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has stressed the importance of an arrangement that will include both a Soviet withdrawal and the safe return of 3 million Pakistan-based Afghan refugees. This stand was reiterated Wednesday by <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> in his comments to reporters. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s insistence on the creation of a transition government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has drawn criticism from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of obstructing an end to the war. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` not averse to the idea'' of establishing an interim government. His visit is part of a flurry of diplomatic activity since Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced his plan last week for the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops. He said that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is prepared to start the pullout May 15 if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> agree to a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-sponsored </LOCATION> agreement by March 15. The withdrawal would be phased over 10 months. Afghan and Pakistani authorities are scheduled to resume their talks, through <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediators, on March 2 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` I'm confident that given a few days one way or the other, it would be possible to have an agreement and an interim government both by the middle of March or the end of March,'' <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is under heavy pressure to agree to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal A Pakistani rejection could leave it vulnerable to charges that it blocked the most promising initiative for the withdrawal of Soviet forces since they were sent to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. But an Afghan guerrilla leader, <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, said Wednesday it would be a `` historic blunder'' for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to sign an agreement to end the civil war if the present government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is not replaced.

<TEXT>
 A House-passed bill that would allow active-duty military personnel to sue the federal government for medical or dental malpractice is heading for an uncertain fate in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The measure, approved 312-61 by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, is opposed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration which says it would limit a longstanding <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> doctrine that the government is not liable for service-related injuries. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a virtually identical bill by a 317-90 vote in 1985, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> never acted on the measure. The non-partisan <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates that the bill would cost the government about $ 25 million a year if it passes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The government paid about $ 50 million in malpractice settlements in fiscal 1986 to military dependents and retirees. The latest bill, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after voice votes approving a $ 300,000 ceiling on government liability and rejecting a proposal to make the bill's provisions retroactive to Jan. 1, The House bill would cover deaths or injuries resulting from malpractice at permanent military hospitals, but would exclude treatment at field hospitals or hospital ships and claims arising from combat. The measure also would prohibit claims for mental or emotional disabilities unless they resulted from a physical injury, and would bar lawsuits for damage to a military person's status or duty assignment as a result of negligent faulty diagnosis or malpractice. Although active-duty servicemen represent about one-third of those treated at military hospitals, they are the only patients who can not sue the government for medical malpractice. The federal government generally is immune from being sued unless it gives its consent. Under a 1946 law, the government can be sued for acts of negligence by its employees while on official duty, but the same law protects the government from legal claims stemming from wartime combat operations. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1950 that the law bars active-duty military personnel _ but not their dependents or military retirees _ from suing the federal government for damages arising from government action or inaction.

<HEAD>More Automobiles Adding Rear-Seat Shoulder Belts, DOT Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Chevy Nova or Chrysler Colt hatchback need not take a back seat to the <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> or <LOCATION> Maserati </LOCATION> when it comes to protecting passengers in that part of the automobile, the government says. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday these cars are among the rapidly increasing number of vehicles with rear-seat shoulder harnesses as standard equipment beginning with the 1988 model year. Within two years virtually all cars will have the improved safety belts, the department said. The Department, under criticism from some auto safety advocates for not requiring shoulder harnesses for rear-seat passengers, released a survey Wednesday of manufacturers showing their plans for installing the equipment. The push to make shoulder belts available in the rear gained widespread attention last year after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> suggested that in some accidents lap-only belts may harm rear-seat occupants. Momentum was added by a series of successful lawsuits. The department said a proposed regulation to require rear-seat harnesses in all cars is still under review. Twenty-four of the 29 manufacturers listed reported that they had the rear-seat shoulder belts in all or some of their cars this model year. The exceptions were the Ferrari, <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON>, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> automobiles. <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> provides them as an option on 1988 models. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported it has the rear-seat shoulder belts as standard equipment on 12 car models this year ranging from the compact Chevrolet Nova to three types of Cadillac models. It will put them in all domestic cars next model year, according to <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Noack </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has the belts in its <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Merkur </PERSON> and Taurus @ Sable cars this year, will have it in nearly half its cars in the 1989 model year, said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Leavell </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plans to have the shoulder belts in all its cars by the 1990 model year, but has them only in the Colt Vista, Colt hatchback and Eagle Medallion this year. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> has the rear-seat harnesses in its <PERSON> Cressida </PERSON> and Camry this year, but offers them as an option in other models. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> has them only in its Maxima this year, but plans them in all models by 1990; <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> has them in all <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> and Acura cars; and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> has them in the 323, 626, MX-6 and 929 models, according to the department. The rear-seat harnesses also are available this model year in the <ORGANIZATION> Volkwagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Jetta </LOCATION>, Quantum, and four-door Fox; <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galant </ORGANIZATION> and Sigma; and all models of the <PERSON> Alfa </PERSON> <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Aston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, four-seat <PERSON> Maserati </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION>, Sterling and <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars that have the harnesses this year are the <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeSabre </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eldorado </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brougham </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Nova </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 88 and Toronado; and the Pontaic LeMans and <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION>, the department said.

<HEAD>DEA Official Says Cocaine To Panamanian Police Was Properly Used</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Drug Enforcement Administration says 52 pounds of cocaine taken by police working for <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> was destroyed using proper police procedures. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON>, assistant administrator for operations at <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, defended the arrangement under which the special Panamanian police narcotics force took a portion of 752 pounds of cocaine flown from <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by way of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as part of an undercover investigation. The relationship of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents and Panamanian authorities is under criticism in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s indictment by grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on charges of drug trafficking and racketeering. `` It's our understanding and belief that the cocaine left with the Panamanians was appropriately disposed of,'' <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON> said Wednesday in an interview. `` My understanding is that it subsequently was destroyed in a regular destruction exercise they had there.'' After the Panamanians received the 52 pounds in April 1986, the remainder was reloaded onto a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> plane and flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was used as evidence in a federal trial that year in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where 10 people were convicted, including reputed Bolivian cocaine dealer <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> has since said that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> set him up as a favor to Colombian cocaine lords who wanted him out of their way. The cocaine left in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was to have been used in a potential prosecution in that country which did n't materialize, said <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON>. `` We do utilize a reverse undercover technique where agents are sellers rather than purchasers,'' said <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON>. The 52 pounds of cocaine `` was retained in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for that purpose.'' Under such operations, drug enforcement agents offer drugs to suspected dealers, then confiscate the dealers' cash after making arrests. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> official said `` it's not unusual'' for countries involved as transit points in the `` controlled movement'' of narcotics to retain portions of the narcotics for use in investigations. During the trial in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Telles </PERSON> testified under questioning from defense attorney <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Apgar </PERSON> that the agency arranged for the cocaine to be flown from <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Telles </PERSON> disputed the notion that the cocaine was a payment for the Panamanians' assistance in rounding up <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> and another man convicted in the <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tang-Fortaleche </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Committee Clears Bill Requiring Businesses To Offer Medical Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pioneering health insurance bill requiring most businesses to offer medical plans survived what its sponsor called `` a long, tortuous journey'' to committee approval, with more rough traveling in store. The `` minimum health'' bill, approved 10-6 Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, would require coverage for up to 23 million of an estimated 38 million workers and dependents now going without it. `` This has been a long, tortuous journey,'' committee chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said at the start of the meeting <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said after the vote that he detected `` a very positive attitude,'' but there were signs that the bill would continue on a rocky path. It heads to the floor facing deep-seated opposition from the business community, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and conservative lawmakers. And some prospective supporters were withholding favor until their specific problems with the bill could be resolved. Under the bill, employers would have to offer a minimum package including hospital care, doctor care, diagnostic and screening tests, pre-natal and well-baby care and limited mental health treatment. The policies would cap out-of-pocket catastrophic costs at $ 3,000. Coverage would have to be offered to employees working 17.5 hours a week or more, and their dependents. Citizen Action, a community group operating in two dozen states, called the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> measure `` desperately needed'' as more people are forced to accept jobs without health benefits and other workers find their benefits eroding. In an attempt to accommodate employers, the bill temporarily exempts small family farms and permits new firms to phase in coverage over two years. Businesses of five or fewer people would have five years to phase in benefits. Special regional pools would reduce costs to small businesses. But critics were not mollified. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> denounced the bill in a statement as `` a cruel hoax'' destined to disappoint those it professes to help. `` All the committee did was pay lip service to the problem without putting forward a workable or affordable solution,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, the group's manager of health care policy. Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, R-Conn., a co-sponsor of the bill, said insurance companies and small business groups helped draft it, and he charged that they had acted in bad faith `` When it was all over, they said ` thanks a lot for letting us be part of the process, and we're against it,''' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates new coverage under the Kennedy bill would cost $ 27 billion, with $ 12 billion of that offset by reductions in administrative costs, charity care and other outlays. <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> also says about 100,000 jobs could be lost but could be offset by growth in the health sector. The cost and scope of the bill, as well as the potential for layoffs and job losses, were criticized by <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> and conservative lawmakers. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, called it a $ 30 billion solution to an $ 8 billion problem and likened it to `` using a sledge hammer to crack an egg.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, in a letter Tuesday to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, said the bill would `` impose an unduly intrusive and centralist solution.'' He recommended sharply focused state action instead.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> plans this year to shorten by half a budget process that in 1987 took an entire year to play out. But while there's a better chance than usual for speedy action, pitfalls remain. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders pledged last year that deadlines would be met. But the fiscal 1988 budget bills were n't finished until nearly Christmas, three months into the fiscal year. This year, there's cause for optimism because of the deficit reduction agreement reached last November between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders. The agreement functions as a budget over the budget. Although it lacks the legal force of legislation, both the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the Democratic leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say they'll obey its overall targets for military, domestic programs, and foreign aid. `` I believe that the spirit of bipartisan cooperation between the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration will carry over from last year's budget summit to this year's budget process,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees have scheduled hearings beginning today on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposals, followed by meetings next month to draft budget proposals of their own. Even though <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget was received nearly six weeks late _ due to last year's extended stalemate _ <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders say <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should meet its April 15 deadline for adopting a budget resolution. The resolution then serves as a guideline for fiscal legislation, mostly in the form of appropriations bills. The process calls for 13 separate bills covering virtually all government operations for the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. But in the past two years, none have been enacted separately. Instead, the president has been sent humongous catchall spending packages. He vowed in his State of the Union address never to sign another. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, has announced that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will try to send all 13 bills to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by the end of May. With a promise of speedy consideration in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the speaker said completion of the task before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' extended Labor Day recess was the target. That would nearly meet the official deadline of July 30, at least close enough for congressional work. The on-time scenario, however, depends on all sorts of things going right _ not all under <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' control. The deficit-reduction agreement is based on White House estimates which could turn sour if the economy falters. Simply obeying the agreement might not bring the fiscal 1989 deficit down to the levels prescribed by the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law. In August, the president's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> is required to assess whether legislation has been enacted to bring the deficit down to within $ 10 billion of the $ 136 billion target for fiscal 1989. If not, additional legislation would be required to bring things into line _ or across-the-board spending cuts take effect. Neither of those options would be very attractive in an election year, and a renewed struggle could ensue. And while the pact between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sets overall targets, cutting up the limited-size pies in both domestic and military accounts could prove difficult. Even before the budget arrived, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats were attacking administration assertions that more cost-cutting was needed in the Medicare program. `` It is much easier to agree to them in the abstract'' than to agree on the details, says Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

Share prices were higher almost across the board in heavy trading. Volume totaled 750 million shares. `` The overall environment of the market is becoming favorable,'' <PERSON> Ogawa </PERSON> said, adding that influential big-name stocks, including steels and shipbuildings, were gaining strength. Securities issues scored strong gains, while distribution-related shares and construction stocks also rose. On the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 130.00 yen, unchanged from its opening but down 0.41 yen from Wednesday's close of 130.41.

 Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, temporarily putting aside the Super Tuesday primaries of the South less than three weeks away, says he is hoping to pick up a victory sooner in the smaller-delegate states of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. After stressing opposition to higher taxes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> for the past week, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> returned Wednesday to the familiar theme of attacking what he said were unfair trade practices by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other countries as he campaigned in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. `` They take our technology and make a like product, and bring it to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and put our workers out of work,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said after touring an electronics assembly plant in <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, S.D. `` This administration has been asleep at the switch on trade,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> flew on to Casper for an evening rally with <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> supporters before flying back to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, which he will have visited on six of the seven days leading up to next Tuesday's primary in that state While his chief rivals were fanning out across the South in advance of the pivotal March 8 primaries throughout the region, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was gambling that he could score a win in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> next week and on March 5 in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s caucuses that would send him into Super Tuesday with the aura of a recent winner. `` I think I can do well here,'' said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who won <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses 10 days ago and finished a distant second in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampire </LOCATION>'s lead-off `` In order to do that, I have to get my message across and see people.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> strategists said they decided not to compete in three other states holding contests during the next three weeks - <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> figures to be strong, and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> are contesting. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has purchased $ 40,000 worth of television commercials in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, a significant amount in the state of just 700,000 people. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are already on the air here. Moreover, a victory in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> would be just for show. It's primary is a `` beauty contest'' in which voters will state a preference but no delegates will be awarded with the votes <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s strategists contend they can campaign in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and still attract attention in the process in the Southern states, where huge numbers of delegates are at stake. More than one-third of the Democratic nominating delegates are up for grabs on that day, with primaries in 20 states including every state of the South save <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was joining the other Democratic candidates in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for their debate this evening, and also planned trips into <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> while returning to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> nearly every day for a week and to <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> three days. At the Rapid City plant of <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactuers satellite receivers for home television viewing, president <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> the company had been forced to lay off nearly its entire work force of 150 people and seen its gross revenues decline from $ 4.5 million to less than $ 1 million in three years. He accused Japanese competitors of stealing patented technology and dumping their products at a loss to gain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales. With TV cameras rolling, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> toured the factory to underscore his call for tough trade sanctions against unfair foreign competitors and he pointed to the company as an example of imports coming into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> markets are largely closed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> acknowledged, however, that the company's troubles were also due in part to a decline in the home satellite TV business because some major satellite broadcasters have scrambled their signals to prevent home viewers from watching without paying. Founder <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> he supports the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman's trade sanctions legislation and said his company might fail `` unless you pass your trade bill and we can have a 200 percent duty put on.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Republicans scheduled caucuses and a presidential straw poll this evening, with mainstream <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders wondering how many <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters will turn out. The non-binding straw poll is first of its kind for the state's Republicans and the first in the West this election year Republican State Chairwoman <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitkus-McKinney </PERSON> said she would n't predict a winner in the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> polling, adding that backers of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> all had been working hard to get supporters of their candidates to the caucuses. Ms. <PERSON> Vitkus-McKinney </PERSON> said she has heard reports that backers of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a former television evangelist, would try to pack the caucuses, expected to draw several thousand of about 123,000 Republicans registered to vote in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Organizing drives by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> backers have proven highly successful in several states. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> finished a surprisingly strong second in last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, and his supporters in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> nearly doubled the ranks of registered Republicans in advance of a straw poll in the state. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wark </PERSON>, state coordinator for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, denied his group was involved in any caucus-packing, adding that his coordinating efforts were no different than those of coordinators for other candidates. `` We're probably the only campaign that is n't packing,'' added <PERSON> Wark </PERSON>. `` The others are. That's their strategy.'' National GOP Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> lawyer, downplayed the significance of the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> presidential straw polling, saying he did n't think it would indicate presidential preferences of Republicans in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. `` It focuses all the attention on who cranks out the most people and who gets the most people to the caucuses, which really may not be representative of the entire <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of any particular state,'' said <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> also said the winner of the straw poll `` will be trumpeting it.'' He said the top vote-getters can use the results in their money-raising efforts and to generate more support for their races in advance of the March 8 `` Super Tuesday'' primary balloting around the nation. Ms. <PERSON> Vitkus-McKinney </PERSON>, who pushed for the straw poll, said the polling has `` brought a lot of excitement to politics here in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'' and will bring out four or five times the number of people who usually attend <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses. The straw poll was developed last summer, before former <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> announced in September that he would n't seek the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. He would have been the probable <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> poll winner had he stayed in the running, Ms. <PERSON> Vitkus-McKinney </PERSON> said. She also said the straw poll results will reflect views of Republicans in many states in the West, adding, `` We normally vote for the person and we are a conservative state. The results will be used by the winner for momentum going into Super Tuesday.'' The chairwoman also said steps are being taken to guard against any caucus participation by people who are n't properly registered. She said anyone who votes illegally could be subject to later prosecution. `` This is our first go at this, so we're trying to cover any loopholes,'' she said. `` If they lie, it's a gross misdemeanor.''

<DATELINE>BAL HARBOUR, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's labor leaders are making like a duck this year in presidential politics _ calm on the surface and paddling furiously underneath to position themselves appropriately with whomever emerges as the Democratic nominee. Delegate slates in the eight states whose filing deadlines have expired show Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Micahel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> all sharing close to an equal number of union political activists wanting to get to the Democratic National Convention on their tickets. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is a close fourth, outpacing Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in all eight states, including <LOCATION> Alablama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, which border on <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s home turf of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, winding up the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s annual winter meeting today, said the 14.3-million-member labor federation is no closer now to making a presidential endorsement than it was a year ago when all of the Democratic candidates but <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were here appealing for union support. `` The essential criteria is the same, at least a two-thirds consensus,'' he said. `` But I'm not going to force it, and I'm not going to invent it.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s third largest with 1 million members, doubts there will be an endorsement. `` We ca n't change the fact that no individual has emerged as a favorite,'' he said. `` Our <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> locals got together and endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but it was n't a very strong endorsement. I would bet that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got a lot of <ORGANIZATION> UFCW </ORGANIZATION> votes in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s early endorsement of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984 helped save his campaign after he lost the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary that year to then Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. But it also enabled <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s opponents to tag labor as a `` special interest'' and created a backlash among many union members Exit polls showed only betwen 53 and 57 percent of voters from union households pulling the lever for <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in the general election _ far short of the two-thirds majority support that the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> claimed that its endorsement represented. Union leaders here are intent on avoiding a repeat of that. `` We're damned if we do and damned if we do n't,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and head of a coalition of 15 rail unions. A top <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> political official also doubts that the federation will make an endorsement before the Democratic Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July. While the federation's policy this time of encouraging union members to become convention delegates for any candidate of their choice is bringing more rank-and-file workers into the process, it also is yielding labor fewer delegates, he said. Individual union political chiefs speculate they will eventually get a total of between 10 and 15 of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s 52 convention seats based on how well labor delegate candidates fared in last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses But one federation official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said not a single labor representative won a seat in Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. `` <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION> is playing it just right, both in'84 and'88,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, a veteran political consultant who is not working for any of the presidential candidates this year. `` The idea of <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Meany </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Kirkland </ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor -RRB- was to prevent somebody unacceptable from getting the nomination. All of these guys are acceptable.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the winner of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary, set the stage for a debate with his rivals tonight by talking tough on military policy and promising a hard line on terrorism. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> traveled south Wednesday, touting positions aimed at satisfying more conservative voters. And he tossed a few pointed barbs at <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who has staked his entire campaign on doing well in the South. The governor was to spend part of today back at the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and travel to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for a faceoff with the other Democrats. Facing the inevitable question about whether he is too liberal, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a news conference, `` I do n't understand these labels. I'm a guy who's supposed to be a liberal from the Northeast. I've balanced nine budgets in a row ... I've cut taxes five times in the last four years. We've cut crime.'' In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he wanted to strengthen the nation's conventional forces and crack down on terrorism He challenged his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rivals to out-do him on `` toughness.'' `` I do n't yield on toughness to <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in any shape or manner,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Later in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fired another shot across <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s bow when told that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had accused his opponents of being alienated from the electorate. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, virtually left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know who's alienated.'' The governor's message was not entirely hard-line. In the <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION> press conference he stated flatly, `` I'm not going to cut social programs ... I, for one, am not going to balance the budget on the backs of poor people.'' He also said he would keep the defense budget at about its current funding. To cut the federal deficit he said, as he has throughout the campaign, that he would institute an aggressive tax collection program. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is of critical importance to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said it may offer his best opportunity to win one of the southern states on Super Tuesday. Speaking to about 600 cheering supporters in this Gulf coast community, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` If, three weeks from now, with your help, we can do well in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, we're going to be on our way to the White House.'' The idea that the South is politically different from the rest of the nation is false, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` There's a mythology about the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> as if it's some kind of foreign country. It's nonsense,'' he said. Campaign aides say <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will focus his economic opportunity message on states with the most electoral votes. And he will drive home his points with the biggest campaign war chest of any of the Democratic candidates. Former <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Dutch </PERSON> <PERSON> Morial </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in his <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> appearance. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> are states where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is expected to do well on March 8. Others, like <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, wo n't come to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fold as easily as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, his aides acknowledge Boston-based political consultant <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign sources tell him the governor will spend between $ 3 million and $ 4 million in the South.

<HEAD>Kohl To Voice Concerns About Short-Range Nuclear Arsenal</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tops prospects uncertain.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 West German concerns about plans to modernize <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range nuclear arsenal were being conveyed to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and congressional leaders today by visiting Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. The importance of the weapons with ranges below 315 miles has loomed larger in recent months in planning by the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for its defenses once intermediate-range nuclear forces are eliminated under a treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Short-range missiles are of particular concern to the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government because <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would be the battleground if they are used. The West German government says the upgrading of short-range missiles should be linked to an overall reduction in the number of the weapons and to progress in efforts to reduce the Soviet superiority in conventional weapons in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The West Germans say <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> first must develop an overall arms strategy and iron out differences within the alliance before embarking on missile modernization programs. `` -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- sees no need for an isolated decision on modernizing or not modernizing particular nuclear weapon systems at this point,'' <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON>, chief government spokesman, said this week. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> arrived Wednesday and planned to meet with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said before <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s arrival that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had gone along with the modernization decision when it was made in 1983 and reaffirmed that support two months ago, and that the Soviets benefited from the new concerns. `` No alliance allows its forces to defend itself ... with weapons from yesteryear,'' said <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> affairs. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: `` It is unfortunate ... the Soviets have managed somehow to jump right into the middle of all this and to suggest that there is somehow disarray in the alliance, a crisis in the alliance on the question of modernization.'' The chancellor also is expected to renew calls for quick <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification of the U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles _ those that have a range of 315 to 3,000 miles The accord, which calls for reductions in the next three years, was signed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December. West German officials said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also is likely to press for a worldwide ban on chemical weapons. In a related development, government spokesman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> denied news reports that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> would travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this fall.

<HEAD>Meese Makes Seventh Appearance Before Iran-Contra Grand Jury</HEAD>

 A grand jury investigating the Iran-Contra affair again heard testimony from Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> after appearances in recent weeks from other members of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s staff <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s appearance Wednesday before the grand jury was his seventh. The panel is believed to be focusing on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s Nov. 22-23, 1986, investigation that uncovered the diversion of arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. The attorney general has refused to comment on his grand jury appearances, but the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says he is cooperating with the investigation being conducted by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and is not a target. The grand jury recently heard testimony by Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who found a memo revealing the diversion in <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> files, and Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, another member of the team. Former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who was present when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to conduct the investigation and when the attorney general reported his findings, has also testified recently. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s investigation was criticized by congressional committees that held hearings last summer on the Iran-Contra affair. The panels faulted <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for not recruiting <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers with more experience investigating criminal cases and for failing to take notes during interviews with top administration officials after he learned about the diversion. The congressional committees said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s failure to secure <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> files allowed documents to be shredded by then-national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide Lt.

<HEAD>Screening For AIDS Common Among Health Insurers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Insurance companies have reported that many AIDS-related claims were based on physical conditions that existed before the policies went into effect and therefore should be restricted or denied, a survey says. The report released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> also determined that screening of health insurance applicants to detect the AIDS virus is common among insurance companies and health maintenance organizations. The OTA report said that while the number of AIDS cases reported by various companies ranged up to 3,000, most insurers had reimbursed no more than 10 AIDS-related cases. Twelve commercial insurers and three <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> plans reported that 10 percent or more of their AIDS-related cases were linked with a `` pre-existing condition'' for AIDS. Two of the 12 commercial insurers reported that more than half their AIDS-related claims were based on pre-existing conditions. Almost half the commercial insurers surveyed _ 21 out of 44 _ reported no pre-existing AIDS-related cases among their AIDS claims. Forty-five of the 61 companies surveyed reported having AIDS claims. A pre-existing condition is one that exists before an insurance policy goes into effect and which would cause an ordinarily prudent person to seek diagnosis, care or treatment. The issue is being thrashed out in the courts, the study said. `` At present, there are several court cases pending relating to what comprises a pre-existing condition for AIDS and the alleged refusal by insurer -LRB- s -RRB- to pay for AIDS-related claims based on a policy's pre-existing condition provision,'' it said. <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said its survey of commercial insurers, <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> plans and HMOs found that most insurers ask AIDS-related questions on applications and require health histories from an applicant's physician. The report said 51, or 86 percent, of the 62 commercial insurers who responded to the survey either screen or plan to screen individual applicants for infection with the AIDS-causing HIV virus. Forty-one already do and another 10 plan to start the tests. Eleven of 15 <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> plans surveyed either screen or plan to screen, as do eight of 16 responding HMOs.

The survey found that there is a difference, however, in how insurers judge someone to be at risk of AIDS as opposed to being at risk of contracting other diseases. In addition to evaluating medical criteria, 18 of the 62 commercial insurers said they consider sexual orientation in determining risk of contracting AIDS, as did four of the 16 HMOs surveyed. As of Jan. 25, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 51,916 Americans, of whom more than half, or 28,965, have died since 1979, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

 Foreigners seeking to remain in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for more than six months will be required to obtain medical certificates showing they are free of the AIDS virus, the immigration commissioner said. The new regulation, which takes effect April 18, will also apply to the 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> civilians and military dependents stationed here, Commissioner <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Defensor-Santiago </PERSON> said on Wednesday. Foreigners who plan to remain less than six months need not produce an AIDS-free certificate but must do so if they extend their visas. Fewer than 100 carriers of the fatal disease have been identified in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Most are women who work in bars and nightclubs located near the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and the Subic Bay naval base. Mrs. <PERSON> Defensor-Santiago </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> authorities would work out guidelines for implementation of the order for American military personnel. Last year, health officials complained that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities were slow in responding to requests for information on AIDS screening of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. Health officials had asked for guarantees that troops found with the virus would not be posted to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child at or before birth.

<TEXT>
 A Socialist and a saxophonist are among the dozens of Arizonans _ 77 at last count _ lining up for the chance to run against Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in a May 17 recall election. Only two, Democrat <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minority leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, a Republican, are given any real chance by political observers of unseating the impeached <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governor. But some of the lesser-knowns still insist their candidacies are worthwhile. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Colosimo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, a former teacher and a saxophone player in local bands, said he is working full-time on the race. `` If I did n't think I could win I would n't run,'' <PERSON> Colosimo </PERSON> said. `` If I can run a household with five children and a wife, then I think I'd be pretty able to balance the books when I got into the office.'' However, <PERSON> Colosimo </PERSON> acknowledged his candidacy so far is a `` one-man show.'' He has never sought public office before but said, `` I was president of my senior class _ that's a joke.'' Meanwhile, the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday granted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> a one-week delay of his impeachment trial originally set to begin Monday, but defeated two motions for further delay offered by the embattled governor's attorney, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s request that the trial be put off until criminal charges accusing <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan are tried. The lawyer had contended that an impeachment trial would prejudice the criminal trial jury. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who will preside at the impeachment trial, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a one-week delay would ultimately save time by allowing some issues to be settled beforehand. If <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is convicted in his impeachment trial, lawmakers could vote to bar him from holding any future political office. At this point, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> will automatically be placed on the recall ballot. All other would-be candidates in the winner-take-all vote must file at least 3,336 valid petition signatures of registered voters by March 18. The secretary of state's office said 77 people had picked up packets to collect petition signatures by Wednesday. Wednesday was the first day for candidates to file petition signatures, but none did. Among the earliest to pick up packets were Mrs. <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, the former state schools superintendent who lost to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in a three-way race in November 1986, and <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, who has said he will announce Friday whether he will run. Other potential candidates range from Republican national committeeman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Londen </PERSON>, who said he was considering running `` to preserve the conservative alternative'' if <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is barred from running, to <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Senter </PERSON>, a meatpacker who ran for mayor of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> last fall as the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate. <PERSON> Senter </PERSON> conceded that he ca n't win but said he also wants to provide voters with an alternative. `` I'm against everything that he -LRB- <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> -RRB- stands for,'' <PERSON> Senter </PERSON> said, citing the governor's cancellation of a state holiday celebrating <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s birthday. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who also has been criticized for making remarks that have angered blacks, homosexuals, Jews, women and the Japanese, did not return telephone calls seeking comment on the number of potential candidates. Democratic Secretary of State Rose Mofford, who is acting governor pending <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial, has no plans to run in the recall election, said her spokeswoman, <PERSON> Athia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardt </PERSON>. If she does, state law will probably force her to resign. Further complicating matters, Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> has issued an opinion saying that if <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is removed from office before the recall vote, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, as the new governor, would have to face the recall herself. `` It's all messed up, it really is,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hardt </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is considering a bill that would cancel the recall election if <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> resigns or is removed before the ballot is printed.

<HEAD>Inmates Take Over 12 Dormitories at Rikers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An estimated 550 inmates used beds and other furniture to barricade themselves inside a dozen jail dormitories on <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> early Thursday in an apparent protest over searches, authorities said. Early reports indicated that no hostages were taken and no injuries were reported, said city correction department spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON>. The inmates took over the dormitories at the <ORGANIZATION> Anna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the city's maximum-security jail, around midnight Wednesday, Ms. <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON> said. The center houses mainly convicted felons awaiting transfers to state jails, as well as some prisoners awaiting trial. The inmates `` barricaded doors and entrances and exits so they are not allowing'' correction officers in, she said. Negotiators with the mutual assistance team, `` a team of officers trained to handle disturbances of this sort,'' made contact with the prisoners around 2 a.m., and extra guards were deployed at the facility, Ms. <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON> said. `` The security staff is apparently talking with the inmates in an attempt to resolve the disturbance peacefully,'' she said. `` They are also trying to determine what their complaints and their problems are.'' Although it was not immediately known what sparked the uprising, inmates had strongly protested searches conducted by guards Wednesday, Ms. <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON> said. Inmates at the center, which houses 2,400 inmates in all, are kept in dormitories _ large rooms filled with beds _ rather than cells, she said. A head count was conducted. The city's prison system is currently at slightly more than 100 percent of capacity with more than 15,000 prisoners _ more than 11,000 at <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON> said. The inmates had been calling news organizations to say that they had taken over the entire facility, Ms. <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON> said, but the claim was not true.

 Explorer <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> has returned to <LOCATION> Easter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> an ancient carved stone torso he took away to his native <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> 30 years ago, a local press report said. <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> and the 530-pound object arrived by plane this week at the tiny island, a territory of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> 2,230 miles west of the mainland, according Wednesday's editions of the <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> daily <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercurio </PERSON>. <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON>, 74, was greeted by the island's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> who, wearing body paint and tribal clothing, unloaded the 5-foot-tall carving and blessed it at the airport. The somber ceremony quickly gave way to `` a happy street party,'' the newspaper said. The explorer and anthropologist sailed in replicas of primitive crafts across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> -LRB- 1947 -RRB-, the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> -LRB- 1970 -RRB- and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> -LRB- 1977 -RRB- to seek evidence that ancient cultures could have been diffused by transoceanic travelers. He described these voyages in books called `` <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiki </PERSON>,'' `` The Ra Expeditions'' and `` The Tigris Expedition.'' <LOCATION> Easter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is home to nearly 400 massive, brooding stone figures carved several hundred years ago and called moais. The moai returned by <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> is unique, in that it represents the body of a woman. All others were made to resemble men. <PERSON> Heyerdahl </PERSON> discovered the torso in 1958, bought it for an unspecified price and carried it off for display in his <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiki </PERSON> museum in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the report said. It said he decided to return it when the moai's head was found about a year ago in the crater of an extinct volcano, <PERSON> Rano </PERSON> <PERSON> Kau </PERSON>. The head and torso will be reunited and put on display at the island's own museum, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercurio </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> won a one-week delay in his impeachment trial, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected his effort to have it postponed until after he faces criminal charges of concealing a campaign loan. The governor's attorney, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, would not say after the votes Wednesday whether he would follow through on an earlier threat to take the issue to court if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did not grant a delay. `` We will do whatever we think is appropriate to protect all the governor's rights,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s motion to delay the trial until 20 days after the resolution of the criminal case lost on a voice vote, and a motion to delay the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proceeding a flat 90 days went down 24-5, with five Republicans supporting the governor. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was impeached Feb. 5 for allegedly concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership and trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official. In addition, at least 77 people are considering challenging <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in a recall election May 17, including a former congressman and a former state school superintendent beaten by the Republican in a three-way race in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agreed to delay the start of its trial from Monday to Feb. 29 after state Chief Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> advised that a one-week postponement would actually save time because both sides could settle some issues beforehand. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> is the presiding officer in the impeachment trial. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> has contended that holding the impeachment trial before the end of the criminal trial, which is scheduled to begin March 9, would prejudice the criminal trial jury and harm the governor's right to a fair decision But <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON>, a Republican, warned, `` There is an ongoing fear ... that this will be the beginning of lots of motions for continuations'' by <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Senators also refused to drop or revise a rule adopted last week that allows the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to hold closed meetings during the impeachment trial. Lawmakers said last week the meetings could be held to consult with lawyers, discuss what questions could be asked or which witnesses to call and make final deliberations on whether to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. The idea of closed meetings was sharply criticized by the media, and 11 senators boycotted a brief closed meeting held during Tuesday's session. Sen. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON>, a Republican, said that keeping the closed meetings could be `` feeding the worst suspicions of those in the public who are distrustful of our motives.''

 Cease-fire talks between the Nicaraguan government and the Contra rebels will not succeed until the Sandinistas make more democratic reforms at home, a Contra delegate to the negotiations said. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON> and six other Contra delegates arrived in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for talks today aimed at achieving a cease-fire in the six-year war between the rebels and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. In another development, the foreign ministers of five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries met Wednesday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, to discuss a way to verify compliance with a regional peace plan. The ministers _ from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> _ did not come up with a verification plan but agreed to meet again by March 15 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Regarding the truce negotiations, the Contra delegates said in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Wednesday they still want to expand the talks to include representatives of the internal Nicaraguan opposition and to cover political issues. `` Our position has not changed, and it will not change,'' <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON> said. `` There can be no cease-fire unless the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> first agree to democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s government has insisted on limiting the discussions with the U.S.-supported Contras to the mechanics of working out a 30-day truce that could lead to a permanent cease-fire. The Sandinistas say they will talk about political changes in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> only after the Contras have accepted an amnesty, laid down their arms and resumed civilian life within the country. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, the Nicaraguan deputy foreign minister, is heading the <LOCATION> Sandinista </LOCATION> delegation to the peace talks, scheduled to end Saturday. <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> <PERSON> Carazo </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> banker, leads the Contra group. Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, is mediator. The first direct talks between the warring sides were last month in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, a week before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> voted down President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for $ 36.2 million in Contra aid. Negotiators for the rebels and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> offered sharply contrasting proposals at the two-day session in January, which was noted both for its cordiality and lack of progress. Diplomatic observers suggested neither side wanted to rock the boat before the congressional vote. At that session, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> offered a slightly revised version of a negotiating position first outlined by President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last Nov. 13. It called for a truce from March 15 to April 15. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said at the time that the army would halt offensive operations on March 1 to give the Contras time to move into three cease-fire zones in the northern, central and southern parts of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Once inside the zones, the Contras would be permitted to retain their weapons and receive food, medicine, clothing and other humanitarian supplies from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> or any other recognized international relief agency. At the end of the truce period, the Contras would be expected to hand over their arms to an international commission, accept amnesty and return to civilian life with full constitutional guarantees. The Contras have asked the government to agree to 17 changes in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s constitution, including a prohibition on presidential succession, electoral reforms, limits on presidential power, and separation of the army from the governing Sandinista party. The talks are being held in accordance with a <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace plan signed last August by the five countries whose foreign ministers met in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. At the meeting, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> told reporters the officials must discuss certain issues in more detail and at greater length. In a joint statement, the ministers said they would seek help in verifying compliance with the regional peace plan from other countries and organizations `` of recognized impartiality and technical capability that have shown their desire to cooperate with the Central American peace process.'' The foreign ministers form the peace plan's verification panel. The presidents of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries decided last month to dissolve an earlier, more extensive commission in favor of the panel of foreign ministers. The peace plan calls for cease-fire talks between the governments and rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as a first step toward democratic elections. It also urges political amnesties and a ban on all outside military assistance to rebel groups.

 The main opposition party urged Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to dismantle some nuclear missiles before the new U.S.-Soviet arms treaty is ratified, as the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has done. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported that Soviet SS-12 missiles in Waren, an East German site northwest of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, were dismantled, put in crates and were ready for transport back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The SS-12s are part of the U.S.-Soviet agreement last December to eliminate medium-range and shorter-range missiles within three years. The treaty applies to nuclear missiles with a range of 300 to 3,000 miles. <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>, disarmament expert for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government should respond to the Soviet move with the early scrapping of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 72 Pershing 1A missiles. `` Such a reaction would be equal to developing trust in disarmament which the leadership in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has been working toward with the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON> said, speaking on behalf of the party. East German newspapers praised Soviet plans for early removal of the SS-12 missiles from <PERSON> Waren </PERSON>. `` Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the DDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-. Troops in Waren dismantle medium-range rockets earlier than expected,'' the Communist party's official newspaper, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said in banner headlines Wednesday. ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when they would be returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, only that Soviet soldiers `` are making the last preparations to return their SS-12 rockets.'' `` With this step we can make an important contribution toward disarmament even before the treaty between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is ratified,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. The East Berlin-based newspaper <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON> said Wednesday: `` Removal of missile troops from the DDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- starts earlier than expected.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the superpower treaty in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> had announced beforehand that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would scrap its Pershing 1A missiles if a treaty was agreed upon. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> owns the Pershing 1A missiles, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> controls the nuclear warheads for the rockets. Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees are debating the treaty and ratification may come this summer. The Supreme Soviet, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s parliament, is expected to approve the accord. East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> said in January that Soviet intermediate-range rockets based in his country could be removed ahead of schedule, but at the time he gave no specific timetable. According to figures released after the treaty was signed, 22 rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practice missiles were stationed at the Waren site, which holds the largest numbers of SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. There are three other SS-12 rocket sites in the country. The city of <LOCATION> Waren </LOCATION> is 90 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.

 Two former executives of the <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutritional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> face substantial prison terms and fines after being convicted of selling flavored sugar water labeled as apple juice for babies. Former <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Neils </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> and a former vice president, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>, were charged with hundreds of violations of federal food and drug laws along with conspiracy and mail fraud. <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> was convicted Wednesday of all 448 counts in the indictment, said federal prosecutor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> was found guilty on 351 counts of violating federal food and drug laws; the jury, however, could not reach a verdict on about 80 other counts against him, including conspiracy and mail fraud, <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said. The maximum penalty for conspiracy is five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine; for mail fraud, five years and $ 1,000; and for food and drug law violations, three years and $ 10,000, <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> did not set a date for sentencing, but it should be within six to eight weeks, <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said both <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>, who were allowed to remain free on bail until sentencing, face `` substantial prison terms and substantial fines.'' It is likely, however, that they would serve concurrent sentences. Lawyers for both men declined to comment on the verdict but said they would appeal the convictions. <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> called the result of the three-month trial `` an important victory for consumers. The corporation, which also was named in the November 1986 indictments, pleaded guilty last year, a fact the judge withheld from the jury.

<HEAD>U.S. Receives Two Boxes Of MIAs Remains From Laos</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> has given <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials two boxes of remains it believes to be those of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen missing during the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said today. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the number of remains would not be known until they are analyzed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. The remains are to be flown from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> Friday, he said. The official said the Laotians on Wednesday also turned over identification cards of three men on the official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> list of 555 Americans missing in action, or MIA, in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>, the spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said it was the first time since August 1978 that <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> unilaterally had made MIA remains available to the Americans. A number of remains were retrieved when the two sides jointly excavated warplane crash sites in 1985 and 1986, however. A statement from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, said the mission's charge d'affaires, <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Isom </PERSON>, and military officials received the remains at a ceremony in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> airport. The Laotians also handed over pieces of aircraft wreckage they excavated in December and January, said the statement, which was dated Wednesday. The official Laotian radio on Wednesday said the remains were retrieved during excavations in <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> and Saravane provinces. Both are in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' southern panhandle area, between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` The Lao side's positive response to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian question shows the sincerity of the ... government in improving relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' Laotian radio said. A text of the broadcast was obtained today from a Western embassy in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' communist government agreed last August to resume efforts to account for MIAs after apparently having suspended them since a crash-site excavation in February 1986. In return, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has pledged to respond to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' calls for humanitarian assistance. Many of the MIAs in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> were airmen shot down on missions against the <ORGANIZATION> Ho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trail </ORGANIZATION>, which North Vietnamese communist forces used to ferry men and supplies to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today to scratch dozens of programs from the military wish list and for the first time in his presidency to make significant cuts in the size of American forces. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, in a lengthy annual report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> accompanying the president's fiscal 1989 budget proposal, said the administration was living up to the bargain it made with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last November setting new military spending limits. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> believes the limits will force it `` to accept greater risks than we think wise.'' `` We have done our best to apportion reductions in ways that minimize those risks. We will reduce the size of our forces, but the units we do field will have what they need to perform the tasks entrusted to them.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the combined active-duty forces of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> will be reduced gradually this year to 2,138,000 and then held at that level throughout fiscal 1989 _ which begins on Oct. 1. That will represent a cut of about 34,000 active-duty positions compared to the 2,172,000 that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized for this year, and a cut of 46,000 compared to the fiscal 1989 force the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had planned. `` Reductions will be accommodated through attrition and reduced accessions -LRB- recruiting -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> will diminish by roughly 23,000 to about 576,000. The Army will lose about 8,600 soldiers, dropping to about 772,000, while the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> will lose about 2,900 to about 197,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will hold steady at about 593,000. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary said more than 10,000 civilian jobs would be cut in fiscal 1989 _ leaving a total of 1,102,000 worldwide _ but reserve strength would hold steady at 1.17 million. The administration's priorities are unchanged, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> continued. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> wants $ 4.55 billion for the Star Wars missile defense system compared to $ 3.55 billion this year; wants to continue work on a rail-mobile version of the MX missile; is requesting $ 1.4 billion for another Trident nuclear submarine, and wants servicemen to receive a 4.3 percent pay raise instead of the 2 percent planned for civilian government workers. On the other hand, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the Army will deactivate a motorized infantry brigade at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and cancel the scheduled activation of two light infantry battalions in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will forego plans to stand up a 14th air wing at the <LOCATION> Miramar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> and retire ships it wanted to keep, and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> will deactivate two fighter wings. The fiscal 1989 budget totals for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> have been known for three months _ ever since the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reached agreement on a two-year, deficit-reduction package. Under that compromise, $ 299.5 billion will be authorized for military programs in fiscal 1989 and $ 294 billion actually spent in outlays. The difference represents authorized funding for long-term projects and weapons buying in future years. The fiscal 1989 total is an increase over the $ 291.4 billion in budget authority approved for this year but is unlikely to compensate for inflation. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> complained that fiscal 1989 will be the fourth consecutive year of `` negative real growth'' in military spending. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had asked for authority to spend $ 332.4 billion in fiscal 1989 before the deficit compromise was adopted _ meaning dozens of military programs had to be revised. According to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, the result was that:

<HEAD>Shock Wave Machine Safe and Effective for Gallstones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A powerful blast of shock waves can smash gallstones inside the body and may someday replace surgery for more than 100,000 Americans each year, experts say. The procedure, called lithotripsy, has already become the standard treatment for kidney stones. Research published today suggests it will also be useful for many people with gallstones, which are four times more common. Doctors in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> showed that the procedure is `` a safe and effective treatment in selected patients'' with gallstones. Their work is the first large-scale examination of the therapy for people with this problem. More than 150 hospitals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already have shock wave machines for smashing kidney stones. Since its approval in 1984, this therapy has become routine for many of the 120,000 Americans who once required kidney stone surgery each year. An estimated 475,000 Americans undergo gallstone surgery annually. `` Most of us think that at least 20 percent and maybe even a third to half of the -LRB- gallstone -RRB- patients in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> within three to five years could be treated by this means,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON>. `` A significant number of people who are treated with surgery could be treated without surgery.'' <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON>, a researcher at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, is among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts who plan to begin testing the shock wave machines, called lithotriptors, next spring. Lithotriptors use shock waves to smash stones still inside the body. Instead of requiring major surgery and about six weeks of recuperation, patients are sent home within a day or two and often do n't require general anesthesia. The German study was conducted by Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sackmann </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Munich </ORGANIZATION>. A report on their first 175 patients was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. `` It's the only really good study that's been done in the world, and it's very optimistic data by a very good group,'' said <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON>. As currently set up, kidney stone lithotriptors can not be used to treat gallstones. Kidney stones are made largely of calcium, and the machines are equipped with X-rays to produce images of them. But most gallstones are made of cholesterol, which does n't show up on X-rays. So gallstone lithotriptors use ultrasound to make their pictures. Lithotriptors designed to smash gallstones are being installed in 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals for experimental use. In the German study, only about a quarter of all gallstone patients were allowed to try the treatment. Many were excluded because they had more than three stones or especially large ones. The treatment pulverized their gallstones, leaving only a trace of fine sand or sludge. The patients took bile acid drugs for three months to dissolve the debris. Within a year or so, this residue was gone completely in more than 90 percent of the patients. The therapy failed to break up a stone in just one case. That patient was the only one of the 175 who required surgery. Lithotriptors like that used in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> cost $ 1.2 million or more. Gallbladder surgery typically costs between $ 6,000 and $ 7,000. <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> said that initially, patients treated with lithotripsy will be kept in the hospital for two days, and their treatment will cost $ 4,000 to $ 5,000. However, this price will probably go down as doctors gain experience and begin sending patients home a few hours after the procedure.

<DATELINE>USULUTAN, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A boom startled the sentries, shattered the tropical pre-dawn calm and cut off all the lights at the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> outside this provincial capital. The attack was part of the biggest guerrilla offensive this year. The coordinated strike included a raid on the 6th Infantry Brigade base in <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION>, 5 miles east of the cooperative, and the blowing up of two bridges and more than a dozen utility poles. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, about 60 miles to the northwest, foreign ministers of five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations met to assess progress in implementing a regional peace accord signed last August. Army officers said the attacks early Wednesday by 600 insurgents of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> left at least 18 people dead. Fourteen people were wounded. An entire family _ the five young <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> children and their parents _ perished when a guerrilla mortar fell short of the 6th Brigade compound and hit their one-room brick and adobe home in a poor neighborhood. Five soldiers of the brigade died, as did at least five guerrillas, said the brigade commander, Col. <PERSON> Inocencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON>. He said about 300 rebels took part in the strike on the base. <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> said four of the 55 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers stationed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> were at the base when the assault began at 12:10 a.m., but none was in danger. Pvt. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marinero </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> slouched on the steps of the cooperative's makeshift barracks, exhausted after many hours of combat. After the mortar barrage, he said, the guerrillas `` attacked from all sides.'' He said a mortar round scored a direct hit on one of the open-sided, zinc-roofed warehouses behind the barracks, igniting stacked bales of cottonseed. <PERSON> Marinero </PERSON> said he did not know if the other warehouses caught fire from the heat of the first blaze or if the dozens of rebels that penetrated the cooperative burned them. Seven of the 15 warehouses were destroyed. Members and officials of the cooperative did not have a dollar estimate of the damage. A cottonseed oil factory next to the cooperative also was attacked and damaged. By midday, tired firefighters with soot-streaked faces took turns training a stream of water on the only warehouse fire that still threatened to spread. Rebels fighting an 8-year-old war against the U.S.-supported government contend economic targets, especially farms or storage facilities for coffee, cotton and sugar, are valid military objectives. The three products account for 80 percent of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s foreign exchange Lt. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> <PERSON> Henriquez </PERSON>, commander of the cooperative's permanent 30-man police detachment, said the attackers numbered about 300 The guerrillas demolished a utility pole down the road from the big communal enterprise then fired 60mm mortars and rocket-propelled grenades for about 15 minutes. `` Then they attacked shouting like Indians,'' <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> said on the porch of the cooperative's offices. `` They shouted at us to surrender, calling to me by my name that it was useless to resist.''

 A car bomb exploded on a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> expressway today, wounding two people, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It also said two other `` powerful bombs'' were defused `` in the last several days'' in north <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Vanak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and a gasoline station in <LOCATION> Ormieh </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> province in northwest <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, close to the Iraqi border. The expressway bombing was the second in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> this week. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported that 10 people were wounded Tuesday when a car bomb exploded in a residential quarter in the northern part of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> That blast happened five days after Iranians celebrated the ninth anniversary of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Islamic Revolution that toppled the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> in 1979. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said today's explosion damaged cars and shattered windows of nearby stores. It gave no other details in a terse report. It blamed the bombing on `` agents of world arrogance,'' a revolutionary epithet for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its European allies. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> includes <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, with which it has been fighting since September 1980, among <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s allies. Last September, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said a car bomb exploded in a north <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> street. The agency did not mention any casualties in that blast. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official media reported last month that four people identified as terrorists were hanged in public for planting car bombs in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and the western city of <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION> last year. The reports said the four had smuggled cars from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> before packing them with explosives. Thirty-tree people were killed and more than 200 wounded in car bombings in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and the the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, 110 miles south of the capital, in August 1986. Several people were later executed. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has blamed the bombings on the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION>, the main opposition group seeking to oust the fundamentalist government. The Iraq-based <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> have repeatedly denied those charges.

 The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>' chancellor says he has `` great admiration'' for minority students who ended their six-day takeover of an academic building after they were promised remedies for campus racism Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said the negotiations were conducted cordially with representatives of the more than 150 students, who filed out of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with their fists raised in a victory salute Wednesday afternoon. `` I ordered Chinese food and I hunched over one word processor and they were at another,'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said. `` They were a very lively, interesting, wonderful group of young people. We had a good time. We also had serious differences.'' <PERSON> Segun </PERSON> <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON>, 25, a UMass senior and a member of the protest group, was one of the few students who remained in the Afro-American studies and cultural center, where the only evidence of the protest was a sign outside reading, `` Thanks for Your Support.'' `` Basically, I think this is the beginning, this is the easy part,'' said <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON>. `` I feel like we've won the first major battle.'' The five-page agreement between <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> and nine of the protesters was reached late Tuesday night following nearly four hours of negotiations. It included a promise to change the school's student conduct code to allow suspension of students who commit acts of racial violence or harassment <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> also promised extensive renovation of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and funds for educational and cultural activities for minority students. And he agreed to increased funding to recruit of minority students and teachers, but rejected a demand for student involvement in hiring faculty. No amounts of funding were negotiated. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> also consented to the formation of a student committee to monitor progress of the pact. Prior to Tuesday's negotiations, protesters dropped their demands to suspend or dismiss five white students accused of beating two blacks Feb. 7 and suspend campus police officers accused of forming a line-up of blacks the same night in a search for men who allegedly harassed a female student. The protesters said they were satisfied the university or courts would deal with the incidents properly. `` The nature of this event had to do with a group who wanted to show the world their apprehenson, concern and fear,'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> told reporters. `` I have great admiration for the students' leadership, concern and courage.'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, however, blamed the Feb. 7 incidents more on alcohol abuse than racism. The 150 students, many of whom remained in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> during the takeover, said they broke an early-morning deadlock and debated the administration's response until just before noon Wednesday. `` I feel like I'm going to faint _ I have n't been able to sleep and I have n't been able to eat,'' said <PERSON> Joella </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, 24, a junior who burst in to tears after the vigil ended. `` But it was all worth it.'' About 200 spectators, including <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, daughter of former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, watched the end of the takeover, which began Friday morning. Miss <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, 20, was among 14 people arrested in November 1986 at <ORGANIZATION> UMass </ORGANIZATION> during a protest of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> recruitment on campus. She was later acquitted of trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> discouraged a call by students for a moratorium on classes Tuesday and Wednesday to protest racism, sexism and other forms of oppression. Protesters claimed the present climate at UMass began with a clash between blacks and whites following the 1986 World Series.

 <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> denied involvement in the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner, according to testimony today at the kidnapping trial of his brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is accused of kidnapping two West Germans in January 1987 in a bid to force the West German government to reject a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition request for <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. The contents of several letters <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> wrote to relatives in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after his arrest in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last year were read into the court record today. West German federal criminal officers seized the letters before they could be smuggled out of the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> prison where <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is being held. In a letter dated Jan. 21, 1987, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> wrote to his parents: `` I found out today about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' allegations. I am being accused of something that I had nothing to do with.'' In another letter to another brother, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> wrote: `` I only ask that the kidnappers take good care of the hostages. They're just people being held like me.'' On Wednesday, federal investigator <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pruefer </PERSON> said an acquaintance of <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Hamsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassim </PERSON>, told police the defendant informed him in a telephone conversation that West German businessman <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> had been kidnapped. <PERSON> Kassim </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who was calling from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, as saying: `` We have kidnapped a West German,'' according to his statement to police. Excerpts of <PERSON> Kassim </PERSON>'s statement to police were read into the court record on Wednesday. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was kidnapped Jan. 17, 1987, shortly after <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, was arrested in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and later accused of the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking. In one excerpt read into the court record, <PERSON> Kassim </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION> state, said <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told him that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested because `` he was one of the kidnappers of the American <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'' jetliner. <PERSON> Kassim </PERSON> also told police that <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> made the remarks on Jan. 14, 1987, one day after his brother <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport carrying explosives. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is accused of kidnapping the two West Germans in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in a bid to force the West German government to reject a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to extradite his brother. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> turned down the extradition request, but has since charged him in this country. Last week, former West German hostage <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was not among the initial gunmen who kidnapped him from his <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> hotel room Jan. 20. He said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was older and taller than the men who abducted him. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> also said he did not think a man who questioned him in German in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and speaks fluent German. Federal officers have testified that <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s fingerprints were found on a letter <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> wrote to family members during his captivity. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was released in September in what his kidnappers said was a good-will gesture. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> is still being held. West German authorities last week charged <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> with murder and air piracy in connection with the 1985 hijacking of the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He faces the same charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed and 39 Americans were held for 17 days in the hijacking ordeal. A trial date for <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, 23, has not yet been set. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison. He remains in investigative custody in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. A third West German citizen, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Schray </PERSON>, was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> three weeks ago in an apparent attempt to increase pressure on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to release the <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> brothers. No one has claimed responsibility for that kidnapping.

 <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> may have the highest per-capita level of education in the nation, but you might not know it from an advertisement boasting that fact in Business Week magazine.

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> serviceman crossed the border today, one of more than 20 Americans who remained on the job in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> despite the kidnapping of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> a day earlier. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Timor </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said there were no plans to change <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> regulations that restrict Americans to the border and headquarters areas for most duties and require armed escorts for travel beyond those areas. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials he had full authority from the American government to travel wherever he wished, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said 16 American servicemen and a half-dozen civilians continued to work in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, most of them staying overnight at headquarters in <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION> to follow the search for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. One officer who identified himself as an American working for the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNTSO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- was seen crossing into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But he refused to give his name or answer a reporter's questions while waiting for Israeli guards to open the blue steel gate at the border checkpoint. Other American personnel reached by telephone at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> referred reporters to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, saying they were not permitted to speak. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, a Marine officer from <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was new on the job, taking up his post Jan. 8 as commander of 75 unarmed observers from 16 nations. He was kidnapped Wednesday while returning from the southern port city of Tyre where he met with a Shiite Moslem political leader. Asked why Americans were still working in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in view of recent abductions, <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said American observers had been under a travel ban since 1985. `` <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> felt he could n't abide by these restrictions. ... He assured us there would be no problems,'' <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> felt that as chief, he should be out with his men and know what they are doing,'' he said, noting <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> commanded a force made up largely of non-Americans. <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> indicated the Americans were safe because `` they are not serving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but under the U.N. flag.'' The border area is also more friendly for Americans because it is controlled by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and allied Christian militiamen. But <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was traveling outside this zone when he was taken. In general, <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said, Americans in the observer corps have been doing headquarters duties and working in observation posts along the Lebanese side of the border with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said one of the main functions of the observer group was to maintain contacts with local leaders, and <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' visit to <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> representatives was an initial courtesy call arranged through the Tyre <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office. `` Until now, we have always felt safe in Tyre,'' <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, the first <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeper to be kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was traveling alone and unarmed in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> vehicle, following another <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> vehicle with two observers, a <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> and an American. <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops from <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> were leading the search for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. He said the mainstream Shiite militia Amal was heavily involved in searches outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> zone. `` They are reporting to us, but we are not coordinating with them,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were encouraged by the fact that the militia was involved, noting there had been no active searches when Westerners had been abducted elsewhere in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 A son and a nephew of the late President <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> are among 20 people indicted in connection with four attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> diplomats in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s chief prosecutor announced today. Prosecutor General <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Guindi </PERSON> said he was seeking the death penalty for 11 of the defendants, including <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, eldest son of the late president. <PERSON> El-Guindi </PERSON> said he wants prison sentences up to life for the other nine, among them <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>'s nephew, <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawky </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, a physician. Both <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> relatives are fugitives outside <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Family members say the son is living with his wife and children in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and the nephew in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> El-Guindi </PERSON>'s indictment accused the first 11 defendants of forming a group called <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution to assassinate foreign diplomats, aiming to disrupt relations between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and several countries and to destabilize security within <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The indictment also charged the 11 with murder and attempted murder in the attacks, which occurred one a year between 1984 and 1987. Two Israelis died and six Israelis and two Americans were wounded in the attacks. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution was financed from abroad, el-Guindi told reporters, but he said investigations had not shown which country or countries were involved. The nine defendants for whom lesser penalties are being asked were accused of complicity in the alleged conspiracies. `` Under the name <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution, these men assassinated and attempted to assassinate diplomats with the aim of destabilizing the security situation in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and spoiling relations between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and those countries,'' el-Guindi said. `` There was no aim to overthrow the government.'' The defendants included two former military officers and a former corporal. Nine of the 11 for whom el-Guindi is seeking the death penalty had been arrested and ordered released by the courts. <PERSON> El-Guindi </PERSON> said they would be re-arrested. Large numbers of bombs, ammunition and weapons including machine guns were discovered with the defendants, he said. `` The financing came from abroad, but the investigation has not showed from where,'' el-Guindi said. The indictment said <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, 38, formed <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution along with <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Suliman </PERSON>, 47, a former administrative employee at the Egyptian Embassy in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Essam </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON> el-Sayed <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Suliman </PERSON>. The Sulimans are brothers. <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Suliman </PERSON> was the leader and fired weapons in each attack, the indictment said, and <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> handled the group's financial and material supplies. <PERSON> El-Guindi </PERSON> said the international police coordination agency <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> would be asked to help bring <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> back to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Neither <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawki </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> is reported to be, has an extradition treaty with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution first surfaced in 1984, when an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> labor attache was wounded. Its communiques claiming the attacks indicated a pan-Arab philosophy comprising the ideas of <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, republican <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s first president. <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> was revered throughout the Arab world and died in September 1970. Investigators said the group described itself in a letter to a magazine editor wounded in an attack by an underground Moslem fundamentalist group as `` Nasserite ... with weapons training, aiming to end the official presence of Israelis in the country.''

 A woman wounded by a spurned admirer in a shooting spree that left seven people dead says she was so afraid of the man she moved three times and sought a court order of protection. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, 26, who police say was the target of Tuesday's shootings at <ORGANIZATION> ESL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was haunted for four years by unwanted advances from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, a former co-worker, her lawyer said Black was one of four people injured in the siege. Black had asked a court to order <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, 39, to never bother her again, but she was shot and seriously wounded in her office the day before her hearing, authorities said. `` I have been afraid of what this man might do to me if I file this action,'' she said in her filing with the court. `` However, I am now at the end of my rope.'' In the filing, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said she obtained an unlisted phone number and moved three times, but <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> continued calling her at work, driving by her house and following her to softball games. <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittle </PERSON>, who issued a temporary order against <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> on Feb. 2, made it permanent Wednesday. `` This was a consciousness-raising incident,'' she said from the bench in tears. `` It shows pieces of paper do not stop bullets.'' Charges were being prepared against <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, who was being held in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, prosecutor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON> said Wednesday. Police Capt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said he expected them to include multiple counts of homicide, attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. A portrait of <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> as a man with a deadly obsession but no apparent criminal background or pattern of job problems emerged from comments by authorities, neighbors and former employers. When police searched a motor home owned by <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, they found a stockpile of guns and ammunition, along with cans of gasoline, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` He had a lot of guns and a lot of gun knowledge _ apparently a lifetime hobby,'' the captain said. Police say <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> was a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> native who never married, served 11 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> with an honorable discharge, and started at ESL, a <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> defense contractor, in November 1977. It was there that he met Black. When <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> failed to get dates with <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, he began living in a fantasy world, <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, said. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> took pictures of <PERSON> Black </PERSON> and used them to `` document'' their make-believe life, <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> said. Neighbors said <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, who lived in a dilapidated cottage with peeling paint, was a loner who never said hello to anyone. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> was fired in May 1986 from his $ 36,000-a-year job as a software development engineer after sending a letter threatening <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s life, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> DeRuntz </PERSON>, a company manager. The attack, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and Lt. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON>, who negotiated the gunman's surrender, was <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s way of `` making a point'' that he would n't tolerate being spurned by Black or laughed at by other ESL employees. `` He was in love with her from the first moment he saw her,'' said <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON>. `` It was her smile.'' After being fired, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> found other computer industry jobs, and his current employer, Sunnyvale-based Covalent Systems, released a statement Wednesday saying his work was satisfactory and there was `` no indication whatsoever of problems.'' At ESL, which does such work as outfitting military spy planes, president <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON> met with about 2,000 grieving employees outside the plant Wednesday. He said the deaths were `` like losing members of your own family.'' The company said the shootings did not result from any lapse of security. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> agreed, noting that <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> gained access by blasting his way through a computer-controlled door. The building where the shootings took place was closed Wednesday, but other buildings at ESL were open. Black suffered chest, shoulder and spine injuries in the shooting. Killed were <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Buddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, 23, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Moritz </PERSON>, 27, <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 26, <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Laparter </PERSON>, 49, <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, 46, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Doney </PERSON>, 36, <LOCATION> Manteca </LOCATION>. Injured in addition to Black were <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsley </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, wounded in the chest, arm, leg and hand; <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, shrapnel wounds to the face; and <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcotte </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, who broke her forearm trying to break a window to escape.

 Lots of folks head for the top of the Empire State Building when they visit <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But Australian <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, who took his first trip to the top on Wednesday, did it the hard way. He ran. `` It was n't too bad, really,'' said <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, a 26-year-old pastry chef from <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> after he won the 11th annual Empire State Building Run-Up. Still, he said, `` It gets a bit boring, going around and around and around.'' <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, who was married three weeks ago, said he won the chance to compete in the Empire State Building Run-Up by winning a similar event last August in a 56-story hotel in <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>. `` That one felt harder,'' he said. He attributed his victory in part to being the first man into the stairwell _ no small advantage, considering the crunch of bodies that followed him. <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, who finished in 11 minutes, 29 seconds, led a field of 79 men and 27 women who thundered up the stairwell to the top of the 102-story building for glory, fitness and the first-place prize of a computer. Eleven minutes after <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> crossed the finish line, along came <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> airman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, No. 77 of the 79 men. Savage ran and walked to the top. `` I did n't feel bad,'' he said, assessing his race afterward. `` I was just dying.'' <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, who is assigned to the aircraft carrier <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he grew up in <LOCATION> Cold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, where the tallest building is about four stories `` and that's a barn.'' So it was quite a thrill to be at the top of the Empire State Building, with all of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> spread out beneath hazy blue skies. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 29, is no neophyte to athletic competition or to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ he competed last year in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marathon </LOCATION> and runs 140 miles a week. `` But I was still dying,'' he said, grinning wildly in defeat. Winner <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> finished just a few yards ahead of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> physician from <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. The top women's finisher was Olympic marathon hopeful <PERSON> Janine </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiello </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, whose time of 13 minutes, 43 seconds, was 28 seconds off her women's record in the event, set in 1985. Ms. <PERSON> Aiello </PERSON> interrupted her Olympic training to compete for the fifth time in the Empire State Building event. `` It feels great,'' she said. `` My mom was here, my aunts from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It was just so great to see their faces.''

<HEAD>Widow Pleads Guilty To Wounding Son</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An 81-year-old widow in failing health has pleaded guilty to wounding her retarded son in a bungled mercy killing attempt she said was necessary because she loved him too much to leave him behind. `` Sometimes, a mother's love puts people in strange situations,'' Circuit Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> said before sentencing <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ingleside </LOCATION> to 30 months of probation. Ms. <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON> is required to live in the <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> nursing home that has been her home since her arrest in October, but she will be allowed supervised visits with her son, <PERSON> Block </PERSON> said. Her son <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, 51, lives at the <ORGANIZATION> Waukegan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Authorities said Ms. <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON>'s bullet went through his shoulder instead of his heart. `` I am very sorry that it ever happened,'' the wheelchair-bound widow said before her sentencing on a charge of aggravated battery Wednesday. `` I did n't want to leave him behind. I was going blind, and my health was failng by the day, and I was afraid that being the way he is, that he would be at the mercy of the world. `` I did n't want that, Your Honor,'' she told the judge. `` I love him too much for that. I think you can understand that.'' `` Oh, I think anyone with children can understand that,'' Block replied. Ms. <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON> could have been sentenced to a maximum of 53 years in prison. A grand jury declined to indict her on the more serious charge of attempted murder, which carries a mandatory prison sentence of six to 30 years. `` I do n't think society can condone what she did,'' said Prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said. `` But you can empathize with her feelings. I do n't have any qualms about the outcome.'' Ms. <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON> was a race-car driver in the 1920s, a dancer at the 1934 <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Fair and says she was the first woman to skydive from a bi-plane. She said she spent most of her life caring for her son because she did not trust anyone else. The state is paying for her son's care now, and Ms. <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON> will live on money from the sale of her small house, her lawyer said.

<HEAD>Inflation to Trim US Military, Diplomatic Ranks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and diplomats will face leaner times next year under what President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today called `` an essential minumum program'' for national security. The trillion-dollar budget <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> today will require the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to thin ranks and scrap some weapons, like the Midgetman missile now under development and 16 frigates already at sea. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> may be forced to close some overseas missions, but those have not been announced yet. The budget calls for a $ 294 billion ceiling for military outlays, up from 1988 outlays of $ 285.4 billion, but the increase is less than half the estimated 4.3 percent inflation rise this year. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spending is proposed to rise 2 percent above 1988 levels, to $ 1.74 billion. But a weaker dollar and inflation abroad have raised the costs of diplomacy, meaning the government may lay off personnel as some foreign outposts are shut. `` The proposals for national security contained in this budget represent an essential minimum program for keeping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> safe and honoring our commitments to our friends and allies,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Anything less would jeopardize not only our national security _ and that of our friends and allies _ but also would dim the prospects for further negotiated agreements with our adversaries,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The budget plans stand in sharp contrast to the military buildup of the first two years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, when defense spending increased by 12 percent and 13 percent. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> repeated his assertion that a mightier military strengthened his hand in diplomacy, as well. `` Weapons systems have been modernized and upgraded. We are recruiting and retaining higher caliber personnel. The readiness, training and morale of our troops have been improved significantly'' since the beginning of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1981, the president said. `` Because we are stronger, enormous progress has been achieved in arms reduction talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. Austerity in the proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1 is forcing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to plan on reducing the number of men and women under arms by 34,000, to a force level of 2,172,000, according to the budget. Reserve strength will remain at 1.7 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> will bear the brunt of the personnel cuts, losing 23,000 airmen, with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> losing 8,600 soldiers; the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, 2,900. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> will drum out an additional 10,000 civilians from a worldwide staff of 1,102,000, according to the documents. The cuts are expected to save $ 1.4 billion in personnel costs. More personnel savings could be realized if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> torpedoes a planned 4.3 percent pay increase. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s nuclear muscle may sag some. Pentagon planners want to cancel development of the single-warhead mobile Midgetman missile. But many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> prefer deploying the Midgetman to devising a way to move the MX missile by rail as a means of reducing Soviet ability to hit it in a first strike. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is expected to ask for between $ 100 million and $ 200 million to keep the Midgetman just barely alive. Air Force generals argue they can save more than $ 2 billion next year and $ 39 billion in the future by canceling the Midgetman, according to administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> also is expected to save $ 786 million by canceling its anti-satellite missile program; <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already has banned tests of the device for three years. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s hopes for a 600-ship fleet may be pushed beyond the horizon as that service readies mothballs for 10 frigates of the <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> class and six frigates of the <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> class built in the early 1970s. Sailors from those ships will go to other vessels, saving the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> from personnel cuts, except for the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. On the diplomatic front, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> may be headed back to the straits it faced last September, when a revenue shortfall of $ 60 million prompted Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to forecast the elimination of 1,270 jobs and the closing of more than a dozen embassies and consulates abroad. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> an extra $ 60 million for the current year.

 Inmates angry over the conduct of searches at the <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> city jail ransacked a dormitory, but surrendered peacefully this morning after guards using tear gas and batons forced one group out. Four inmates and four guards were injured, but not seriously, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON>, city commissioner of correction. The riot in the <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kross </PERSON> Center, which houses 2,700 inmates, started at midnight and was over by 3:30 a.m., he said. Most of the 550 inmates involved were state prisoners in jail for parole violations, <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> said. The inmates heavily damaged 12 dormitories, which house about 50 inmates each, and 350 state inmates will have to be transferred out of the city. They are being held in the gymnasium and other common areas until they can be moved. The inmates shattered chairs, tore apart doors and ripped beds from the walls, using the pieces of broken furniture to smash all the lights, he said. `` We lost about 600 beds,'' <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> said at a news conference in a trailer outside the prison gates. He could not estimate the cost of the damage and said it would take several days to repair it. The riot apparently was sparked by a weapons search Wednesday morning, during which seven state inmates had to be taken out of the dormitories `` because they objected to the search and interfered,'' <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> said. Those inmates were returned Wednesday night to the dormitories, where tensions were already high due to a stabbing earlier in the day. At midnight Wednesday, inmates in the four dormitories on the top floor began piling their beds and lockers against the door, keeping guards out. Inmates in the four dormitories on each of the other two floors followed suit. No hostages were taken, but when Supervising Warden <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> arrived to discuss the prisoners' grievances they refused to talk and began breaking out of the dormitories into the facility's hallways. At that point, <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> decide to use force, <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> said. Tear gas was fired into one dormitory. Then 200 officers armed with batons and wearing plastic helmets and padded jackets moved into the room and began physically removing the inmates. The inmates fought bac with chair legs, broken glass and other weapons made from the shattered furniture, <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> said. After the fight, the inmates in the other 11 dormitories agreed to talk to the warden and the barricades came down around 3:30 a.m., he said. Inmates complained that guards are using unnecessary force in weapons searches, <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasanof </PERSON>, chairman of the city <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION>, blamed the state prison system for the disturbance. `` This is in my view a state riot which has been exported to the City of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kasanof </PERSON> said. `` These are long-term prisoners for the most part, for whom the city prisons are ill-designed and for whom the state prisons are well-designed.'' The city's prison system is currently at 101 percent of capacity with more than 15,000 prisoners, about 11,000 of them at <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> said.

 Presidential hopefuls looking to recover from poor showings or to get ahead going into Super Tuesday are stumping in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, which offer the next big contests before the March 8 cluster of primaries and caucuses. For <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s precinct caucuses and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s primary could make or break his Democratic presidential bid, although <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> backed off from a statement that he would drop out if he lost in both states. `` If I do n't win either <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, I'm going to drop out of the race. I do n't want to just continue indefinitely running second or third,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had said early Wednesday. But he later told reporters, `` We're now hedging on that because of the reaction we've been getting from around the country.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, in desperate need of a showing above third place, also headed for <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Wednesday. Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and flew straight to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Wednesday in an urgent search for a primary victory to make good his claim that his party's race is a two-man contest between him and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the top Democratic vote-getter in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, has waged the most aggressive campaign of the Democrats in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and has a strong campaign in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. `` It gives us a tremendous shot in the arm,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> campaign director <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Forciea </PERSON> said of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> win. But <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was staking his claim too. `` The place where my natural roots are is right here in <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> land,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> campaign manager, said his campaign's polling shows that 30 percent to 40 percent of Minnesotans who have attended caucuses in the past are undecided. Additionally, he said, the polling suggests <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is the second choice of many <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters, and he expects some could come over to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> if they decide <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ca n't win the race. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who spent the most time campaigning in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were believed to have the best chances in that state, according to state party leaders. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> also was considered to have strong support in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, party officials said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has one of the best-organized Republican campaigns in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. While his state campaign chairwoman, <PERSON> Evie </PERSON> <PERSON> Axdahl </PERSON>, expressed confidence that he'll do well, she acknowledged that his showing could be affected by `` wild card'' <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the former television evangelist who has fared well in earlier caucus states. Senate GOP leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> campaigned extensively in both states, while Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made at least nine appearances in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> but did n't campaign at all in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Prior to the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, Republican insiders said they expected <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to run a close 1-2 in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s surprise second-place showing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> raised his supporters' expectations _ and his opponents' fears _ that he could do better than expected in the state. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have spent substantially more than their opponents in the two states, according to reports filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The Democratic events in both states are occurring earlier than national party rules allow, and the states were embroiled for months in a heated dispute with the national party. Under an agreement with national party officials, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s Democratic primary results are officially non-binding However, state party officials say the delegates selected at a March 12 statewide caucus will be be apportioned according to the popular vote. The agreement <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Democrats reached with the national party requires that a presidential preference poll taken at the precinct caucuses be kept secret until 5 p.m. on March 8. However, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Growe </PERSON> plans to report caucus-night results from both the Democratic and Republican events.

 `` The Last Emperor'' garnered nine Academy Award nominations, but this year's list of Oscar contenders is a diverse lot of epics, comedies and dramas, hardly a one-picture sweep. The comedy-romance `` Broadcast News'' received seven nominations Wednesday, and the wartime drama `` Empire of the Sun'' showed up six times in the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> list. The six nominations also received by the psycho-thriller `` Fatal Attraction'' and the offbeat love yarn `` Moonstruck'' reflect the Academy's orientation toward commercial hits rather than domination by artsy movies. `` Fatal Attraction'' took in $ 129 million at the box office and `` The Untouchables,'' with four nominations, brought in $ 76 million. At the same time, the good showing by `` The Last Emperor'' indicates the academy looks beyond what succeeds commercially, said the film's director, <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>. `` It's fantastic to have with me all my people, my collaborators who shared with me the Chinese adventure,'' said <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>, who noted his associates on the movie, the life story of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s last emperor, were a mixture of Italians, Britons and Chinese. `` What I think is a great satisfaction for me today is to see that <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> has given this recognition. ... The nomination already tells that there was for <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> a great proof of non-chauvinism... None of these nominated -LRB- for best director -RRB- is from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>,'' he said today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning, America. Best director nominee <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON> said he `` finds it tough to believe'' people really liked his movie, `` Fatal Attraction.'' `` I got up early, fearing and trembling, watching the live thing on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON> said. When the movie came up in category after category, `` I was bouncing up and down with my wife and the dog.'' `` Broadcast News,'' set in a television news bureau, brought nominations for stars <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. `` I'm on my way out to see the movie again to see what they are talking about,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was nominated for producing the picture and for writing it, but, startlingly, not for directing it. The nominations for `` Empire of the Sun'' also did n't include one in the directing category for <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>, who has yet to win an Oscar for best director despite being the top moneymaking director of all time. His film also was not among the best picture nominees: `` Broadcast News,'' `` Fatal Attraction,'' `` Hope and Glory,'' `` The Last Emperor'' and `` Moonstruck.'' Two-time winners <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> and Meryl Streep were nominated for their roles as Depression-era low-lifers in `` Ironweed.'' Best actor nominees also included <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> for `` Wall Street''; Hurt, `` Broadcast News''; <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastroianni </PERSON>, `` Dark Eyes,'' and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' `` It made me not only proud of our film ` Wall Street,' but it reminded me of what a wonderful part <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> created,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. Joining Miss Streep in the best actress list were <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, `` Moonstruck''; <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, `` Fatal Attraction''; Miss <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, `` Broadcast News;'' <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, who never was nominated in his many appearances as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, placed among the nominees for supporting actor for his role as the steely <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> cop in `` The Untouchables.'' Others in the race: <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, `` Broadcast News''; <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, `` Street Smart''; <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardenia </PERSON>, `` Moonstruck''; <ORGANIZATION> Denzel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cry Freedom.'' All of the supporting actresses were first-time nominees: <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleandro </PERSON>, `` Gaby _ A True Story''; <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, `` Fatal Attraction''; <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` Moonstruck''; <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, `` Throw Momma from the Train''; <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sothern </PERSON>, `` The Whales of August.'' `` Like my cousin, I'm in the running and now I'm waiting for ` Super Monday' in April,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, referring to the April 11 Academy Awards ceremonies. Hours earlier, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Democratic presidential primary.

 <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the outspoken former protege of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, was ousted from the ruling Politburo today, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Two rising stars in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy were named non-voting Politburo members, the official Soviet news agency said. The policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> made the changes after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the party leadership that his efforts to modernize the economy and Soviet society did not constitute a retreat from socialism. `` We are not retreating one step from socialism, Marxism-Leninism, everything which has been won and created by the people,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying. `` We are striving in the present conditions to revive the Leninist look of the new system, to rid it of the accumulations and deformations, of everything that shackled society and prevented it from realizing the potential of socialism in full measure,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Central Commiittee meeting `` freed Comrade B.N. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> from his duties as a candidate member of the Politburo.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 57, was brought into the ruling body by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in February 1986 and named <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss. But he fell from favor last fall when he complained to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at its last meeting that an entrenched bureaucracy had stalled <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to modernize Soviet society <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> earlier had been removed from his party post in the Soviet capital but was given a ministerial job in the government's construction bureaucracy, leaving his political future in doubt The move to drive him from power was seen as an indication the party remains unwilling to tolerate criticism in key areas, despite <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of `` glasnost,'' or openness, which has encouraged freer expression of ideas. He said his program is, instead, designed to root out dogmatism and bureaucracy. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON>, 52, a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> protege who has been handling party personnel matters for almost two years, would take a seat as a non-voting member of the Politburo. He has been a secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a key post in the Communist Party apparatus. Also named to candidate, or non-voting, membership was <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>, 50, who this month was named chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the body that historically has controlled the nation's planned economy. The party chief acknowledged that his program of `` perestroika,'' or restructuring, has caused some confusion. Perestroika seeks to decentralize control of industry and make plant managers responsible for their own products in an effort to streamline production, improve quality and make consumer goods available to the Soviet public. The Tass account said some people have questioned whether `` the new, unaccustomed forms of economic management and social life'' actually constitute a revision of fundamental Marxist-Leninist teaching. `` The awareness has been established now that perestroika is an objectively necessary stage of the development of Soviet society, whose essence is a transition to its new qualitative state,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> outlined plans for an overhaul of the country's school system, saying the rigid and centralized Soviet bureaucracy must ease its control over schools to allow more flexibility at the local level. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> is considered to rank second behind <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Western reporters are not allowed to attend the meeting of the more than 300 members of the policy-making body. The committee is composed of top national officials, regional and local party bosses, and Communists from the armed forces, government ministries, industry and agriculture.

<HEAD>Seven People Treated for Cyanide Exposure After Youth Commits
Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLADAY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 17-year-old chemistry student committed suicide by injecting a homemade cyanide solution into his veins, and seven people became ill after apparently handling the chemicals or breathing fumes, police said. The youth mixed up a substance like that used in execution chambers, said Lt. <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Latsis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fire hazardous materials officer. `` He knew exactly what he was doing.'' Sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggen </PERSON> was listed in serious condition at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mark </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> today. Fire officials said <PERSON> Haggen </PERSON>'s illness was compounded by an allergic reaction to a cyanide antidote. Three other sheriff's officers also became ill several hours after going to the teen-ager's home Wednesday morning. They and the deceased youth's parents and a 10-year-old sister were treated and released. The deputies apparently did not recognize the youth had died from cyanide, and had no idea they were in danger while in the room with his body, <PERSON> Latsis </PERSON> said. About four hours later they began experiencing headaches, nausea and tightness of the chest, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogle </PERSON>, fire battalion chief. Cyanide poisoning can occur from either breathing fumes or absorption through the skin. Gas had permeated the home when deputies arrived, but they and others in the home may also have handled some of the chemicals, the fire officials said. The 17-year-old, whose name was not released, was an advanced chemistry student at his high school. He died after creating a lethal dose of cyanide from several chemicals and injecting it into his veins, <PERSON> Latsis </PERSON> said. Sheriff's deputies said the youth left a note indicating that he was not getting out of life what he was putting into it. When cyanide was suspected in the illness of the deputies, family members were evacuated.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s wife and children shouted `` You're liars'' to prosecutors today after the defense rested in the former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker's Nazi war crimes trial. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>, son <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and wife, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, walked onto the stage of the converted movie theater where the year-old trial was held and shouted at the prosecutors. Security guards quickly ushered them out of the courtroom. The sobs of the women could be heard, followed by an angry expletive by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 67, appeared surprised, but did not otherwise react The Ukranian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is accused of being `` Ivan the Terrible,'' a brutal guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1942 and 1943. He was stripped of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship in 1981 and was extradited to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stand trial for war crimes. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> insists he is innocent and a victim of mistaken identity. The three-judge panel is expected to issue its verdict in April. The emotional outburst came after defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> ended his final arguments and prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaked </PERSON> rose to respond to accusations that the prosecution withheld from the defense documents that would exonerate <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shaked </PERSON> said the prosecution had provided all material to the defense `` on a silver platter,'' and even translated it. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 22, rose angrily from his front row seat, walked onto the stage, turned and said: `` You're a liar.'' He was followed by Mrs. <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>, 28, who shook her fist and tearfully cried: `` You're lying. Mrs. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> then rose, and in a heavily accented voice shaking with emotion, shouted: `` You're a liar! You liar. Shame on you. Shame on you. You have no heart _ nothing!'' She was pulled from the stage by two security guards. After the family's outburst, presiding Judge <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shaked </PERSON> and the three-member defense team: `` You both ought to do away with this bitterness because ... we believe there was fair treatment.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s family said, however, they did not believe <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> had received a fair trial. `` It's all been lies from beginning to end,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tearfully after the trial, her hands shaking. `` We just did n't expect the trial to end like that, to close with statements that are n't true. The defense should have been the ones to have the last say,'' she said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the family believed statements from 21 camp survivors who did not identify <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> as `` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON>,'' had been withheld by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the prosecution had not intervened to help. `` It's been a set-up from begining to end,'' he said. Resting the defense case, <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> called on judges to recognize the prosecution had not `` presented the proof necessary to convict this innocent man.'' `` Your honors, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s life is in your hands,'' <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said. `` I leave you with an Irish blessing: May God hold you in the palm of his hand while you deliberate the fate of my client, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said the judges would give the date of a verdict 10 days before it was to be announced. A separate sentencing hearing will be held about one month after the verdict if he is convicted. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of death.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. To the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>: As we consider the state of our nation today, we have much cause for satisfaction. Thanks to sound policies, steadfastly pursued during the past seven years, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is at peace, and our people are enjoying the longest peacetime economic expansion in our nation's history. By reordering priorities so that we spend more on national security and less on wasteful or unnecessary federal programs, we have made freedom more secure around the world and have been able to negotiate with our adversaries from a position of strength. By pursuing market-oriented economic policies, we have uncorked the genie of American enterprise and created new businesses, more jobs, improved production, and widespread prosperity. And we have done all this without neglecting the poor, the elderly, the infirm, and the unfortunate among us.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SEVEN YEARS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Let me note a few of the highlights from our administration's record of accomplishment: _ The current expansion, now in its 63rd month, has outlasted all previous peacetime expansions in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Business investment and exports are rising in real terms, foreshadowing continued economic growth this year and next. _ Since this expansion began, 15 million new jobs have been created, while the unemployment rate has fallen by 5 percentage points _ to 5.7 percent, the lowest level in nearly a decade By comparison, employment in other developed countries has not grown significantly, and their unemployment rates have remained high. _ Inflation, which averaged 10.4 percent annually during the four years before I came to office, has averaged less than a third of that during the past five years _ The prime interest rate was 21.5 percent just before I came into office; it is now 8.5 percent; the mortgage rate, which was 14.9 percent, is now down to 10.2 percent _ Since 1981, the amount of time spent by the public filling out forms required by the federal government has been cut by hundreds of millions of hours annually, and the number of pages of regulations published annually in the Federal Register has been reduced by over 45 percent _ Between 1981 and 1987, changes in the federal tax code, including a complete overhaul in 1986, have made the tax laws more equitable, significantly lowered earned income tax rates for many individuals and corporations, and eliminated the need for 4.3 million low-income individuals or families to file tax forms _ At the same time, real after-tax personal income has risen 15 percent during the past five years, increasing our overall standard of living

 The manufacturers of about 60,000 high-efficiency gas furnaces sold nationwide will inspect and repair units that may have become corroded, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said today. The repairs are being offered by <ORGANIZATION> Arkla </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Preway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evansville </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the commission said.

Those in the repair program include Century Reclaimer I and Comfort-Aire Reclaimer I sold by <ORGANIZATION> Heat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Elite </ORGANIZATION> sold by <ORGANIZATION> Trane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> CAC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; Elite sold by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>; some Arcoaire units sold by <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comfort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; some Comfortmaker furnaces sold by <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, and Recuperative I sold by <ORGANIZATION> Arkla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comfort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> are part of <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The companies have received 387 complaints of corrosion in the furnaces. Such corrosion could permit the escape of carbon monoxide, an odorless gas that can cause illness or death in large amounts, the safety commission warned. Signs of carbon monoxide poisoning include flu-like symptoms of headache, nausea, stomach upset and drowsiness. The furnaces have been found to be susceptible to corrosion when exposed to chlorine, fluorine, salt, paint stripper, fabric softeners, water softeners, bleach and adhesives. The commission said that the two companies will inspect the furnaces at no charge and, if necessary, retrofit them with upgraded components or replace them on a pro rata basis. Consumers needing more information can call Preway toll-free at 1-800-237-5207 or the safety commission at 1-800-638-2772.

 _ The outburst of spending for means-tested entitlement programs that occurred in the 1970s has been curbed Eligibility rules have been tightened to retarget benefits to the truly needy, and significant progress has been made in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs. _ We have begun the process of putting other entitlement programs on a more rational basis This includes <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, which was converted from cost-plus financing to a system that encourages competition and holds down costs. _ Federal spending for domestic programs other than entitlements has been held essentially flat over the last five years, while basic benefits for the poor, the elderly, and others in need of federal assistance have been maintained This is a dramatic improvement over the unsustainably rapid annual growth of these programs that prevailed before 1981. _ The Social Security system has been rescued from the threat of insolvency _ Our defense capabilities have been strengthened Weapons systems have been modernized and upgraded. We are recruiting and retaining higher caliber personnel. The readiness, training, and morale of our troops have been improved significantly. Because we are stronger, enormous progress has been achieved in arms reduction negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. _ Federal agencies have undertaken a major management improvement program called `` Reform'88. This program has two main objectives: to operate federal agencies in a more businesslike manner, and to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in government programs. _ Some functions of the federal government _ such as financing waste treatment plants _ are being transferred back to state and local governments In other instances _ such as water projects _ state and local governments are bearing a larger share of costs, leading to more rational decision-making in these areas. _ Finally, we have made real progress in privatizing federal activities that are more appropriate for the private sector than government Notable examples include the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>, the long-term lease of National and <ORGANIZATION> Dulles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airports </ORGANIZATION>, and the auction of billions of dollars in loan portfolios. _ Related to this shift away from the federal budget are our achievements on cost sharing and user fees, shifting the cost of projects and programs where appropriate to non-federal sources While we have reason to be proud of this record of achievement, we must be vigilant in addressing threats to continued prosperity.

 If the deficit is not curbed by limiting the appetite of government, we put in jeopardy what we have worked so hard to achieve. Larger deficits brought on by excessive spending could precipitate rising inflation, interest rates, and unemployment. We can not permit this to happen, and we will not.

<HEAD>Soviet Says Superpower Arms Talks Have Deteriorated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet deputy foreign minister said today that the superpower arms talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> had deteriorated and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was blocking agreement on cuts in intercontinental nuclear arms. `` It is difficult to forecast with a sufficient degree of certainty how these negotiations will proceed further,'' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said in a speech to the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament. He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> hopes that the visit of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next week `` will provide the necessary clarity as to the further intentions'' of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side regarding the arms talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The two sides have said they are trying to conclude a treaty on reducing their intercontinental, or strategic, nuclear forces by 50 percent in time for an expected U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in May or June. But both sides have said a summit could be held even if a treaty were not ready for signing. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is `` convinced'' that a treaty could still be prepared in time for signing at a summit in the first half of this year. But he said, `` A whole set of rather difficult issues remains to be solved.'' He reiterated the Soviet position that the main issue still to be resolved is the question of compliance with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control adviser <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that the Soviets were using delaying tactics at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks. He said the Soviets could speed up progress on strategic arms reductions by abandoning their efforts to link such reductions to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Strategic Defense Initiative research. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position at the talks `` impedes reaching agreement on the reductions in strategic offensive arms.'' For example, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was refusing to include limits on sea-launched cruise missiles because they say such limits would be difficult to verify. `` This being so, the situation at the space and nuclear talks has now noticeably deteriorated,'' said <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> also suggested that the Conference on Disarmament, the world's only multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, start negotiating on eliminating nuclear weapons in all countries which possess them. At a press conference, he said `` the time has come'' to take into account the nuclear arsenals of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, as well as of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which are already negotiating reductions in their forces. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> suggests to start immediately identifying in practice the substance of possible multilateral measures in this field,'' he said.

<HEAD>$8 Million Missing From Federal Reserve Shipment To Argentina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As much as $ 8 million from a $ 52 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency shipment to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> was lost as the bags of cash were being transferred from a jet to an armored <ORGANIZATION> Brink </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> truck in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Two 6-foot-long sacks of cash, believed to contain $ 4 million each, were reported lost, the newspaper said. The cash was being shipped by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Neither it nor Brink's, which was providing security, would identify the customer. Thirteen sacks were loaded aboard a regularly scheduled <ORGANIZATION> Varig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 747 at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Feb. 4., the newspaper said <ORGANIZATION> Varig </ORGANIZATION> is an Argentine carrier. The bags were lost after the jet landed at <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and the money was being loaded into an armored truck which was to transfer it to a flight to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the News said. `` The loss is under investigation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, by <PERSON> Brink </PERSON>'s here and in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and by airlines security and the police in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, a Brink's spokesman at the company's <LOCATION> Darien </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, offices. `` In reality, we do n't know where the loss occurred.'' He put the loss at `` more than $ 5 million,'' but the <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said sources told it the loss was $ 8 million. <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Sotnick </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, would say only that `` we gave an amount of money for transportation for a bank customer.'' The Fed deals with `` our counterparts,'' central banks of other nations and international banking institutions, <PERSON> Sotnick </PERSON> said. According to the newspaper, the money went by <PERSON> Brink </PERSON>'s truck from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> airport. It was loaded into the bulk cargo hold of <ORGANIZATION> Varig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight No. 861 with security by Brink's. In <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, four of the bags were placed on a cart that somehow was wheeled into a baggage room, said sources who were not identified by the newspaper. When the cart was found, two of the sacks, which are so heavy they require two men to lift one, were missing. The rest of the money was shipped to <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> will skip tonight's Democratic presidential debate in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to devote `` complete attention'' to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> ahead of caucuses and primaries in those states next Tuesday, an aide said today. The debate in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> is the first major event on the calendar prior to the pivotal Super Tuesday round of contests. Though <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> edged away from his statement Wednesday that he had to win either <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to stay in the race, it is apparent the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator is banking his future hopes on good showings in those states. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> concentrated on raising money Wednesday night and Thursday, picking up about $ 150,000 in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and moving on to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> this morning. Aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> collected $ 250,000 last week and hoped to gather another $ 400,000 in a series of fund-raisers this week. <PERSON> Carle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has already made 10 trips to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and saw no need to attend tonight's debate. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> began Wednesday telling television interviewers that he had to finish first in Tuesday's <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> caucuses or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary to stay in the contest for his party's nomination. Later, addressing an airport rally _ at which about 100 supporters greeted him with signs urging `` Hang Tough, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'' _ <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he was disappointed in his second-place finish in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses Feb. 8 and in his third-place finish in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s primary Tuesday. Those losses, he said, came by a total of fewer than 6,000 votes. `` It's like getting on the one-foot line, and you do n't quite score that touchdown,'' he said, adding, `` I have to win next Tuesday in either <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>.'' By late Wednesday night, however, he was telling reporters at a series of fundraisers, `` We're now hedging on that because of the reaction we've been getting from around the country.'' He also said he planned to run in his home-state <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary March 15. As for <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he was optimistic about his chances. He told a <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> that `` the place where my natural roots are -LRB- is -RRB- right here in <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> land.'' So far, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said, he has 35 delegates in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Missouri Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has 38 and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has 48, he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> finished second in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> behind <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, and third in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` In terms of delegates, it's almost a three-way tie right now, but you ca n't continue to run second and third indefinitely _ that's part of reality,'' he said. Aides said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s campaign has debts of about $ 500,000, with about $ 200,000 on hand, and expects to raise $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 this week, including about $ 150,000 at fundraisers in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> before heading back to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> today.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration today issued an economic forecast any Republican presidential candidate could run on with pride, predicting a record sixth year of peacetime economic growth with no increase in inflation. The administration, which in the past has been derided for its `` rosy scenarios'' of future economic activity, presented an optimistic view that the current expansion will continue into the indefinite future. And it derided initial recession fears from the October stock market crash as `` greatly exaggerated.'' `` Despite the sharp reversal in stock prices, however, the real economy has shown few signs of serious damage,'' the budget forecast stated. While the economic assumptions that underpin the president's 1989 budget are more optimistic than the predictions made by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and most private forecasters, they are not as far from the general consensus as in previous years Indeed, the administration boasts that its economic forecast a year ago, which was also above the general consensus, turned out to be closer to right. The economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew 3.8 percent in 1987, when measured from the fourth quarter of 1986. The administration had predicted 3.2 percent growth. `` Most forecasters failed to anticipate the magnitude of the improvement in the manufacturing sector just then getting under way,'' the budget stated. For 1988, the administration predicts manufacturing will remain a source of strength with export sales continuing to rise because of the weaker dollar. The administration predicts the overall economy will expand at a 2.4 percent annual rate this year with much of that growth coming from the improving trade deficit. This compares to a CB0 growth forecast of 1.8 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> forecast is the same as the consensus view of 51 top economists surveyed by <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION>, an investment newsletter. Among the economic assumptions, the administration predicts: _ GNP growth will rebound in 1989 to a 3.5 percent rate and stay above 3 percent through 1993 _ Consumer inflation, which rose 4.4 percent last year, will rise by 4.3 percent this year and decline steadily over the next four years to a 2 percent rate in 1993 _ Unemployment, because of the modest growth, will show no improvement this year, remaining at 5.8 percent at the close of the year, matching the current level However, the jobless rate will begin declining modestly in future years, dropping to 5.5 percent in 1989. These assumptions provide the basis for the administration's hopes of making further progress in getting the federal budget under control The 1989 spending plan, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s eighth submission to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has a valedictory quality about it, reviewing in detail the president's economic goals when he took office in 1981 and trying to explain the reasons for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s biggest economic failure, the string of record budget deficits. The administration, as it has in the past, put much of the blame on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for failing to enact its domestic spending cuts. But the budget also says the 1981-82 deficit played a large role, adding $ 112 billion to the deficit in 1983 alone. The new budget calls for reducing the federal deficit to $ 129.5 billion in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, down from an actual budget deficit of $ 150.2 billion in the 1987 fiscal year and an estimated deficit of $ 146.7 billion for the current fiscal year. The 1987 deficit was originally put at $ 148 billion but was revised in today's budget document. The 1989 budget estimate is below the target of $ 136 billion called for in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, but the administration concedes that its estimates in the past have fallen victim to worse-than-expected economic performance. Those pitfalls could derail the current plan as well, the administration says, noting that if GNP growth is just 1 percent lower than the administration is forecasting over the next five years it would add $ 6.3 billion to the 1989 deficit and $ 66 billion to the 1993 deficit. A minority of economists is predicting an even worse outcome for this year, forecasting the economy will fall into an actual recession. If growth is slower than the administration forecasts, or in a worst-case scenario, the country does enter a recession, then that would mean smaller federal tax revenues and higher spending for such programs as unemployment benefits. The current economic recovery began in December 1982, following the worst recession since the Great Depression, and is now in its 63rd month, surpassing the old record for a peacetime recovery of 59 months set between 1975 and 1979.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged the pressing need to reduce the deficit when, in December 1985, it enacted the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, commonly known for its principal sponsors as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings -LRB- G-R-H -RRB- Act. This act committed both the president and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to a fixed schedule of progress toward balancing the budget. In 1987, the budget deficit was $ 150 billion _ down $ 71 billion from the record level of $ 221 billion reached in 1986. This was also a record decline in the deficit. To some extent, however, this improvement represented one-time factors, such as a high level of receipts in the transitional year of tax reform. Economic forecasters predicted that without action the 1988 and 1989 deficits would be higher than the 1987 level. In order to prevent this, and to preserve and build upon the 1987 deficit-reduction progress in a realistic fashion, last fall the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> modified the G-R-H Act. Specifically, it required that the 1988 deficit target be $ 144 billion and the target for 1989 be $ 136 billion. Last year, members of my administration worked with the leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to develop a two-year plan of deficit reduction _ the Bipartisan Budget Agreement. One of the major objectives of the budget I am submitting today is to comply with that agreement _ in order to help assure a steady reduction in the deficit until budget balance is achieved. The Bipartisan Budget Agreement reflects give and take on all sides. I agreed to some $ 29 billion in additional revenues and $ 13 billion less than I had requested in defense funding over two years. However, because of a willingness of all sides to compromise, an agreement was reached that pared $ 30 billion from the deficit projected for 1988 and $ 46 billion from that projected for 1989. In submitting this budget, I am adhering to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement and keeping my part of the bargain. I ask the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do the same. This budget does not fully reflect my priorities, nor, presumably, those of any particular member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But the goal of deficit reduction through spending reduction must be paramount. Abandoning the deficit reduction compromise would threaten our economic progress and burden future generations. This budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit is possible without abandoning tax reform, without cutting into legitimate social programs, without devastating defense, and without neglecting other national priorities. Under the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, progress toward a steadily smaller deficit and eventual budget balance will continue, but this projected decline rests on two assumptions: continued economic growth, and implementation of the agreement. If the economy performs as expected, and if the Bipartisan Budget Agreement reflected in this budget is adhered to, the deficit should decline to less than 3 percent of GNP in 1989. For the first time in several years, the national debt as a proportion of GNP will actually fall. Reducing the deficit and the debt in this manner would bring our goal of a balanced budget and a reduced burden on future generations much closer to realization. Moreover, adherence to the agreement, as reflected in this budget, will ensure the achievement of additional deficit reductions in future years, because in many cases the savings from a given action this year will generate deficit savings in subsequent years. Given the good start made in 1987, we have an opportunity this year to put the worst of the deficit problem behind us.

 The investigation into the case of a black teen-ager who claims she was sexually assaulted by six white men has again reached an impasse with lawyers for the victim saying they will not cooperate with prosecutors. Representatives of the victim met with state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the special prosecutor investigating the case, for 12 hours Tuesday and Wednesday but failed to secure a pledge from <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> that he would personally handle several key aspects of the case. Without that, `` we are unable to give him the cooperation that he is demanding of us,'' <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an attorney representing <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> and her family, said at a news conference after Wednesday's meeting. `` There is no way that we can agree that we have, instead of a special prosecutor, a case manager,'' he said. `` We are looking for a special prosecutor to personalize this case.'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said in a statement that he was committed to personal participation in, as well as overall responsibility, for the case. But he said it was too early to make the specific tactical decisions demanded by <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, attorney <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, and activist <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the investigation will continue without the cooperation of Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> or her attorneys. The two sides have no immediate plans to meet again, said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' spokesman, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Wappinger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, claims she was repeatedly raped and assaulted last November by six white men, one of whom flashed a police badge. She was found four days after her disappearance in a daze, wrapped in a plastic bag. Racial epithets had been scrawled on her body. This week's talks followed a meeting Feb. 11 between Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s representatives and Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, which appeared to break a stalemate that had stymied the investigation. Previously the representatives had refused to allow <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> or her family to cooperate in the probe, saying they did n't think <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, the aide <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> had picked to head the investigation, had sufficient experience in civil rights matters. The attorneys later said they had been assured by <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> that <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> would be `` personally involved'' in the investigation. In the meetings this week the representatives made Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s cooperation conditional on <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> personally conducting certain aspects of the case, including grand jury presentation and direct examination of several witnesses, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. `` I have indicated that I do not rule out performing any or even all of these roles myself,'' said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. `` However, we are far from any trial here, we are far from even solving this case, and these are questions of trial tactics that I and my staff of prosecutors feel can not in good conscience be made at this time.''

<HEAD>MEETING NATIONAL PRIORITIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In formulating this budget, I have endeavored to meet national priorities while keeping to the terms of the Bipartisan Budget Agreement and the G-R-H Act. In essence, the agreement limits the 1988-to-1989 increase in domestic discretionary program budget authority to 2 percent. To address urgent national priorities insofar as possible within this overall 2 percent limit, my budget proposes that some programs _ such as those for education, drug enforcement, and technology development _ receive larger funding increases, while others are reduced, reformed, or, in some cases, terminated. High-priority programs must be funded adequately. One of our highest priorities is to foster individual success through greater education and training oppoortunities. For example: _ I propose an increase of $ 656 million over the $ 16.2 billion appropriated for 1988 for discretionary programs of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> Although state and local governments fund most educational activity, federal programs provide crucial aid for the poor, the handicapped, and the educationally disadvantaged. _ I have proposed reform of our overcentralized welfare system through state experimentation with innovative alternatives In addition, my initiative would overhaul current employment and training programs for welfare recipients, and strengthen our national child support enforcement system. _ By emphasizing housing vouchers, I would provide housing assistance to 135,500 additional low-income households in 1989 _ 8 percent more than the 125,000 additional households receiving housing subsidies in 1988 _ Ineffective programs to assist dislocated workers would be replaced by an expanded $ 1 billion worker readjustment program -LRB- WRAP -RRB- carefully designed to help those displaced from their jobs move quickly into new careers In addition, I am proposing funds to strengthen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology and make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> more competitive. For example: _ I propose a continued increase in federally supported basic research aimed at longer-term improvements in the nation's productivity and global This budget would double <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> support for academic basic research, increase support for training future scientists and engineers, and expedite technology transfer of government-funded research to industry. _ I would provide $ 11.5 billion for space programs, including: essential funding for continued development of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first permanently manned space station; increased support for improving the performance and reliability of the space shuttle; a major new initiative, the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility, for space science; further support to encourage the commercial development of space; and a new technology effort, Project Pathfinder, designed to develop technologies to support future decisions on the expansion of human presence and activity beyond <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s orbit, into the solar system _ I also recommend $ 363 million in 1989 to initiate construction of the Superconducting Super Collider -LRB- SSC -RRB-, including $ 283 million for construction and $ 60 million for supporting research and development The SSC as currently envisaged will be the largest pure science project ever undertaken. It will help keep this country on the cutting edge of high energy physics research until well into the next century.

<TEXT>
 As the presidential candidates head South from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, Southern political leaders are predicting that Super Tuesday will broaden the presidential debate into a discussion of issues of national concern. To help focus that debate, the <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> released a report Wednesday outlining a series of issues important both in the South and in the nation as a whole. The report urges the presidential candidates, for example, to explain how they would combat illegal drugs, eradicate illiteracy, promote energy independence in the face of rising oil imports, reform the welfare system and develop impoverished rural areas. Former <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> told a news conference that Super Tuesday will shift the campaign `` from retail to wholesale politics'' by forcing the candidates to address such national issues rather than the more narrow agenda of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> voters. A total of 20 states, 14 of them in the South, will hold primaries or caucuses on Super Tuesday, March 8. The 20 states will select 28.2 percent of the delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> and 30.3 percent of the delegates to the Republican National Convention.

 The financial challenge of waging a simultaneous campaign in 20 states has presidential campaigns fresh from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> scheming about where to get money for the expensive Super Tuesday contest. Most campaigns are close-mouthed about how much they want to spend on the March 8 series of Super Tuesday primaries, which include all the Southern states but one. But the only one who is already on the air with commercials in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, _ Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, Jr. of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> _ said he will spend up to a minimum of $ 3 million on television ads alone. `` You could spend an infinite amount'' running ads in all 20 states, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON>, campaign manager for Democratic contender Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has just enough money to meet his $ 200,000 in outstanding bills, said <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON>.

 City officials stockpiled water in reserve tanks today after about 100,000 gallons of a toxic chemical leaked from a ruptured <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> pipeline, threatening water supplies for 22,000 people and forcing 500 to be evacuated. The <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> warned officials of this northwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city to plan to stop drawing water soon from the <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> because some of the toluene had flowed into the river near <LOCATION> Tiffin </LOCATION>, nearly 20 miles upstream. About 300 people in the town of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> were ordered to evacuate their homes today as the spill moved downstream, said <LOCATION> Seneca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Neff </PERSON>. About 200 residents in an 18-square-mile area along the <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> were evacuated Wednesday night. Three people were treated for exposure to toluene. A firefighter inhaled the fumes, and two other people fell into ice-covered contaminated water. Fremont's reserve tanks have been filled. They hold about 4 million gallons, about one day's normal supply, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathfelder </PERSON>, assistant superintendent of the water plant. He said the city will close the water intake valves just before the spill reaches the city. The spill was about 12 miles upstream from <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION> and would reach the city in about two days, he said this morning. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, environmental coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said officials are not sure how much toluene had leaked into <LOCATION> Sugar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, a tributary of the <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Earthen dams were built on the creek to block further movement of the chemical into the river. `` It's not the kind of stuff you want in a river,'' he said. `` It wo n't kill you, but you do n't want to be around it for too long.'' Toluene is a flammable chemical that can produce irritating or poisonous gases, according to an emergency response guidebook published by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. The chemical is used as an octance enhancer. <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, Okla.-based Sun Pipe Line, said he learned late Wednesday that some of the chemical spilled into the river and could affect Fremont's water supplies. Sun Pipe Line is a division of the <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We'll naturally begin something to make sure they get emergency water supplies,'' he said. <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> said the spill was caused by a split in the line that might be connected to a 20-gallon leak earlier Wednesday. The pipeline runs from a Sun refinery in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to a refinery in <LOCATION> Marcus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Workers have not pinpointed the leak, however, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnet </PERSON>, an environmental safety coordinator for Sun Pipe Line. `` It's been shut off, but it's still leaking,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Asks Increases to Fight AIDS, Boost School Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today for major spending increases to fight the spread of AIDS and to boost support for schools and colleges. Most social programs showed at least modest gains in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s election-year budget for fiscal 1989, as the president abandoned perennial proposals for cuts that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has largely ignored in previous years The most striking increase was the $ 1.3 billion request for research and education on the deadly AIDS virus, up by $ 349 million, or 38 percent, from the current level. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` Addressing the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome epidemic is the highest public health priority of the administration.'' The government also estimated that its cost of paying welfare and Medicaid benefits for AIDS victims will soar in the year ahead to $ 736 million from $ 461 million. That makes the total federal costs more than $ 2 billion. One year after he sought to cut nearly $ 5 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>'s budget, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to raise its spending by $ 1.5 billion, or nearly 8 percent, to $ 20.3 billion. The biggest education gain would be in the <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> program for needy college students, which would climb by $ 590 million to almost $ 5 billion. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would raise the maximum grant to $ 2,300, a $ 100 increase, and award 247,000 more grants. The program now helps 3.15 million college and trade school students. Disadvantaged children in elementary schools would be helped by two budget increases: a $ 238 million increase to $ 4.6 billion for the Chapter 1 remedial education program, and a $ 43 million boost to $ 115 million in aid for magnet schools. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants to make the magnet school aid available more freely, and not just for school desegregation. Carrying through on an initiative announced in the State of the Union address, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he will propose legislation to allow low - and middle-income families to earn interest tax-free on savings bonds for college The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' budget would grow by 5.8 percent, from $ 375.1 billion to $ 396.8 billion, including Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. Social Security's old age and disability programs alone are expected to grow by $ 14 billion, or 6.4 percent, to $ 233.8 billion. `` The administration proposes no changes in Social Security benefits,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Thirty-eight million people receive benefits, and the average retired worker and spouses will draw $ 10,500 in 1988, an increase of nearly $ 3,700 over the 1981 level. Medicaid grants, which help states provide health insurance for 25 million poor people, will cost the federal government $ 32.7 billion in 1989, up 7 percent from $ 30.7 billion currently. Under the recent budget agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed no Medicaid cuts for 1989. Medicare spending, for 33 million elderly or disabled workers, is projected to rise to $ 84 billion from $ 78.9 billion, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed $ 1.2 billion in cuts to meet the deficit-reduction targets that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration agreed to in December. The budget proposes to limit <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payments for durable medical equipment, reduce payments for radiology and anesthesiology services, `` close a loophole in payments for home dialysis treatment for end-stage renal disease,'' intensify screening of physician claims by program contractors, and make permanent a requirement that <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Part </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> monthly premiums _ now $ 24.80 _ cover 25 percent of the program costs. The budget proposes phasing out the low-income energy block grant over four years, starting with a $ 300 million cut to $ 1.2 billion for 1989. It would also reduce the community services block grant by $ 57 million to $ 349 million, and eliminate funds for the $ 93 million Work Incentive Program for welfare families.

 Canadian authorities are investigating a report that an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> was offered the job of assassinating Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, a spokeswoman said. `` We are aware from press reports of the allegations that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> was approached in 1984 to assassinate the prime minister,'' Constable <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` We are actively pursuing an investigation of this allegation with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. We have no further comment at this time.'' <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> is serving three life terms in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for murder. His classified ad in Soldier of Fortune magazine led to a $ 22.5 million suit against the publication by the family of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> woman. They claim the 1984 ad led to the woman's murder. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> said in a deposition read in federal court Wednesday that responses to his advertisement for `` high-risk assignments'' included one seeking the assassination of the president of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The deposition, given Oct. 13 and read in a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> court, did not go into detail about the Canadian assassination request and did not mention <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> by name. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> also has claimed that Canadians financed the aborted overthrow of the president of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guiana </LOCATION> to the tune of $ 100,000. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> said in a deposition that the Guianese president was terrorizing the population with murderous hit squads. But <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guiana </LOCATION> is a protectorate of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and has no president. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> alleged that he and 11 others trained in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> for about six weeks before setting out for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country. They aborted the `` mission'' when they developed engine trouble while flying over the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some of the nation's biggest corporations have endorsed a so-called workplace bill of rights, pledging to actively educate workers about AIDS and protect the rights of employees who have the deadly disease. The pledge unveiled Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> says people with AIDS or exposed to the suspected AIDS virus `` are entitled to the same rights and opportunities as people with other serious or life-threatening illnesses.'' The pledge endorsed by 30 employers adds that they `` do not pose a risk of transmission of the virus to coworkers through ordinary workplace contact.'' Requiring workers or job applicants take blood tests for the virus is specifically rejected, as is divulging medical information about an employee, it says. But, it said, `` Employers should provide employees with sensitive, accurate and up-to-date education about risk reduction in their personal lives.'' <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was the first company to endorse the principles, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucotti </PERSON>, cochairman of the commission, said at a news conference. Others are <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner-Lambert </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the teachers' unions of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shubert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>; Ms., <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, Sassy and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and World Report magazines; <ORGANIZATION> Rubenstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, the Girl Scouts, <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Randolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Education Fund, Fund for the City of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Wildcat Services and <ORGANIZATION> Archie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comics </ORGANIZATION> `` Those companies that have subscribed to these principles have been very courageous,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, executive director of the Lambda fund. `` They have been willing to take the heat because they understand the gravity of the problem. We will continue to have the problem of stigmatization until all companies subscribe to these principles.'' The 15-member commission was established in July and funded by 17 local foundations. <PERSON> Zucotti </PERSON> said its mission is to marshal information and mobilize effort to improve care for AIDS sufferers, promote prevention and education about the fatal affliction and address its social impact. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. There is no known cure. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> estimates that AIDS will strike 270,000 Americans and kill 179,000 by the end of 1991. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> already has received reports of more than 28,000 deaths of people with AIDS.

 Maintaining peace in a troubled world is the most important responsibility of government. Fortunately, during the past seven years, our defense capabilities have been restored toward levels more consistent with meeting our responsibility to provide an environment safe and secure from aggression. Specifically, combat readiness has been improved, and our forces have been modernized. The proposals for national security contained in this budget represent an essential minimum program for keeping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> safe and honoring our commitments to our friends and allies. Anything less would jeopardize not only our security _ and that of our friends and allies _ but also would dim the prospects for further negotiated agreements with our adversaries. As called for in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, my budget requests defense funding of $ 299.5 billion in budget authority and $ 294 billion in outlays for 1989. It also provides for about 2 percent real growth in these programs in future years. Also, as called for in the agreement, my budget requests $ 18.1 billion in budget authority for discretionary spending for international affairs. This includes $ 8.3 billion in security assistance to allied and friendly countries where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has special security concerns.

<HEAD>NEEDED PROGRAMMATIC REFORMS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Incentives: It is essential to continue to change the incentive structure for many domestic federal programs to promote greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This budget proposes to create such needed incentives. Many federal programs offer payments without sufficient regard for how well taxpayers' money is being spent. For example, farm price support programs, under the Food Security Act of 1985, are much too costly. I plan to continue pushing for the elimination of artificially high price supports, thereby reducing the need for export subsidies. In particular, I plan to propose amendments to the act to modify the counterproductive sugar price support program that currently poses significant problems in the areas of trade policy, foreign policy and agricultural policy. The importance of agricultural trade to the economic health of the farm sector and the nation as a whole mandates increased reliance on free markets, not government largess. The budget proposes certain reforms in the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program in order to achieve the savings agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement. First, as justified by the results of several independent studies, I propose to reduce the add-on payment for teaching hospitals under the prospective payment system -LRB- PPS -RRB- for indirect medical education from 7.70 percent to 4.05 percent, the best estimate of the added costs incurred historically by teaching hospitals. Second, I propose to limit Medicare overhead payments for graduate medical education and make consistent varying secondary payor enforcement mechanisms. To reduce escalating supplementary medical insurance costs and help slow future increases in beneficiary premiums, I propose to limit payments for certain overpriced physician procedures, limit payments for durable medical equipment and supplies, and eliminate a loophole in the payment process for kidney dialysis. In total, these reforms would reduce spending for Medicare by $ 1.2 billion from the level that would occur if current law were continued. Spending for the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program would still increase by 7 percent from 1988 to 1989.

 Former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, declaring `` I am free,'' today abandoned his faltering campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination but vowed to carry on his fight for `` the politics of truth.'' The first Democratic casualty of 1988, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said he was not ready to endorse any of the six Democrats still in the race. After finishing fifth in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and sixth in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s campaign for the Democratic nomination clearly had no place to go. At a news conference, the former governor, whose wit had drawn sympathetic coverage from the media said, drew laughter when he said people had told him, `` You fought a good fight, you were in it right up to the beginning.'' `` I do n't know why we fared no better,'' he went on. `` I'll leave that for others to ponder. Looking back on his campaign, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't say I loved every minute of it, but I loved most of it.'' He recalled the occasions during his campaign when he asked people to stand up if they supported his call for candor, especially his advocacy of a national sales tax to help reduce the federal budget deficit. `` I'll never forget the people in audience after audience who stood up out of their chair to join me in a demonstration of belief for the politics of truth,'' he said. `` I stood up for what I believed in,'' he added. `` They stood up for me. That's what this last year has been about. Because a campaign is more than a candidate. A cause is more than a campaign. This candidate is withdrawing. This campaign is closing down. But the cause that it stood for has just begun.'' In answering reporters' questions, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> displayed the wit and self-deprecating humor that characterized his campaign. Asked if he would consider the vice-presidential spot, he replied, `` You probably ought to select a vice-presidential candidate from a state with more than seven electoral votes.'' He added that if reincarnated he would try to be from the neighboring delegate-rich state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Asked how the generally favorable press coverage he received affected the race, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> joked, `` You engaged in a deliberate conspiracy to destroy my candidacy by making me into kind of a house pet ... to destroy my credibility with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Addressing his party, which has lost four of the last five presidential elections, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said, `` It is up to us to give our country a compelling reason to elect us to power.'' `` I'm going to wait and watch and do everything I can to insure the success of our party,'' he said. The 48-year-old former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor spent Tuesday and Wednesday consulting friends, supporters and family members about his decision, which he planned to announce at a news conference today. He said his two children urged him to `` stay in it as long as you've got half a chance,'' while his wife <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON> contended conversely that `` timing and grace are a big part of life and politics.'' `` There's a point at which you just do n't emulate <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Stassen </PERSON> forever,'' he added in reference to the perennial Republican presidential candidate from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> finished sixth out of a seven-man field on Tuesday in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, garnering 5 percent of the vote. Only former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> received less. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s campaign is broke and contributions `` slowed to a trickle'' after his fifth-place finish in last week's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses where he had staked virtually all of his resources, said campaign spokesman <PERSON> Vada </PERSON> <PERSON> Manager </PERSON>. He said he would not endorse any of the other Democrats right away, although <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has already sought his support. And <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> urged him to stay in the contest when the two spoke Tuesday night, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said. `` He said, ` You've got something to say. You're a courageous guy. There's nothing shameful about losing.''' Furthermore, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> noted that the large number of candidate debates this year allows them to have a platform without spending a lot of money. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> is about $ 150,000 to $ 200,000 in debt, aides said. Manager said donations `` slowed to a trickle'' after <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s poor showing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. But money was not the main problem, said <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, noting in his usual wry style, `` A lot of my friends are saying the money's never been a problem. You never had any money, so why should you get excited about not having any money now?'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> approached his campaign with a non-traditional style from the beginning, turning to unusual outdoor attention-getters such as a bicycle ride across <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, an ascent of Mt. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and a rugged cross-country ski tour in northern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. He attracted favorable press reviews for his candor, his wit, and the depth of his economic proposals. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> often poked fun at himself and his low standing in the polls with such quips as, `` Nobody ever told me I was going to be a front-runner and so far I have fulfilled that expectation.'' He said his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> loss was not surprising after the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> defeat, but that he had hoped to get at least 10 percent of the vote. Asked to explain what went wrong in his campaign, which he launched last March 10, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said: `` I would sum it up by saying this: When you have a new messenger and a different and challenging message at the same time, it's a hard sell.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> left open the possibility he might take another shot at the presidency in 1992. `` It was a great try and I do n't regret a minute of it,'' he said. `` Who knows, maybe I'll ride back into town again.''

<HEAD>Woman Sentenced to 12 Years For Attempted Murder of Policemen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nathalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Menigon </PERSON>, a suspected member of the Direct Action terrorist group, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for the attempted murder of two policemen in 1980. After deliberating for 35 minutes late Wednesday night, a special criminal court panel of seven judges sentenced Ms. <PERSON> Menigon </PERSON> for firing at the two policemen on Sept. 13, 1980, when they closed in on her and her companion, <PERSON> Jean-Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouillan </PERSON>. The policemen were not killed. Prosecutor <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barreyre </PERSON> had asked for a 15-year sentence. Ms. <PERSON> Menigon </PERSON>, 31, was the first of seven suspected Direct Action members scheduled to be tried in the next two weeks for crimes ranging from robbery to attempted murder. She, <PERSON> Rouillan </PERSON> and defendants <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipriani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Aubron </PERSON> have been on a hunger strike for 75 days to protest their isolation in prison and to demand the right to receive more visitors. All have been in the hospital section of <LOCATION> Fresnes </LOCATION> prison. The four are believed by authorities to be among the original members of <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed responsiblity for the November 1986 assasination of French General <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Audran </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and the January 1985 slaying of <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Besse </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> company, in <LOCATION> Yvelines </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Those killings are still under investigation, and the current trial deals with other crimes committed between 1980 and 1983. Ms. <PERSON> Menigon </PERSON>, pale and thin, entered the courtroom for the opening of her trial Wednesday in a wheelchair and accompanied by two nurses. She refused to answer questions, saying she was too weak. She denounced the trial as `` the negation and theft of who I am, of my identity as a militant communist revolutionary.'' The seven defendants were convicted last week of the common charge of criminal association and received varying sentences up to 10 years in prison. All the suspected top members of Direct Action were arrested Feb. 21, 1987, at a <LOCATION> Loire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> farm. Authorities said the arrests effectively put an end to the terrorist group.

Neighbor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fua </PERSON> said <PERSON> Groshe </PERSON> `` played with the gun all the time.'' `` He waved it around and would point it at anything: buses, trees, the water tower,'' said <PERSON> Fua </PERSON>, 19. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police Detective <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> was pronounced dead today at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said police spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, 36, and five other plainclothes officers went to an apartment Wednesday night with a search warrant to look for illegal drugs, said police spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Santry </PERSON>. When they met resistance, they began to force their way into the apartment, and two shots were fired from inside, <PERSON> Santry </PERSON> said. Police did not return fire, he said. Five men in the apartment were taken into custody for questioning, and one of them was charged in the shooting, <PERSON> Santry </PERSON> said. Two <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> officers were wounded Jan. 29 during a drug operation. An alleged cocaine dealer who turned a shotgun on an officer was killed.

<TEXT>
 A French warship today found and destroyed a drifting mine in the northern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, French naval officials said. Mine-sweeping forces continued their withdrawal from the waterway. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its report that a Japanese cargo vessel had struck a mine off the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, saying it now appeared that the ship may have collided with a recently sunken freighter. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter carrier <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> headed down the gulf to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with the four helicopter mine sweepers sent to the region last August. The RH-53D Sea Stallions, originally eight in number, spent six months searching for mines ahead of convoys of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers. Although they found none, the aircraft accomplished their mission of protecting the convoys, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers say. The <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> news agency quoted French naval officials in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> as saying the corvette <LOCATION> Montcalm </LOCATION> today had used gunfire to destroy an `` old mine'' earlier found floating in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gulf </LOCATION>. It gave no other details, but it appeared the mine may have been one previously spotted by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s navy several days ago. The mine sank and was lost, the Saudis reported. The French said it brought to 11 the number of mines, all believed laid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, that its navy had found and destroyed in recent months. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> said the 4,842-ton auto carrier <ORGANIZATION> Prosper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, which suffered mysterious damage to its bottom while sailing off <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> on Wednesday, may have struck the submerged superstructure of the Greek-owned motor vessel Mare. The 15,241-ton, Panamanian-flag freighter sank in 50 feet of water off the port of <PERSON> Jebel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> on Feb. 4 while being towed to a shipyard. It had been gutted by fire in an Iranian gunboat attack, then abandoned by its crew, five days earlier. Shipping executives said divers found the hull of the Prosper World had been damaged, possibly by running aground. They ruled out a mine as the cause. The <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, the first major ship to be withdrawn from the <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>'s gulf-based <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION> since last summer's emergency buildup of forces to counter the threat of Iranian attacks, was heading for home port at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Its departure will eventually scale down the force from 17 to 16 ships, including six ocean minesweepers that arrived in November to replace the helicopters. The battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and two other ships were withdrawn earlier from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> task force operating in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> outside the gulf, in support of the navy's escort operations. The five European navies that also sent a total of 14 mine sweepers to the gulf are now in the process of cutting back those forces by about half.

<TEXT>
 Although the provision of needed legal services for those who can not afford them is an important goal in our society, the current system earmarks a large portion of the funding to `` National and State Support Centers'' that have been critized for political involvement. I urge <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to disallow use of federal funds for such `` think tanks'' and limit the use of funds to the direct assistance of the poor in need of legal aid. The government often continues programs at the federal level that are no longer needed. This is the case with rural housing programs, the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, urban mass transit discretionary grants, urban development action grants, sewage treatment, <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> direct loans, housing development action grants, the housing rehabilitation loan program, and economic development programs of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>. Efforts to reverse this situation have been undertaken by prior administrations as well as my own, but the limited results to date indicate the difficulty of curbing excessive government involvement in these areas. Regulatory Relief: For seven years I have worked to reduce the excess burdens of government regulation for all Americans _ working men and women, consumers, businesses and state and local governments. As a result, various departments and agencies have reduced the scope and costs of federal regulation. Federal approval of experimental drugs has been expedited, making them available to treat serious or life-threatening diseases when other treatments do not work. Excessive burdens on state and local governments are being lifted. Access to goods and services has been made easier, and at less cost. Federal reporting requirements on individuals and businesses have been eased, as well as the paperwork burden on those who wish to compete for contracts with the federal government. Under the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Regulatory Relief, headed by the vice president, the administration will continue these and other efforts to lessen the burden of excessive government regulation. As a case in point, my budget proposes termination of the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, contingent upon enactment of legislation that completes deregulation of the motor carrier industry. There is no justification for continued economic -LRB- as opposed to safety -RRB- regulation of surface transportation, and there is a substantial argument against it. As a result of economic deregulation of trucking and railroads, consumers save tens of billions of dollars each year, and the industry is healthier, more innovative and better able to adapt to changing economic circumstances. This is no time to turn back the clock. Privatization: The government and the private sector should do what each does best. The federal government should not be involved in providing goods and services where private enterprise can do the jobs cheaper and @ or better. In some cases, the fact that no private provider exists is a reflection of government policy to prohibit competition _ as with first class mail service. In other cases, an absence of private providers reflects a government policy of providing large subsidies _ as with uranium enrichment. Invariably, the taxpayer ends up paying more for less.

 Accordingly, my budget proposes that a number of federal enterprises be transferred back to the private sector, through public offerings or outright sales. Following our successful sale of <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> and auctioning of $ 5 billion in selected loan portfolios, I am proposing the sale not only of the Naval Petroleum Reserves, but also of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the federal government's helium program, excess real property and a further $ 12 billion in loan portfolios. In addition, I have proposed legislation to authorize a study of possible divestiture of the <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and plan to study possible privatization of our uranium enrichment facilities, as well as ways of making the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service more efficient through greater reliance on the private sector. Such `` privatization'' efforts continue to be a high priority of this administration, and I look forward to acting on the final recommendations of the <ORGANIZATION> Privatization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which I established last September. Privatization does not necessarily imply abrogation of government responsibility for these services. Rather, it recognizes that what matters is the service provided, not who provides it. Government has an inherent tendency to become too big, unwieldy, and inefficient; and to enter into unfair competition with the private sector. The federal government should also depend more on the private sector to provide ancillary and support services for activities that remain in federal hands. Therefore, I am proposing the development of a private mediating institution to reduce the backlog of cases before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. I propose that the private sector be relied upon for booking functions for concessional food programs. I also encourage the complete privatization of wastewater treatment plants, certain mass transit projects, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, our administration plans to initiate privatization and commercialization efforts involving federal prison industries, relying on a private space facility for micro-gravity research opportunities in the early 1990's, commercial cargo inspection, military commissaries, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> buoy maintenance and the management of undeveloped federal land. Moreover, my budget proposes that the work associated with certain federal employment positions be reviewed for the feasibility of contracting their responsibilities out to the private sector as yet another way to increase productivity, reduce costs and improve services. One of the best ways to test the worth of a governmental program or a particular project is to shift some of the cost of that program or project to the direct beneficiaries. We have done that, for example, with water resources development projects. As a result, local sponsors and users choose to proceed only on the projects that are most important and most cost effective.

 Management Improvements: As we all know, the federal government has a major effect upon our daily lives through the direct delivery of services, the payment of financial assistance through various entitlement programs, the collection of taxes and fees and the regulation of commercial enterprises. As the 21st century approaches, the federal government must adapt its role in our society to meet changing demands arising from changing needs and requirements. At the turn of the century, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population will exceed 268 million, with a greater proportion of elderly requiring more specialized services. The nation will operate at a much faster pace as changes in technology and communication link the world's economies, trade, capital flows and travel as never before I have asked the Office of Domestic Affairs and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> to work with the President's Council on Management Improvement to conduct an in-depth review and recommend to me by this August what further adjustments in the federal role should be made to prepare for the challenge of government in the 21st century. This summer I will receive their report, `` Government of the Future.'' I also intend to complete the `` Reform'88'' management improvement program I started six years ago to ovwerhaul the administrative, financial and credit systems in our federal government; to implement productivity and quality plans in each agency; and to examine the needs of the federal work force of the future. I want to leave a legacy of good management of today's programs, with plans in place to handle tomorrow's challenges Efforts to improve the management of the federal government must be continued. We have all heard stories of the horrible waste that occurs in the federal government. Some of it is obvious _ like the billions of dollars in unneeded projects that were included in the thousand-page 1988 spending bill that was dropped on my desk last December. Some are not obvious _ like the billion dollars in unnecessary interest expense the government paid, year after year, because it lacked a cash management system, or the billions of dollars lost annually for lack of a credit management process to ensure collection of the trillion dollars in loans owed the federal government. In July 1980, I promised the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people: `` I will not accept the excuse that the federal government has grown ... beyond the control of any president, administration or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ... we are going to put an end to the notion that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer exists to fund the federal government. The federal government exists to serve the American people ... I pledge my administration will do that.'' I have delivered on that promise. The first step was taken within months after my inauguration when I formed the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, composed of the agency inspectors general. By the time I leave office, they will have delivered savings of over $ 110 billion in reduced waste, fraud and abuse to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. Then, in March 1982, I initiated the world's largest management improvement program with these words: `` With Reform'88 we're going to streamline and reorganize the processes that control the money, information, personnel and property of the federal bureaucracy.'' I told my cabinet at that time that `` we have six years to change what it took twenty or thirty to create _ and we came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to make changes!'' I have followed up on that commitment. The President's Council on Management Improvement has overseen this effort, and is generating significant results.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry operated at 82.2 percent of capacity in January, matching the December level as the highest operating rate in almost eight years, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said that further growth in the operating rate was held back last month by cutbacks in steel and automobile production. The last time that American industry operated at higher than 82.2 percent of capacity was in March 1980, when production was at 83.7 percent of capacity. During the 1981-82 recession, the operating rate fell below 70 percent. The operating rate climbed to 81.8 percent in August of 1984 as the country pulled out of the recession. However, manufacturers in many industries laid off workers and closed plants in 1985 and 1986 as foreign competition cut into sales. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration began a campaign in 1985 to force the value of the dollar lower in an effort to make American products competitive once again on overseas markets. That effort began reaping benefits last year with the operating rate rising by 2.4 percentgage points in 1987. By contrast, operating rates had fallen by 0.9 percentage point in 1986. The administration, which today released its latest economic forecast as part of its 1989 budget, is counting on a resurgent manufacturing sector to keep the country out of a recession during this presidential election year. Many private economists, however, believe that growth will slow considerably, especially during the early part of 1988, as businesses cut back on orders in an effort to work down high levels of unsold goods. Economists said the January report on factory use showed that process had already begun. The operating rate in the auto industry dropped by 1.2 percentage points in January to 76.7 percent of capacity. It was the third consecutive monthly decline after auto plants hit an operating rate of 82 percent in October. Steel and other makers of primary metals saw their operating rates drop to 89.6 percent of capacity last month, down from 91.2 percent in December. For all of manufacturing, the operating rate was unchanged at 82.4 percent of capacity. Producers of durable goods, such as steel and autos, saw operating rates decline to an average of 79.9 percent of capacity, 0.1 percentage point below the December level. Makers of non-durable goods saw operating rates rise by 0.1 percentage point to 86.1 percent of capacity. The mining industry, which has been hardhit by declines in oil prices, had a 0.3 percentage point drop in the operating rate to 80.2 percent of capacity. This was offset, however, by a 0.9 percentage point increase in the operating rate at utility companies, which rose to 81.6 percent in January. The big gain was attributed to unusually severe winter weather which boosted heating demands.

 Nude drawings of women that county officials ordered removed from a courthouse gallery can not be barred from the exhibit, a federal judge ruled today.

County officials established the gallery about 10 years ago. `` They have indeed elected to enlighten or otherwise to open the public court as a designated forum ... for the display of art,'' <PERSON> Kosik </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corveleyn </PERSON>, assistant county solicitor, had argued the art should be screened because people often had to pass the gallery for court business and not by choice.

 These efforts are described in greater detail in my Management Report, which is being submitted concurrently. They can succeed only if all federal managers and employees work together. Therefore, I propose in this budget a new approach to paying federal employees who increase their productivity. I ask the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to modify the current system of virtually automatic `` within-grade'' pay increases for the roughly 40 percent of employees eligible each year to one that is based on employee performance. This will give federal employees stronger incentives to improve service delivery and reduce costs to the taxpayer.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE BUDGET PROCESS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 As I have stressed on numerous occasions, the current budget process is clearly unworkable and desperately needs a drastic overhaul. Last year, as in the year before, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not complete action on a budget until well past the beginning of the fiscal year. Th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> missed every deadline it had set for itself just 9 months earlier. In the end, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a year-long, 1,057-page omnibus $ 605 billion appropriations bill with an accompanying conference report of 1,053 pages and a reconciliation bill 1,186 pages long. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had only 3 hours to consider all three items. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should not pass another massive continuing resolution _ and as I said in the State of the Union address, if they do I will not sign it. I am asking for a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget and forces the federal government to live within its means. A constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget _ and a provision requiring a super-majority vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to increase taxes _ would impose some much-needed discipline on the congressional budget process. Ninety-nine percent of Americans live in states that require a balanced state budget, and a total of 32 states already have passed resolutions calling for a convention for the purpose of proposing a balanced budget amendment to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution. Also, I am asking the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a line-item veto, so that my successors could reach into massive appropriation bills such as the last one, cut out the waste, and enforce budget discipline. Forty-three state governors have a line-item veto; the president should have this power as well. As governor of the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> -LRB- 1967-1975 -RRB-, I used the line-item veto 943 times. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> State legislature upheld each of these vetoes, even though both Houses were controlled by the opposition party. In addition, I propose the following further reforms to the budget process: -LRB- 1 -RRB- Joint budget resolution. The budget process has so degenerated in recent years that the presidential budget is routinely discarded and the congressional budget resolution is regularly disregarded. As a remedy, I propose that henceforth the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Executive collaborate on a joint resolution that sets out spending priorities within the receipts available. The requirement of a presidential signature would force both branches of government to resolve policy differences before appropriations measures must be formulated. The budget process could be further improved by including in the budget law allocations by committee as well as by budget function. -LRB- 2 -RRB- Individual transmittal of appropriation bills. The current practice of transmitting full-year continuing resolutions skirts appropriations committee-subcommittee jurisdictions. More importantly, it does not permit the legislative and executive branches to exercise proper scrutiny of federal spending. Therefore, I propose a requirement that appropriations bills be transmitted individually to the president.

The attorney argued that authorites have unfairly taken the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> shootout into account when considering parole, against the orders of the judge who reversed the conviction and despite a prison record he described as exemplary. <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> was seeking <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s release on bail pending a ruling on his request that the convict be paroled for a 1966 murder-robbery in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Superior Judge <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> denied bail, telling <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> she did n't have authority to grant it.

Five counts contained in four charges were dismissed later when the government said there were evidentiary problems. <PERSON> Hambright </PERSON>'s case has been presented to a grand jury twice. He had been charged in January 1987 with molesting a 2-year-old boy at the day care center but was freed when the boy was found incapable of testifying and the judge refused to allow second-hand reports of his statements. His indictment again last October triggered an investigation that resulted in the examination of almost 100 children from the day care center for signs of physical or psychological abuse.

 The publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Soldier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fortune </ORGANIZATION>, defending the magazine against a lawsuit by a slain woman's family, says he had no way of knowing a classified advertisement in the journal would lead to the woman's death. The family is seeking $ 22.5 million from the magazine, accusing it of negligence for publishing the ad that brought <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> together with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> and led to the murder-for-hire of <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON>. `` I have no idea what's in the minds of people who place those ads,'' Publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> testified Wednesday. The <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> woman was shot to death in 1985. Her husband is on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' death row for paying <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> $ 10,000 to carry out the killing. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> is serving three life terms in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for murder. <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Einmann </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s mother, and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, the victim's 18-year-old son, are seeking $ 2.5 million in actual damages and $ 20 million in punitive damages from the Colorado-based magazine. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON>'s ad appeared in four issues in late 1984, seeking former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and weapons specialists with jungle warfare expertise for `` high risk assignments'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or overseas. `` I never expected anyone to be so stupid to advertise in Soldier of Fortune their intent to do criminal enterprise,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Under questioning by plaintiff's attorney <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> reviewed more than two dozen classified ads run in the magazine up to 1984. Many of the ads sought or advertised the services of self-proclaimed mercenaries, weapons specialists, explosives experts and mechanics, a term <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said was synonymous with hired killers. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said a `` mechanic'' in a `` high risk assignment'' also could mean someone who could fix a helicopter overseas. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> said in a deposition read into testimony Wednesday that his ad brought responses from people who were looking for help with bombings, assaults, jail breaks and killings. He said <PERSON> Black </PERSON> first contacted him about the sale of a gun collection and at their first meeting suggested he needed help to kill his wife. After several discussions, <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> said he killed Mrs. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> in February 1985 by shooting her twice in the head at her house. In response to a question whether Soldier of Fortune or its publisher were responsible for his illegal activities, he replied: `` If I had never run an ad in Soldier of Fortune ... I would have never killed anyone.'' Attorneys for the magazine do not dispute the magazine ad brought <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> and Black together, but they insist <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had no way of knowing the ad was for illegal activity. Magazine attorney <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said the magazine was focused on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and the classified ads were run as a source of employment for them, but also appealed to military historians and people who like adventure. According to <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON>, whose deposition was taken last October, the ad he placed was intended to attract bodyguard and security work.

<HEAD>WASHN: the president.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 -LRB- 3 -RRB- Strict observance of allocations. During the 1980s, an unacceptable budget practice evolved within the Congress of disregarding congressionally approved function allocations. Funds regularly were shifted from defense or international affairs to domestic spending. I strongly urge that each fiscal year separate national security and domestic allocations be made and enforced through a point of order provision in the Budget Act. -LRB- 4 -RRB- Enhanced rescission authority. Under current law, the president may propose rescissions of budget authority, but both Houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must act `` favorably'' for the rescission to take effect. In 1987, not a single rescission was enacted, or even voted on, before expiration of the 45-day deadline. I propose a change of law that would require the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to vote `` up or down'' on any presidentially proposed rescission, thereby preventing the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from ducking the issue by simply ignoring the proposed rescission and avoiding a recorded vote. -LRB- 5 -RRB- Biennial budgeting. The current budget process consumes too much time and energy. A two-year budget cycle offers several advantages _ among them, a reduction in repetitive annual budget tasks, more time for consideration of key spending decisions in reconciliation, and less scope for gimmicks such as shifting spending from one year to the next. I call on the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to adopt biennial budgeting. -LRB- 6 -RRB- Truth in federal spending. _ As part of my <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, I will shortly transmit legislation that will require any future legislation creating new federal programs to be deficit-neutral. In addition to requiring the concurrent enactment of equal amounts of program reductions or revenue increases, my proposal would require that all future legislation and regulations be accompanied by financial impact statements, including the effect on state and local governments. Adoption of these reforms should enable the federal government to make informed decisions in a deliberate fashion that fosters rational priorities. The American people deserve no less from their elected representatives.

<BYLINE>CONCLUSION</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Looking back over the past seven years we can feel a sense of pride in our accomplishments. Important tasks remain, however. The large and stubbornly persistent budget deficit has been a major source of frustration. It threatens our prosperity and our hopes for lessening the burden on future generations. Two years ago, the legislative and executive branches of government responded to this threat by enacting the G-R-H Act, which mandated gradual, orderly progress toward a balanced budget over the next several years. My budget achieves the 1989 target of the amended act while preserving legitimate programs for the aged and needy, providing for adequate national security, devoting more resources to other high-priority activities and doing so without raising taxes. My budget also embodies the Bipartisan Budget Agreement reached last November. In presenting this budget, I am keeping my end of the bargain. I call upon the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to uphold its end _ by ensuring that appropriations and other legislation are in full accord with the agreement. By exercising this measure of restraint and self-discipline, we can secure great benefits for the nation: a lower budget deficit, reduced demand on credit markets, more stable financial markets, a steadily declining trade deficit, and continued prosperity with non-inflationary growth. And, by reforming the budget process, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can improve its decisionmaking and garner the thanks of a grateful public. Surely, these are small prices for what is at stake. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Feb. 18, 1988

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> today for the first campaign stop since his big <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> primary victory, saying he would n't change his recent grass-roots strategy and quickly visiting a truck stop to prove it. Not long after arriving on Air Force Two at <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> northwest of here, the vice president had his motorcade pull over for a stop at <ORGANIZATION> Sto </ORGANIZATION>'s Auto and Truck Plaza. Sticking with the strategy that had him visiting plants and driving heavy equipment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited the Tin Lizzie Restaurant at the truck stop, passed out vice presidential tie clips and bought two coffees. Accompanied by Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Mo </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked a woman, `` You gon na vote for this guy Then vote for his friend. He's for me.'' Wending his way around the dining booths, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told another woman, `` Thought you were going to have a quiet cup of coffee, did n't you?'' On his arrival at the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> airport, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was greeted by a small but enthusiastic crowd as a school band played in a steady rain. `` Proud to be back. We're going to keep talking about the issues,'' he said in a brief airport talk. `` I do n't have to change one iota. The message that won in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> is a good message for the entire <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' One day earlier, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s complaints about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign statements. `` Talk about the issues. Keep it on a high plane,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in response to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s accusation that he distorted the senator's record in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaign advertising <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday he did n't think his 9-point victory over the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary was a fluke, although he said he will `` take nothing for granted'' in the coming Southern and border-state contests. In <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, he was scheduled to speak at high schools in <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON> and Friestatt before traveling to <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> to attend the `` Ozark Jubilee'' festival before heading to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The vice president, while deflecting criticism of the negative ads he ran in the waning days of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaign, told reporters Wednesday he wanted to focus on issues, rather than personalities. `` You all want me to talk about Senator <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. I want to talk about the issues,'' he said. `` You want to talk about history. I want to talk about the future.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sidestepped any detailed response to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s charge that the vice president had misstated his positions on tax increases, an oil import fee, and the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. Asked point-blank whether he had lied about <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s record, the vice president replied, `` I think I said it was n't true. ... I'm not going to dwell on it You see, I do n't want to be drawn into something like that.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on Wednesday portrayed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his campaign aides as the hatchet men of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential campaign. `` You're seeing a mean <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he said, and promised to swing back if attacked again. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, during remarks to campaign staff workers at his national headquarters here, promised that he would hew closely to the new-look, grass roots-style campaign strategy he used in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> as he seeks support in the the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses on March 8. On that day, 16 states or territories will be holding <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primaries or caucuses, with more than 700 delegates at stake. `` We stayed on those issues -LRB- in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> -RRB-. We do n't have to change a single thing,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to campaign in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> on Friday, before returning to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to prepare for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate debate there.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has signed legislation designating Tuesday of this week as Lithuanian Independence Day, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will never recognize the `` forcible incorporation'' of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In a proclamation signed last week, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> enjoyed `` political and religious freedom for all citizens'' following its declaration of independence on Feb. 16, 1918. `` Then, in June 1940, the year after the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> invaded and illegally occupied <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and the other <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the president said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> unequivocally condemned this violation of national sovereignty and national integrity, and ever since then our policy has remained consistent. We have never recognized the forcible incorporation of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and we never will,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Police and civilian auxiliary officers prevented Lithuanians from celebrating the 70th anniversaru of their short-lived independence on Tuesday, and activists said four Lithuanian nationalists were put under house arrest.

 The father of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> died today, one day after <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was abducted in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 72, died at 7:45 a.m. of heart failure at <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazle </PERSON>. He had been hospitalized with congestive heart failure, and his son came home in September on emergency leave from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to see him. The Marine's mother died in April 1979. The younger <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' family had been trying to reach him with news that his father was near death when they learned of his kidnapping. `` We're very saddened. It's a double shot here, you might say,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who is married to <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' sister, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. `` It's been very trying times because we've been here at the hospital off and on for two weeks Then we hear this. If one thing's bad, two is worse.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> told WHAS-TV that she called <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' wife, Marine Maj. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday to get him home from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as soon as possible so he could see his father before he died. That's when Mrs. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> learned of the abduction. Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who works in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s public affairs office, was informed of her husband's disappearance by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> about 9 a.m. Wednesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and daughter <PERSON> Chrissy </PERSON>, 17, are `` hanging in there real well,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prucha </PERSON>, a co-worker of Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> at the Pentagon. The two are `` tough ladies.'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' wife and daughter did not talk to reporters outside their home Wednesday. <PERSON> Prucha </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> would continue to work full-time. `` She's going to continue to do what she does on a daily basis,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, was on temporary detail serving as the chief of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization's <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was kidnapped Wednesday on the coastal highway between <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s southernmost port of Tyre and the border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>, site of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force's headquarters. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military person in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> allowed to travel alone and freely in the area. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' uncle, <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, said he expects his nephew will act like an officer and a gentleman. `` He loves his country. ... I do n't think they could bring enough pressure or pain to cause him to betray his country in any way. I think he would die first,'' said <PERSON> Eagle </PERSON>, 86, a former circuit court judge. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said the father is too ill to understand what happened to his son. `` The man has not opened his eyes in a couple of days. There's no way he could be able to comprehend, although he may be able to hear,'' he said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' family lived in central <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> when he was born in nearby <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION> and later moved to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, where he graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1963. After graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> on a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ROTC scholarship in 1967, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> earned masters' degrees in human resources management at <ORGANIZATION> Pepperdine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and in political science at <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The government of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> appealed for emergency aid Thursday to combat an epidemic of sleeping sickness it says has affected more than 10,000 people in the southern part of the landlocked African nation. The Chad Embassy in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said the areas of <PERSON> Randa </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Dobana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Belama </PERSON> and Tapol near the headwaters of the <LOCATION> Logone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> were the worst affected. `` The health services can no longer cope with the number of victims, who are being accommodated in tents or temporary shelters,'' the embassy said. Sleeping sickness is caused by a microscopic organism known as a trypanosome that enters the bloodstream through the bite of the bloodsucking tse-tse fly. The often-fatal disease is related to encephalitis and is permanently present in many parts of equatorial <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, although rarely on an epidemic scale.

<TEXT>
 A military jury today began deliberations in the retrial of Marine Cpl. <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> on charges he raped and tried to kill another <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>'s wife. `` I am very confident that we will win it,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, said. `` I just think there's justice in the world.'' Attorneys for both sides in <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s second court-martial wrapped up their cases Wednesday. Civilian defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leino </PERSON> charged that the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> used improper lineup techniques and led the victim to her identification of <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. He said there was no forensic evidence linking <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> to the April 1983 crime. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was convicted of abduction, rape, sodomy and attempted murder, but the verdict was overturned July 7 by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on grounds he had an inadequate defense. <PERSON> Leino </PERSON> said prosecutors also convinced the victim that <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> committed the crime. `` In her mind, someone has to pay,'' he said. <PERSON> Leino </PERSON> said it is ludicrous to believe that <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, `` a good Marine, nothing but a good person,'' snapped and committed a heinous crime. Military prosecutor Maj. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> focused on the testimony of four investigators who said the passenger side of <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s car had been wiped down the day after the attack at the <ORGANIZATION> Quantico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> base. `` Was there a conspiracy here to make this up?'' <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> said. `` Absolutely not. There's no conspiracy here.'' `` We think that the motive in this case was sex ... and we believe that the intent was murder,'' <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> also noted the victim positively identified <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> as her assailant from the witness stand and from physical and photographic lineups. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s chief alibi witness, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ausby </PERSON>, testified she saw <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> in a store where she worked as a security guard at the time of the rape. The store is about 15 minutes from the base.

<HEAD>Reagan Asks Tax Break to Help Parents Finance College</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday for a new tax break to help parents finance a college education for their children. In a budget recommending only a few tax changes, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called for requiring all state and local government employees to pay a tax for Medicare coverage. He proposed a permanent tax benefit for owners of shares in mutual funds and an expanded break for independent oil producers. In general, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed budget for the 12 months beginning next Oct. 1 reflect his reluctance to recommend tax expenditures that would worsen the federal deficit, and his opposition to raising taxes to cut that deficit. However, in his written message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the president noted that `` costs of post-secondary education have increased substantially in recent years, often faster than inflation. As a result, parents may have difficulty bearing these costs unless they establish a savings program for this purpose when their chidren are young.'' To help solve that problem, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he will propose that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> exempt from taxation the interest earned on certain bonds that are redeemed to pay for college or vocational education of a taxpayer, spouse or dependents. The tax exclusion would be targeted on lower - and middle-income taxpayers and would be phased out as incomes rise Neither the limitation on how much interest could be excluded nor the phase-out level has been decided by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The idea is not a new one; in fact, several bills with a considerable amount of support are pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to achieve the same goal. One bill, by Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont., would allow a family to buy a maximum of $ 2,000 worth of tax-free bonds per year If the bonds were cashed for any purpose other than education, the interest would be taxed and the owner would have to pay a 10-percent penalty. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' bill would allow the interest exclusion for regular savings bonds that students already own, assuming those bonds are used to finance an education. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal would allow the benefit only for bonds issued after 1988. The administration estimates its proposal would cost the government $ 10 million next year. By 1991, that would rise to $ 100 million. Other revenue proposals in the budget would: _ Require all state and local government employees to pay the 1.45-percent <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> tax Most workers, including state-local employees hired after March 31, 1986, already pay the tax as part of their Social Security payroll tax. The president wants all hired before that date to pay as well, on grounds most of them are eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> benefits through their spouse or by having worked previously in a non-government job. This would cost those workers $ 1.6 billion in 1989 and $ 2.1 billion in 1990. _ Make permanent a one-year tax break enacted in December for owners of mutual-fund shares, saving those shareholders $ 400 million a year One provision in the 1986 tax overhaul allows deduction of miscellaneous expenses _ such as union dues _ only to the extent they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income. The law also requires mutual funds to pass along to shareholders certain costs of managing the funds, which must be reported as income. Without the special tax break, many shareholders would have no way of deducting those costs. _ Make permanent a special tax credit, expiring at the end of 1988, for increased expenditures for research and experimentation This costs the government $ 400 million a year. _ Allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that operate abroad to allocate at least two-thirds of their research expenses to domestic income, saving them $ 600 million a year _ Permit the targeted-jobs tax credit _ under which the government pays a share of the wages of poorer workers _ to expire as scheduled at the end of 1988 _ Repeal the `` windfall-profit'' tax on the oil industry, which was enacted in 1980 to take a portion of sharply rising oil prices <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says the tax makes no sense now that prices have fallen significantly. _ Modify rules under which independent oil producers may claim the oil-depletion deduction The changes would allow the deduction even when certain oil properties are obtained from major oil companies and even when the writeoff exceeds net-income limitations. This would save producers $ 52 million in 1989. _ Repeal a congressional provision that would automatically cut taxes on airline tickets and aviation fuel when federal spending for airport and airways improvements drops below a certain level

 For 11 days in February, violent rains punished <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> state, killing at least 198 people and leaving 11,000 homeless. <LOCATION> Petropolis </LOCATION>, a city of 300,000 in the mountains 40 miles north of the city of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, was the hardest hit. At least 167 people died there in mud avalanches and floods. Here is a report by an AP correspondent who was in <LOCATION> Petropolis </LOCATION> during the rains.

 <PERSON> Waldemar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> was the only bus driver to brave the winding mountain road up from <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> in a driving rain on Feb. 5 _ a Friday night. But he wanted to be with his family for dinner. It was to be his last. <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> almost did n't go. It had been raining hard since the previous Monday and there were no signs it would let up. <LOCATION> Petropolis </LOCATION> always gets rain during the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> summer, but this was twice as much as normal. Just after sunset, <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> climbed aboard the bus and began the route he had driven for 40 years. He was 64 now, getting close to retirement. At 11 p.m., <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> finally pulled into the <LOCATION> Petropolis </LOCATION> bus station, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, and the 60 passengers applauded. It was raining harder. A few minutes later, <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> dashed up the steps of his five-room, 70-year-old concrete house that was nestled piggyback on the side of a tree-covered hill on Casimiro de Abreu Street. His wife was waiting for him, along with his daughter, <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON>, her two children, and his daughter, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, and her husband, <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>. At 11:15 p.m., <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> sat down to dinner. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and her husband said good night and left for their own nearby house. It was the last time they would see each other. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> learned afterward that a concerned friend had called his father-in-law to see if all was well. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> said his father-in-law told the caller he thought he heard a strange, loud noise, then he hung up. It was 10 minutes to midnight. At that precise moment, two lovers in a <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> Beetle outside were exchanging a good-night kiss. Two houses away, preparations were under way for a Sweet 16 birthday party on Saturday. Relatives of the birthday girl had come all the way from neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Minas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gerais </ORGANIZATION> state to decorate the house and make snacks. In another house, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON> was putting her 9-year-old son <PERSON> Carlinhos </PERSON> to bed and was preparing to go to bed herself. Her mother, father and sister already were asleep. Then their world fell in. The noise <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> heard was a mudslide. It got louder as tons of water and wet earth raced down the slope and slammed into the houses on <LOCATION> Casimiro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abreu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> with such force that their concrete shells seemed to explode. The avalanche destroyed houses, cars and furniture, leaving only a slick-surfaced mass grave. Ms. <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON> ran outside as soon as she heard the noise. She looked up at the wall of mud looming above her and screamed. Then she, too, was buried in the reddish-brown slime. `` I heard an incredible noise, like an airplane taking off. I rushed to my gate in time to see electric wires exploding and power posts toppling at the end of the street,'' said <PERSON> Nair </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoelz </PERSON>, a longtime resident who lived nearby. `` People began screaming for neighbors along the hillside to turn on their car lights. Then all we could see was mud where eight homes had been.'' On Sunday, Feb. 9., rescue workers pulled Ms. <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON> and two neighbors alive from the mud-covered rubble where fallen beams had left enough space for pockets There were no other survivors on Casimiro de Abreu Street. `` I did n't have time to grab my son or even to think,'' Ms. <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON>, 42, said from her hospital bed. `` I'm a single mother. My son was my whole life. My joy came from watching him grow up.'' Over an eight-day period, rescue crews using tractors along <ORGANIZATION> Casimiro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abreu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> found soft-drink bottles, a mattress, bits of clothing, three crushed cars and 18 bodies. Among them were <PERSON> Waldemar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>, his wife, daughter, <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON>, and two grandchildren. `` He rushed home that night to die. It's like something that was meant to be,'' said son-in-law <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, 33. The mudslides destroyed more than 1,000 houses in <LOCATION> Petropolis </LOCATION>, from slum shacks to wealthy residences with swimming pools. Civil defense officials evacuated 94 areas in 28 neighborhoods and condemned 4,000 to 5,000 houses and apartments. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Eurico </PERSON> <PERSON> Aragao </PERSON>, an engineer who heads <LOCATION> Petropolis </LOCATION>' public works department, said bad planning and excessive logging were reasons behind the disaster. He estimated that 80 percent of the city's buildings were on unsafe ground and 50 percent of those that suffered damage unrecoverable. `` This city grew too quickly,'' he said. `` It was not well planned even when <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s former emperors built it in the 1800s.'' <LOCATION> Petropolis </LOCATION> grew from a sleepy royal summer getaway to a popular resort for the rich and also a `` dormitory community'' for poor inhabitants with jobs in and around <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. Many in town blamed three-term Mayor <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rattes </PERSON> for ignoring a 1978 environmental report that predicted just such a catastrophe from deforestation. City Hall also was accused of not making needed imporvements in drainage, shoring up hillsides and relocating the most dangerously situated homes, principally slum shacks. `` Basically this is a social problem, one of underdevelopment,'' <PERSON> Rattes </PERSON> said in an interview. Many people here earn the minimum wage, equal to just under $ 60 a month, and he said they `` build their houses however and wherever they can.'' The mayor estimated total damage at $ 50 million. Even while rescuers were searching for dead bodies, and it still was raining and more mudslides were occurring, many in <LOCATION> Petropolis </LOCATION> were reluctant to evacuate to government shelters. `` My husband was raised in this house,'' said <PERSON> Jurema </PERSON> <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>, 53, as she tearfully packed her few possessions and finally agreed to get out of her three-room mud-brick house. `` I have nowhere else to go and no way to build another house. This has been my life. How could I start again?'' she asked. Mrs. <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>, whose husband earns about $ 50 a month as a furniture maker, said she planned to return home as soon as the rains ended. But the city had condemned her street _ Enchantment Street, in <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> _ as one of the area's highest risk zones.

 The robbery and assault convictions of <PERSON> Wai-Chiu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>, the last of the defendants in the 1983 massacre of 13 people in a <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> gambling parlor, were upheld today by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The leader of the robbery-killings at <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fai </PERSON> <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mak </PERSON>, is facing the death penalty and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> was sentenced to life without possibility of parole in the killings, the deadliest mass murder in state history. The court was unanimous in upholding the 13 robbery counts and a single second-degree assault count against Ng, no relation to <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>. He faces seven consecutive life terms for seven of the robberies, with the six remaining robbery counts and the 10-year assault sentences running concurrently with the life terms. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> was charged with felony murder in all 13 deaths, but the prosecution did not seek the death penalty. He consistently denied he killed any of the victims and claimed he was forced by <PERSON> Mak </PERSON> under threat of death to participate in the robbery. He was convicted in <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 of the lesser charges. Twelve of the 13 victims at the <ORGANIZATION> Wah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> were tied and shot in the head execution-style to leave no witnesses. One victim, <PERSON> Wai </PERSON> <PERSON> Yok </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>, survived critical gunshot wounds to identify the assailants. <PERSON> Mak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> were arrested and tried separately. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>, whose family moved to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> when he was a youth, escaped. He was arrested for immigration violations about 18 months later in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He gave a confession to Canadian and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> police officers. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> sought reversal of his convictions, contending that his Canadian confession was wrongly admitted at trial. He also contended his convictions are inconsistent with his acquittal on the murder charges. But the court, in an opinion by Justice <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brachtenbach </PERSON>, rejected both contentions. The court said that <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>'s confession was voluntary and if it was incorrectly admitted the action was harmless because there was ample other evidence. `` Where the jury's verdict is supported by sufficient evidence from which it could rationally find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, we will not reverse on grounds the guilty verdict is inconsistent with acquittal on another count,'' the court said.

 Here are some highlights of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 By reordering priorities so that we spend more on national security and less on wasteful or unnecessary federal programs, we have made freedom more secure around the world and have been able to negotiate with our adversaries from a position of strength. By pursuing market-oriented economic policies, we have uncorked the genie of American enterprise and created new businesses, more jobs, improved production, and widespread prosperity. And we have done all this without neglecting the poor, the elderly, the infirm, and the unfortunate among us.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 This budget does not fully reflect my priorities, nor, presumably, those of any particular member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But the goal of deficit reduction through spending reduction must be paramount. Abandoning the deficit reduction compromise would threaten our economic progress and burden future generations.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 I propose an increase of $ 656 million ... for discretionary programs of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Although state and local governments fund most educational activity, federal programs provide crucial aid for the poor, the handicapped, and the educationally disadvantaged. I have proposed reform of our overcentralized welfare system through state experimentation with innovative alternatives ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Ineffective programs to assist dislocated workers would be replaced by an expanded $ 1 billion worker readjustment program -LRB- WRAP -RRB- carefully designed to help those displaced from their jobs move quickly into new careers.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 I propose a continued increase in federally supported basic research aimed at longer-term improvements in the nation's productivity and global competitiveness I would provide $ 11.5 billion for space programs ... I also recommend $ 363 million in 1989 to initiate construction of the Superconducting Super Collider -LRB- SSC -RRB-, including $ 283 million for construction and $ 60 million for supporting research and development ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 I continue to urge enactment of an affordable self-financing insurance program through Medicare to protect families from economic devastation caused by catastrophic illness. To attack the scourge of AIDS, I propose $ 2 billion for additional research, education, and treatment in 1989 _ a 38 percent increase over the 1988 level ... Building upon the nation's pre-eminence in basic biomedical research, I seek a 5.1 percent increase for non-AIDS research at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 For expanded law enforcement ... I propose $ 4.5 billion _ an increase of 6 percent over 1988. For drug law enforcement, prevention, and treatment programs, I propose $ 3.9 billion in 1989, a 13 percent increase over the 1988 level. To relieve prison overcrowding and adequately house a growing inmate population, I would provide $ 437 million _ more than double the $ 202 million devoted to federal prison construction in 1988.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 For the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to continue its multiyear program to modernize the nation's air traffic control systems, I would provide $ 1.6 billion _ a 44 percent increase over the level of 1988.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 To carry out the joint recommendations of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian special envoys on acid rain, I recommend total funding of $ 2.5 billion for innovative clean coal technology demonstration projects over the period 1988 through 1992. I also recommend an expansion of hazardous waste cleanup efforts, with an increase in Superfund outlays of some $ 430 million in 1989. To continue filling the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- SPR -RRB- at the current rate of 50,000 barrels per day, I would provide $ 334 million in 1989. Contingent upon the enactment of legislation authorizing the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserves -LRB- NPR -RRB-, I would provide an additional $ 477 million to bring the fill rate up to 100,000 barrels per day ... To improve the speed and accuracy of tax processing and expand information services provided to taxpayers, I would provide a $ 241 million increase for the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ...

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today he wants `` to rescue'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, abducted while working for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but officials said the president was referring to a multinational, diplomatic effort. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was queried, during a photo session on the budget with congressional leaders, about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to find <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. `` We're doing everything we can,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded. `` We're trying to find out as much as we can We're trying to get him located, and certainly we want to rescue him.'' Asked what such a rescue would entail, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` I think the president is making a reference there to all of our efforts to stay in touch with parties in the region, with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, to explore every possibility, to see if Colonel <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> can be safely returned.'' There has been no mention by officials at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> or White House of any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action to rescue <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. Instead, officials repeatedly have emphasized that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> authority and control. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> denied assertions by the group claiming responsiblity for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction that the Marine officer worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The spokesman said the group, the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, was not known to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. House Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>, also played down <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remark about a rescue. `` I think that was, maybe, just an off-the-cuff remark of the president,'' said <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, who was present when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said it. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said he always has been supportive of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> operations, but that his advice would be for American servicemen would be to keep out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, reaffirmed in strong terms, its determination to continue supplying <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, not just in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We do n't intend to let terrorists determine our policies or deter us from fulfilling our duties,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` It's an important mission; it's one we've been at for a long time; it's one that we share with a large number of other nations,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. He declined, however, to say if any new instructions would be sent to the remaining Americans. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was seized on Wednesday while traveling in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on official business as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> UNTSO </ORGANIZATION>. He and a number of other Americans _ the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said less than 20 _ are members of the <ORGANIZATION> UNTSO </ORGANIZATION> team assigned to keep the truce along the Israeli-Lebanese border. Since 1949, other <ORGANIZATION> UNTSO </ORGANIZATION> teams observe peacekeeping efforts along <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s borders with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction brings to nine the number of Americans seized in recent years in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> drew a distinction between <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> civilians _ who have been ordered out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> _ and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping efforts. Since the wave of kidnappings began, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been warning Americans to stay out of the country. Last year, after three more Americans were seized, use of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passport to travel to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was banned. `` In this particular case, the individual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officer was under the responsibility, authority and control of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in his role as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said he did not know if any special instructions were given to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel in light of the dangers, but added, `` as I say, these people are not under our operational control at all.'' Another <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the practice of the American military people observing the Israeli-Lebanese frontier was to stay at the border, but one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier _ <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in this particular case _ was permitted to travel further northward. `` This is not the case of a lone American straying off into a place he was n't supposed to be,'' said one official. `` He was assigned to a task; he was doing his job. There are a lot of people from many countries on these observer teams and it's dangerous for all of them.'' The official said three <ORGANIZATION> UNTSO </ORGANIZATION> members, none of them American, have been killed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1982.

<HEAD>Stroke Rate Falls but Disease Still Nation's No. 3 Killer</HEAD>

 The death rate from strokes is falling about 6 percent annually, but the disease will still cost Americans nearly $ 13 billion this year, according to a medical report released Thursday. Despite its declining mortality rate, stroke remains the third-leading cause of death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after heart disease and cancer. A report released by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> showed that stroke also continues to be a major financial burden. This year, the association estimates that $ 9.2 billion will be spent on hospital and nursing home care alone for stroke victims, who are often left paralyzed by their disease. When doctor and nurse bills, medicine and lost productivity are added, the total annual cost of strokes in 1988 will be an estimated $ 12.9 billion. In 1985, the last year for which statistics are available, about 500,000 Americans suffered strokes; 152,700 of them died. About a third of all survivors need help caring for themselves. Not all the statistics are bad, however. The decline in the stroke death rate has been picking up speed in recent years. `` The death rate is falling very dramatically,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. For the past four decades, the death rate from stroke has been dropping at a rate of about 1 percent a year. But since 1973, that decline has averaged 5.7 percent a year. No one knows precisely why this cause of death is becoming less common. However, the risk of heart attacks is also going down, and many experts believe the same factors are involved in curbing both diseases. `` A lot of people think the control of blood pressure, changes in lifestyles, changes in diet, more exercise and more health consciousness are affecting vascular -LRB- blood vessel -RRB- disease in general,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and chairman of the heart association's stroke council. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, who is also an epidemiologist at the long-running Framingham Heart Study, said that control of blood pressure appears to be the single most important of these factors. He noted that when even mildly elevated blood pressure is brought down through drugs and behavior changes, people's risk of stroke is cut in half. A stroke occurs when the blood supply in the brain is disrupted. Often a blood clot chokes off an artery, starving brain cells of oxygen. Strokes also occur when blood vessels burst and flood brain tissue with blood. Traditionally, doctors have been able to do little for patients except send them to hospitals, where they are taught to live with their disabilities. However, that is beginning to change, <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said. `` A lot of us are hoping that new technology, used in patients who are diagnosed correctly, may do a lot to help patients get better,'' he said in an interview. <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said that new diagnostic machines are becoming available that can help doctors pinpoint precisely where inside the head the blood vessels are in danger of clogging or breaking. Strokes may then be prevented with surgery or treatment. Doctors also are experimenting with drugs that may minimize the damage of strokes once they occur. `` Most people have treated stroke casually,'' said <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>. `` They say there's nothing you can do but rehabilitate the patient. The excitement is that we are starting to have the technology and ability to do something.'' However, he said that most of the new tools and expertise are now available only at large medical centers. He recommended that stroke patients be sent to the big hospitals for diagnosis.

 Former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> on Thursday became the first Democrat to quit the presidential race in 1988, declaring an end to an underdog candidacy that he called `` the greatest joy of my entire public life.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> told a roomful of family, supporters and reporters that he is abandoning the race in the wake of dismal showings in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> but he is not abandoning his cause _ `` an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that comes to grips with its future.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said he will not yet endorse any of the six remaining Democratic contenders. `` They are all first-rate people and I could support any one of them,'' he said. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, whose campaign was centered around economic themes including a frank call for a national sales tax, said the Democrats must `` give our country a compelling reason to elect us to power.'' `` I'm going to wait and watch and do everything I can to insure the success of our party,'' he said. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> finished fifth in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last week and sixth in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> on Tuesday. He seemed relaxed and even upbeat as he explained that probably `` a thousand things'' went wrong for his campaign. Ultimately, he likened his race to a stranger riding into town for a Fourth of July party and telling everyone that the party is over and it's time to rebuild the town. `` It's asking an awful lot in the course of a campaign before the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, to say, consider both a new messenger and a challenging and different message,'' he said. Throughout his news conference, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> displayed the self-deprecating wit he has carried through the campaign that he launched last March 10. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> joked that his appearance on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s comedy show, `` Saturday Night Live,'' was `` undoubtedly the high point of this campaign.'' Asked if he was worried about the nation's future if taxes are not increased to reduce the huge budget deficit, he quipped, `` Look, I'm not going to slash my throat if we do n't raise taxes tomorrow.'' And he said one friend told him, `` You fought a good fight, you were in it right up to the beginning.'' `` I do n't know why we fared no better. I'll leave that for others to ponder,'' he said. As his wife <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON> and two young sons looked on, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said, `` This campaign has been the hardest work and greatest joy of my entire public life. I'll not forget any of it.'' Hinting at a possible future candidacy, he added: `` I ca n't say I'd rush to do it again, but I might.'' Indeed, die-hard <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> admirers at his campaign office in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, answered the phone `` <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> in'92.'' He recalled the occasions during his campaign when he asked people to stand up if they supported his call for candor, especially his plan to tackle the federal deficit with a national sales tax. `` I'll never forget the people in audience after audience who stood up out of their chair to join me in a demonstration of belief for the politics of truth,'' he said. Asked if he would consider the vice-presidential spot, he quipped, `` My advice to the nominee would be ... ` You probably ought to select a vice-presidential candidate from a state with more than seven electoral votes.''' He added that if reincarnated he would try to be from the neighboring delegate-rich state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Referring to the generally favorable press coverage he received, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> jokingly accused reporters of `` a deliberate conspiracy to destroy my candidacy by making me into kind of a house pet ... to destroy my credibility with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> was the subject of many favorable articles, often focusing on the substance of his economic proposals, his willingness to risk the unpopular tax-increase message, and his generally unpretentious style. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> had hoped to get at least 10 percent but he garnered only 5 percent, ahead of only former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> urged him to stay in the contest when the two spoke Tuesday night, and told him, `` You've got something to say. You're a courageous guy,'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> related. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s staff said the campaign has about $ 150,000 to $ 200,000 in bills to pay off. His announcement Thursday concluded a campaign that used often non-traditional attention-getters _ his bicycle ride across <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, an ascent of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and a rugged cross-country ski tour in northern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. He said his immediate plans include a trip to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with his family and doing fix-up work around his <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> home. Asked how he will now earn a living, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> smiled broadly and cocked his head toward his attorney wife, saying, `` <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON>?''

 A few well-earned wrinkles adorn the cover-girl's face on <ORGANIZATION> Lear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, a stylish new magazine that celebrates `` the woman who was n't born yesterday.'' `` I feel a kind of earthquake of women over 40 who are going to change life for themselves for the better,'' said publisher <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>, 64, whose magazine hits the newsstands Tuesday. `` It's going to be a greater movement than the women's movement.'' For members of this new movement, <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>, the former wife of television producer <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>, blends a dash of fashion with no-nonsense financial advice and some savvy writing. `` Once upon a time,'' says her first editorial, `` a woman took the events of her life, added the pluses and deducted the minuses, and lived with that arithmetic. No more.'' <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>, a longtime supporter of women's causes, knows all about change _ and about bouncing back. Divorced after a 28-year marriage to <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>, she left <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for her hometown, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, carrying two suitcases of clothes and the germ of an idea. `` I could never look like <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> confides in a letter to potential subscribers. `` The women's magazines were urging me to travel, but every resort showed pictures of slim young women in bikinis.'' What was needed, she decided, was a magazine for women like her: educated, affluent and over 40. `` It took a woman to see it,'' she said. Armed with the dream, connections and money, but lacking know-how, she spent 2 -LCB- years picking the brains of the publishing world. `` The last person I spoke to was -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> creator -RRB- <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Felker </PERSON>, who said, ` Do it. Just do it.' And I did,'' she said. `` I was ecstatic that I would be writing and working for women, about whom I care a great deal.'' During the late 1960s, <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> founded <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Place </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> consulting firm. She later began <ORGANIZATION> Lear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purvis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an executive search firm for women. In 1984, as a partner in a political consulting firm, she founded a division for women candidates. The magazine, she said, `` is a fusion of my experience and the women I've worked with for the past 25 years, who ranged from welfare mothers to highly skilled executives.'' It's the female executives _ or wives of executives _ who make up <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>'s guaranteed circulation of 200,000. -LRB- The first issue, which ran 475,000 copies, was expected to sell out. -RRB- Market research shows the subscribers' average household income is $ 92,400. <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>, in fact, is using her own money to start the magazine. `` By the time it's in the black -LRB- she hopes in two to three years -RRB-, I will have spent $ 25 million,'' she said. Six issues are planned for this year and 10 for the second year. The ads and richly colored, high-fashion spreads feature over-40 models whenever possible. -LRB- They're in scarce supply. -RRB- `` We believe that <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>'s will spark a whole culture,'' she said. `` Products, instruction, entertainment, recreation _ this whole market will have their own world of toys to choose from.'' The copy ranges from humor, essays and fiction to advice on treasury bills and an interview with <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who defends her feminine style in the political arena. `` We have presented women over 40 who are absolutely beautiful and sensual and intelligent and character-ful,'' said <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>. `` It informs, it entertains, it impels, inspires.'' The feminism is soft-pedaled. `` The militant views of the early feminists are long gone, and feminism is settling into a more middle-of-the-road posture,'' she said. `` But the word ` feminist' still conjures up witches in some minds. Profiles mention the potholes on a woman's road to success: difficult upbringing, multiple divorces, adjustment to the aging process. Good marriages also get a mention. `` It is noteworthy to have a happy marriage. ... I think all women are basically traditional, and want love and home and family,'' said <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>. `` And a divorce is a major event in a person's life To leave it out would be to leave out one's education.'' <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> said 17 percent of her readers are under 30. `` They say, ` We want to know what it's like to be 40.''' `` I believe the second half of one's life is meant to be better than the first half,'' she said. `` The first half is finding out how you do it. And the second half is enjoying it.''

 A judge has denied a newspaper story that accused him of approving a large attorney's fee for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal figure <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> after asking <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to lobby for his federal judgeship. The story in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> said former <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and his partner a $ 1 million fee in September 1981, during the period the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was considering <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>'s appointment to the federal bench. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> was appointed a federal judge in January 1982. `` The article is misleading in at least one vital respect and should be corrected,'' said <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> in a statement Wednesday. `` Contrary to the story's implication,'' wrote <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, `` it is a matter of public record ... that I did not finally approve the attorneys' fees that were the focus of the story. Rather, in an order dated Dec. 24, 1981, I deferred determination of the amount and a different judge ultimately dealt with the matter and approved fees.'' The judge added: `` I reiterate that in my 16 years on the bench I have never been improperly influenced in any decision by any of my many professional or social relationships with members of the bar. `` Finally, I know of nothing that was improper or unusual about the process of my appointment to the federal bench.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutter </PERSON>, the Chronicle's assistant managing editor-metro, said today, `` I think if you read our story carefully it answers all the questions, and we stand by our story.'' The Chronicle story <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, in an interview with the paper, acknowledged seeking help from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> for the federal court appointment and that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was a friend of long standing. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was indicted last month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on charges of influence peddling for allegedly taking payments from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a defense contract in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, to lobby <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> before he became attorney general to get the company government contracts.

The Kremlin chief, who was responsible for agriculture before becoming party general secretary, frequently has consulted with <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON> on farm policy. <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON> also holds the powerful post of secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in charge of appointing party personnel as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> is a deputy chairman of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> and is on the panel's Presidium. He was named earlier this month to be chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which plays a key role in the country's centrally managed economy. As head of the committee, <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Talyzin </PERSON>, whose performance <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had criticized. The 58-year-old <PERSON> Talyzin </PERSON>, however, retained his candidate post on the Politburo on Thursday. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Talyzin </PERSON> was made head of the obscure <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> holds an engineering degree and has become a specialist in weapons, serving in a number of posts in the Soviet defense industry. He chairs the Presidium's <ORGANIZATION> Military-Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The Politburo, whose size varies, now has seven candidate members. No new voting members of the ruling body were appointed, leaving that number at 13. Removal of the towering 57-year-old <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> ends a tumultuous five months. He was one of the strongest advocates of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms but generated controversy because of a speech he gave at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s last plenary meeting, on Oct. 21 <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said reform was proceeding too slowly and attacked the party's style of leadership under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> He offered to resign. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was removed from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party leadership on Nov. 11, but a week later was named first deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, with the rank of government minister. Since then, his name has been mentioned in the press without references to his Politburo job, a sign he would be ousted. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> for being overly ambitious. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was quoted as saying: `` I am very guilty before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party organization, very guilty before the city party committee, and certainly I am very guilty before <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeyevich </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose prestige in our organization, in our country, and in the whole world is so high.'' Also Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baklanov </PERSON> as one of its secretaries. <PERSON> Baklanov </PERSON>, 55, was appointed minister of general machine building in 1983.

 The defense in the sedition trial of 14 men linked with white supremacist groups told a federal jury that a key witness for the government's case is a liar who had himself crowned king of the Ozarks. The charge came during opening statements Wednesday in which the prosecutor said that leaders of white supremacist groups gathered in 1983 to discuss poisoning the water supplies of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and establishing an Aryan nation. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, a defendant who is representing himself, told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury to expect `` a fairy tale of lies'' from the man he called the prosecution's star witness, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, who is serving a 20-year prison term for racketeering and weapons offenses, was leader of an Arkansas-based group named The Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord. <PERSON> Wayland </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, attorney for defendant <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> once went off into the woods, fasted and came out declaring that <PERSON> God </PERSON> had told him he was king of the Ozarks. `` This would be foolishness if they were n't trying to put innocent men in jail,'' <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> said, urging jurors to look for signs of untruthfulness when <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> testifies. Beam is among 10 men charged with conspiring to overthrow the government by force starting at a 1983 meeting attended by <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> and others. <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> said he never met <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> until that meeting and knows nothing of any conspiracy. `` It's a good story, but that's all it is,'' <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ardie </PERSON> <PERSON> McBrearty </PERSON>, 60, of <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, another of the 10 charged with conspiring to overthrow the government by force, echoed <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>'s statement in his own statement today `` By golly, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> could n't have done any better,'' in making up a story, he said. The government's tale, he said, consists of a `` little truth here, a little truth there, and a whole lot of imagination in between.'' He said he received about $ 100,000 from the founder of a white supremacist extremist group named The Order, but returned more than $ 90,000 after `` I began to sniff that these were n't tax fighters at all.'' He said he has long opposed some federal tax laws and procedures and had contact with some white supremacists only because they were introduced to him as tax protestors. Conspiracy to overthrow the government has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and four others are charged with conspiring to murder a judge and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who played a part in the prosecution of people who harbored a man wanted in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> for the slayings of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals. The maximum penalty for that charge is life imprisonment. One man, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, is charged with in both incidents. The government and five of the defendants made their opening statements Wednesday, the second day of a trial expected to last three months. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said in his statement that <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> talked about the poisoning scheme in 1983 at an Aryan Nations convocation in <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 69, is the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jesus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, while <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, 63, is a former <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> official convicted in 1973 in the bombing of empty school buses in <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. At the time, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> had more than 200 pounds of sodium cyanide in his possession, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said At that same conclave, supremacist leaders discussed the idea of abolishing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and setting up an Aryan state, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> `` sent a paper around to be signed,'' and when it came back signed by the leaders, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said, `` All of us today entered into a conspiracy against the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` The meeting ended with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> stiff-arm hail victory salute,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, Miles and <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> disputed this account. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> is trying to shorten his prison stay `` by saying anything the government wants him to say.'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said the supremacists viewed white people as the people of God, Jews as `` the spawn of Satan,'' `` blacks were called mud-people'' and were regarded as sub-human, and the government was called ZOG, for Zionist Occupation Government.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on Thursday approved a resolution accusing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of `` murderous acts of state-sponsored terrorism'' for the bombing last year of a South Korean jetliner that killed 115 people aboard. The Foreign Affairs Committee, which passed the resolution without dissent, also urged other nations to impose a trade embargo on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The resolution was sent to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with strong statements of bipartisan support. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON>, R-Calif., said the destruction of <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 858 last November `` was probably the clearest example we have seen of state-sponsored terrorism. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, called the bombing a monstrous act that raises doubt about the sanity of the heavily-armed North Korean regime bordering U.S.-allied <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The resolution said that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` categorically rejects the December 1987 proposal to enter into a dialogue with the Parliament of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, since its members represent a government that engages in murderous acts of state-supported terrorism.'' Prior to the bombing, Soviet diplomats had discussed a proposal for talks between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and North Korean lawmakers. The discussions were later proposed in formal letters relayed by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in December, according to a congressional staffer, who requested anonymity. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` fairly persuasive'' independent evidence of North Korean responsibility for the time-bombing. In addition, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyun-hee </PERSON>, surviving member of the two accused North Korean agents, confessed to South Korean investigators. The two left Flight 868 at <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, its last stop before the bombing over the <LOCATION> Andaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, and took cyanide pills when later arrested in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. The resolution expressed support for steps taken by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration after the bombing, including the addition of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to its list of countries supporting international terrorism. The resolution asked for sanctions and other measures against <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from `` other countries, particularly with close relations with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> ...'' This was considered a reference to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s closest neighbors.

<TEXT>
 Former Prime Minister <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON> is playing fairy godfather to a children's hospital in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> by trying to change the law so it can keep earning royalties from the classic tale, `` Peter Pan.'' Author J.M. <PERSON> Barrie </PERSON> bequeathed royalties from the book, stage and film performances about the boy who would n't grow up to the world-renowned <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ormond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for Sick Children. But the copyright expired Dec. 31 after the maximum 50 years permitted by law, just as the 146-year-old hospital launched a drive to raise $ 52 million for renovations. <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader who was prime minister from 1976-79, said Thursday he believes an exception should be made, and he will seek to change the law to make Barrie's bequest permanent. He said the initiative actually came from his wife, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON>, chairwoman of the special trustees who administer funds bequeathed to the hospital. <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON> _ now <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON> after being made a life peer by <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> last year _ said the hospital received a `` substantial'' amount of money from `` Peter Pan'' royalties. He could n't say how much because <PERSON> Barrie </PERSON> stipulated in his will that the sum should never be revealed. British media have speculated it was as much as much as $ 875,000 a year. <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON> said he hopes to introduce an amendment to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act next month that would enable the hospital to receive royalties forever. `` It -LRB- the amendment -RRB- is in train,'' he said. `` Proposals have been put forward. Everybody has been very helpful.'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON>'s proposal has the support of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government. <PERSON> Callagahn </PERSON> was defeated by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservatives in 1979. <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON> said there is a precendent for a perpetual copyright. Parliament granted one to <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for the Earl of <PERSON> Clarendon </PERSON>'s 1702 book `` History of the Rebellion'' about <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s rebellion and civil wars. <PERSON> Clarendon </PERSON>'s royalties were once very profitable to the university. In his honor, the <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> named the building it moved to in 1829 The <ORGANIZATION> Clarendon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barrie </PERSON>'s story about a boy who flew with Tinkerbell through never-never land and triumphed over Captain <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> grew out of tales he spun for five orphaned boys he took under his wing. The play was first performed in 1904, followed by a story, `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON> In <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>,'' in 1906 and the play in book form in 1911. The play is att $ acting full houses at the <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>. The royalties helped <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ormond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> develop a world-class reputation. Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> had his appendix removed there as a child.

 One year after jumping bail and failing to appear in court for a trial on sexual-assault charges, a former high school honor student remains on the lam, pursued by a bounty hunter, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and police. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, now 20, of <LOCATION> Darien </LOCATION>, has been missing since he and his parents parted at <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Feb. 15, 1987. He had been working in <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and he and his parents had booked separate flights to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, authorities said. Four days later, he failed to appear in court in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> for the start of his trial on charges that he raped two teen-age girls in 1986. `` We've had a lot of rumors, but as far as I know, the trail is cold,'' Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudock </PERSON> said. `` I personally have at least another 10 years on this job, so I'm patient. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, declined to discuss their son's case or his disappearance. They may lose their $ 450,000 home in this well-to-do suburb of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> because they put it up as security for <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s $ 200,000 bond, raised to $ 450,000 when he failed to appear Prosecutors have filed a foreclosure motion that is pending. Bounty hunter <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> entered the case last year after Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> authorized a $ 20,000 reward. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who usually works for bail bondsmen, said recently that he has uncovered some leads by talking to <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s friends and checking places where he was last seen. He declined to describe the leads, but he said he expects <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> to be arrested in less than a year. `` He's going to make a mistake,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` People who stay out that long feel no one is looking for them.'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> is charged with three counts of first-degree sexual assault, two counts of kidnapping and two counts of threatening in connection with the attacks on Feb. 10 and 14, 1986. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was arrested the day of the second assault, only days after his <ORGANIZATION> Darien </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> wrestling coach wrote an article in the weekly <PERSON> Darien </PERSON> <PERSON> News-Review </PERSON> describing in glowing terms how the teen-ager had overcome a troubled past. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> had been charged with nine burglaries in 1983 and 1984, and was sentenced to a four-month drug treatment program. Coach <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouvier </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> had returned to school in the spring of 1985 after completing the drug program, was earning As and had applied to colleges in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. `` He is open about his ` problem' and speaks candidly to groups of freshmen about drugs and their potential to ruin a life,'' <PERSON> Bouvier </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, said he thinks his client jumped bail because he feared he would not receive a fair trial after a judge decided to try the two assault cases together. `` It's very easy for the state's attorney to be very macho about it, but you're still looking at a 19-year-old kid -LRB- at the time -RRB- who is afraid and who is facing 20 years in prison,'' <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said. He was referring to a sentence proposed by prosecutors under a plea bargain agreement. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s parents have said they do n't know where he is, but police are suspicious. The assault victims were initially apprehensive about the trial, <PERSON> Hudock </PERSON> said, but <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s disappearance has left them angry. `` I would say their feelings go to the area of justice not having been served,'' he said. `` Their interest seems to have increased in the past year.''

<HEAD>Crimes Against Blacks, Jews Up In Los Angeles County During 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hate crimes directed primarily at blacks and Jews rose to an eight-year record in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area during 1987, according to a study that linked the increase to white power groups such as young neo-Nazi `` Skinheads.'' A study released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> cited `` entrenched racial and religious bigotry among a small segment'' of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> population as a reason for the increase. The study recorded 184 incidents of racially or religiously motivated vandalism and violence last year, the highest number since the commission began keeping statistics in 1980. They included 79 incidents of racially motivated crimes, compared to 58 in 1986. Anti-religious crimes totaled 115, up from 95 incidents in 1986. More than half of the racially motivated crimes were aimed at blacks and 85 percent of all anti-religious crimes were directed toward Jews, the study found. `` Our numbers for 1987 are the highest we've ever had, and we do n't think it's a result of improved reporting. It's real,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mornell </PERSON>, the commission's executive director. `` We also think there is an under-count of incidents, particularly for Latinos and Asians,'' he said. The report acknowledged increases in open hate-group activity by the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members and sympathizers, including the rise of `` Skinheads,'' youths who usually shave their heads as a symbol of their white supremacy beliefs. Graffiti was the most common harassment but the commission documented cross burnings, arson, gunshots and other forms of violence and vandalism. The study's findings were similar to a survey by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith which found anti-Semitic violence is on the rise in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and attributed the rise in part to the prevalance of `` Skinheads.'' The annual report for the first time logged 52 cases of harassment against gays and lesbians, out of 107 cases submitted to the commission in 1987 by the Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1989 budget would raise spending on general science by 20 percent, to $ 13.1 billion, and provide for machines to probe the outer space above <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and the inner space of particles on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The budget boosts spending for science and research programs by $ 2.2 billion, and includes start-up funds for the superconducting super collider in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> and the space station in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The spending plan also provides money to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> to establish 10 to 15 new basic science research centers over the next five years. About $ 400 million in the budget would go to the Energy Department for the start of construction on history's largest pure science machine, the superconducting super collider. This device, which would include an underground tunnel more than 50 miles long, would be the world's most powerful proton collider. Its goal is fundamental research into the basic nature of particles smaller than the atom. A number of states are competing for the super collider, but the final decision on the site has not been made. Energy's science budget authority for 1989 would total $ 1.2 billion, a 49 percent increase over the 1988 level. Most of the increase would go to the collider. At a briefing on the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> budget, space agency Administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said the president's budget follows a policy that `` clearly commits the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to space leadership as a fundamental objective'' and establishes for the first time a long-range goal of putting astronauts on other planets. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget outlay would increase by nearly 30 percent, from $ 8.4 billion in 1988 to $ 10.1 billion in 1989. Almost $ 1 billion of the outlay would go for start-up construction of the space station, a permanent orbital base that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans to have in operation in the mid-1990s. Space agency officials had hoped for another $ 800 million, but the project has been resisted by some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The space budget also includes start-up funds for the Pathfinder Project, a research program designed to develop the basic technologies needed to send astronauts to Mars sometime in the next century. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> also would receive more than $ 1 billion additional in its space flight budget in 1989. This will cover the additional costs of space shuttle missions. The agency hopes to complete recovery from the 1986 Challenger accident with the resumption of shuttle flights in August and a gradual increase in mission rate in 1989. The funding also covers the cost of building a new shuttle spacecraft, expected to be completed now in 1991. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> outlay would increase from $ 1.67 billion in 1988 to $ 1.81 billion in 1989. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called for a $ 300 million increase in basic research funded by the foundation. The budget proposes to establish 10 to 15 basic science research centers over the next five years. These centers would focus on research among a number of scientific disciplines and encourage industry participation, the administration said.

 <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was sworn in as the nation's <ORGANIZATION> 104th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice today, bringing a crucial tie-breaking vote to a court hampered by a vacancy the past eight months. With a hand on his family Bible, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> promised during a brief ceremony to `` do equal right to the poor and to the rich.'' He then was seated at the high court bench, at the place traditionally reserved for the junior justice. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who appointed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, did not attend the courtroom ceremony but Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s commission of office to the justices. None of the three former court members still living attended the ceremony. Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> succeeds, and Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> were in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Former Justice <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, whose wife died Saturday, also did not attend. In comments before the ceremony, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 51, said he had a running start in his new job. `` I've been working. I'm ready for Monday,'' when the court ends its current recess, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said while posing for cameras outside the court building prior to his swearing-in. `` We're just delighted to be in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The welcome has been very gracious,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. Surrounded by his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, three children and more than 30 other relatives, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he plans to live in an apartment in the nation's capital while he and his wife look for a permanent home. `` It's not quite big enough for the whole family,'' he joked before walking off with his relatives. The former federal appellate judge from <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, had two swearing-in ceremonies today: one in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ornate courtroom and the other at the White House. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s third choice for the job, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was confirmed by a 97-0 vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 15 days ago _ a tranquil conclusion to the political storm sparked by Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s retirement last June 26. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected the president's first choice, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. A second nominee, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, withdrew after admitting he had smoked marijuana while a law professor. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, although a conservative for his 12 years on the federal bench, is considered more of a moderate than either <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> or <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>. Little is known about <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s specific views on abortion regulation, affirmative action, church-state relations or the other politically sensitive issues on which the high court is closely divided. He is the third <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointee to join the court, following Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also elevated <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> to the chief justice's post when <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> retired in 1986 A busy schedule awaits <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The court, returning from a four-week recess, convenes in an all-day conference behind closed doors Friday and returns to the bench Monday to begin three days of oral argument sessions. One of the arguments focuses on whether private clubs may exclude women and racial minorities as members. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was criticized during his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings for his past membership in such exclusive clubs. The absence of a ninth justice for more than half the court's 1987-88 term has resulted in some significant deadlocks For example, the court split 4-4 in December when deciding whether a state may require some teen-agers seeking abortions to wait 24 hours after telling their parents or a judge about their decision. The justices also split 4-4 last month over the validity of an affirmative action program designed to promote more blacks and Hispanics in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Such votes automatically uphold the lower court's ruling but set no national precedent. The addition of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> reduces the court's average age from 68 to 66, and marks the first time in history the court has included three Catholics. Like <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, Justices <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. The court also includes three <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduates and four <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law school grads. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who received his undergraduate degree from <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> and his law degree from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, joins fellow <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> grads <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. The three other justices who have <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> law degrees are <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was shut down Thursday in a 24-hour strike by air traffic controllers and other workers seeking bonuses for dangerous or stress-filled jobs. A labor union spokesman said more than 70,000 workers had joined the walkout, including airport, railroad, and harbor workers and state hospital and veterinary employees. More than 40 international and domestic flights had been canceled and that Greek airspace would be closed `` for the day,'' an airport spokesman said. Olympic Airways, the Greek state carrier, was scheduling extra flights for Friday and that international flights would resume `` early in the morning,'' he said. `` We want extra money for stressful and dangerous jobs to be built into our pay scales, and also the right to get an earlier pension,'' said an airport union spokesman, who requested anonymity in accordance with Greek practice. State hospital doctors also staged a separate walkout to press their demands for a 30 percent salary increase. Most state-employed doctors currently earn less than $ 1,000 monthly. A union spokesman said hospitals would accept only emergency cases.

<HEAD>Operating Rate Remains Unchanged At 82.2 Percent In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's industrial operating rate was unchanged in January at 82.2 percent of capacity as cutbacks in the production of steel and autos offset gains in other areas, the government reported Thursday. The January operating rate remained at the highest level in almost eight years, but it was the first month since September that the operating rate had failed to move up. Many private economists believe the economy, which moved ahead at a robust pace during the second half of 1987, has entered a signficant slowdown brought on by high backlogs of unsold products which will cause cutbacks in production. While some believe the slowdown will be so severe that the country will enter a recession, most analysts are forecasting weak growth but no recession in the first half of 1988 followed by rising economic activity for the rest of the year. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product to rise a miniscule 1.4 percent this year, down sharply from the 3.8 percent growth recorded in 1987 with the weakness coming from production cutbacks brought on by sluggish consumer demand. By contrast, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, in releasing its 1989 budget Thursday, forecast economic growth of 2.4 percent for this year. In January, the operating rate in the auto industry dropped by 1.2 percentage points to 76.7 percent of capacity. It was the third consecutive monthly decline after auto plants hit an operating rate of 82 percent in October. The report blamed `` excessive inventories'' on dealers' lots for the production cutbacks. Steel and other makers of primary metals, a sector closely tied to the auto industry, also saw a drop in operating rates, which fell to 89.6 percent of capacity last month, down from 91.2 percent in December. Analysts said they looked for this trend to continue and spread to other industries as retailers, caught with high inventories, slash orders. The January operating rate of 82.2 percent was a full 3 percentage points above the operating level 12 months ago, reflecting the boom the manufacturing sector has enjoyed from rising export sales. The administration is counting on the strength from record-high export levels to offset weakness in the consumer sector and keep the economy out of a recession this year. For all of manufacturing, the operating rate was unchanged at 82.4 percent of capacity in January. Manufacturers of durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, operated at 79.9 percent of capacity, a small decline from December, while manufacturers of non-durable goods operated at 86.1 percent of capacity. The industry with the highest operating rate is paper, where plants are operating at 96.5 percent of capacity, followed close behind by textiles, with an operating rate of 94.1 percent of capacity. Normally, when operating rates get above 85 percent, economists begin to worry about bottlenecks and rising prices. But analysts said that the expected slowdown in growth should help to constrain prices this year. `` If I were n't expecting a slowdown, I would be more worried about inflation,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. The mining industry, which has been hardhit by declines in oil prices, had a 0.3 percentage point drop in the operating rate to 80.2 percent of capacity in January. This was offset, however, by a 0.9 percentage point increase in the operating rate at utility companies, which rose to 81.6 percent in January. The big gain was attributed to unusually severe winter weather which boosted heating demands.

 Republicans view an emerging Democratic package of purely humanitarian aid for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels as `` pretty soft stuff,'' and will seek to bring their own aid package up for a vote next week, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader said Thursday. `` I would certainly hope that whatever ... the speaker brings up, that we'd be given an opportunity as a minority party to offer a substitute for whatever they propose,'' Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., told reporters He said `` the preliminary indications are such that it's going to be pretty soft stuff that wo n't get the job done. And if it's just that, of course we would want to make one more attempt at doing something more significant. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lost his bid in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote Feb. 4 for a $ 36.2 million aid package that included some $ 3.6 million for weapons and ammunition, along with additional millions for military logistical support. Democrats prevailed on that vote, 219-211, after the party's leadership promised wavering members that there would be a later opportunity to approve a package of Contra aid that included only food, clothing, medicine and shelter A group of interested Democrats, together with one or two Republicans who voted against the president's proposal, have been meeting daily for the past week to draft such an alternative. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that the package would continue aid at current rates _ about $ 1.8 million a month for the aid itself, and an undetermined additional amount for transportation of the goods _ but that many other difficult issues remained unresolved. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has invited White House officials and the Republican leadership to participate, but they have elected to stay aloof from the package. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> alluded to the difficulties Democrats were having in drawing up an aid package that could win majority support, and noted that the issue of how the goods are to be transported remains unresolved. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> is using airdrops to get materiel to the rebels, but that authority expires Feb. 29. Many Democrats want delivery authority shifted to some neutral international body such as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> or Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but such groups would be unlikely to agree to make deliveries so long as hostilities continue. Cease-fire talks between the rebels and the leftist Sandinista government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> are continuing in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. `` My feeling is, it has to be done, continue to be done, through the agency, it's the only meaningful way of getting it there,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are some undelivered military supplies from the original appropriation -LRB- which ended last year -RRB- that have not yet been delivered,'' he said. `` I would like to see that there still be that capability for the delivery of the balance of that material.''

<TEXT>
 An anencephalic baby kept on life-support systems to preserve his organs for transplant died this morning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and a 3-week-old boy too weak to undergo a second heart transplant died in a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> hospital. `` The anencephalic baby has been declared dead,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He refused to immediately say whether the boy's organs were in suitable condition for transplants. The unidentified boy, who was born with most of his brain missing, had been on a respirator at the hospital 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>. He was born Tuesday in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, she said. Most babies born with anencephaly die within days. Their healthy organs can be transplanted if organ damage is prevented by maintaining the infants on life-support. No cases of anencephalics being kept on life-support have been announced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, although <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, chief of <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>'s heart transplant program, last year suggested there have been such infants. At Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johnathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON> died Wednesday afternoon, still attached to the heart-lungs bypass machine on which doctors had placed him after surgery, said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, hospital spokeswoman. His parents, <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tabitha </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Beaver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, were with him. <PERSON> Johnathan </PERSON> received a new heart Monday. The left side of his own heart was underdeveloped at his birth Jan. 25. Doctors said the cause of death was failure of the donor heart. The organ had come from an infant close in age and size to <PERSON> Johnathan </PERSON>, who was 7.6 pounds at birth, Ms. <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said. `` It really is perplexing for the surgeons,'' she said. `` The match with the donor organ was very good. The surgery itself ... proceeded very well. But for some unknown reason, immediately after surgery, the heart began to weaken.'' <PERSON> Johnathan </PERSON> was placed on the bypass machine following the transplant in hopes the donor organ could rest and gain strength, Ms. <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said. Doctors on Monday gave him a 10 percent chance to survive, and he developed complications with his lungs and kidneys the next day. <PERSON> Johnathan </PERSON> never gained consciousness following the transplant, Ms. <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said. A second transplant was not considered because `` doctors felt his system could n't withstand another surgery,'' she said. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> had maintained the infant on life-support under guidelines developed last year after a woman pregnant with an anencephalic baby waged a nationwide campaign to find a hospital that would consent to keep her child on life-support until the organs could be donated. But that baby was stillborn. One of the hospital's 13 heart transplant patients under age 4 received the heart of an anencephalic baby, but the donor child was in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. An infant who received a heart transplant at <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> on Sunday remained in serious but stable condition. The boy was born with a fatal heart defect.

 A caller today claimed the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades kidnapped a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer and accused the officer of being a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent. The Arabic-speaking man, in a telephone call to a Western news agency, said the previously unknown group took Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> out of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> `` after he was brought out from the south.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials and Shiite Moslem militiamen staged a massive search for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> throughout south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and virtually sealed off the area around Tyre, 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he wants to rescue <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, but he offered no details. `` We're doing everything we can,'' he said at a photo session. `` We're trying to find out as much as we can. We're trying to get him located, and certainly we want to rescue him.'' But later, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` I think the president is making a reference there to all of our efforts to stay in touch with parties in the region, with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, to explore every possibility, to see if Colonel <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> can be safely returned.'' In <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 72, died of heart failure, said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazle </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION>. Gunmen on Wednesday blocked the coastal highway near Tyre and grabbed <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> as he returned from a meeting with officials of Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s Shiite Amal militia. <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, an Amal political leader, said he and <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> had discussed efforts to free foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, in addition to other topics at the Tyre meeting. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was serving as chief of an observer group attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue supplying soldiers for the observer group but declined to say if any new instructions would be sent to the Americans. The caller said: `` <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> has joined the hostages. He will only come out after he is tried on grounds that he is one of the directors of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is now out of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after he was brought out from the south.'' The caller said a written statement and a photograph of the captive will be issued soon. Then he hung up. There was no way to authenticate the claim immediately. The pro-Iranian groups Islamic Jihad, Islamic Jihad for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and Holy Warriors have claimed responsibility for kidnapping 23 of the other 24 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. No one has claimed responsibility for the disappearance of <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> helicopters took off at dawn to join the search for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> but were grounded early today by heavy rain. Troops of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, and the Amal militia, the dominant force in the region, searched together through the night. The militia teamed up with <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> to search for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, soon after he was kidnapped. `` We hope the kidnappers will have no chance of slipping out with their captive. That's why all exits have been blocked,'' an Amal spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Plainclothes militia security men in cars blocked roads along the <LOCATION> Litani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast 25 miles inland to the slopes of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION>. Uniformed militiamen armed with submachine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers patrolled a 12 -LCB- - mile stretch of the coast from the <LOCATION> Qassmieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> north of Tyre to the scene of the abduction `` Our men are searching villages in a 300-square-mile area north, east and south of Tyre,'' said <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s military commander in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops are blocking the southern exits.'' <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> met today with <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> commanders at the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Tyre barracks to coordinate the search He told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> as he went into the meeting, `` We're capable of confronting the people who've carried out the abduction if need be. But I hope a quick, happy ending will be accomplished.'' Security sources said French specialists were dispatched to Tyre from <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION> to interrogate an unidentified Lebanese bus driver who claimed he witnessed the abduction. `` The French have managed to draw a face sketch of the gunman the eyewitness says he saw pointing a pistol at <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' head as he forced him into the kidnappers' car,'' said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> has commanded the 76-member <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, since Jan. 8. The group, made up of officers from 16 countries, is attached to the 5,800-man <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, deployed in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1978 to police the border with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> operates in predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> areas whose population frequently have been caught in cross fire between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops on one hand and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas and Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremists on the other. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was the third <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official to be kidnapped in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in two weeks and the second American military officer ever abducted in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He became the 25th foreigner and ninth American held hostage there. The foreign hostage held longest in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

The first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officer kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, abducted by Palestinian guerrillas in 1974. He was freed the same year. The other foreign hostages include four Frenchmen, three Britons, two West Germans, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian, a Swede, a Norwegian and two unidentified men.

The Molpus-Dowdy battle, rated a toss-up in the most recent polls, has been waged mostly in the media. But in recent weeks, the two contenders have been criss-crossing the state, making brief campaign stops in a host of towns. Dowdy, 44, who gained his 4th Congressional District seat in a 1981 special election, has been stressing his experience in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>, 38, has been touting his record as director of federal-state programs under former Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> and as secretary of state since 1984. Dowdy, also a former mayor of <PERSON> McComb </PERSON> in southern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, was the first candidate to enter tha race after <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON> said he was retiring. `` It was a tough decision to give up my <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat,'' said Dowdy, adding he felt he could have a greater impact for his constituents in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>, a native of central <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, said he entered government in the first place to make `` <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> a better place to live'' and believes he `` can do that most effectively in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' A poll conducted Feb. 12-13 for a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> radio station showed Dowdy with the backing of 40.5 percent of the Democrats questioned, compared to 35.6 percent for <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>. Fountain, 47, who ran for governor last year and finished seventh in the eight-man field, had 2.5 percent, and 22 percent were undecided. The poll of 630 Democrats had a 4 percent margin of error. Another poll two weeks earlier for several state newspapers had <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON> leading 39 percent to 34 percent, with 2 percent for Fountain and 26 percent undecided. It surveyed 526 voters and a had 3.5 percent margin of error. Because Dowdy and <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON> differ little in their political philosophies, some groups have found it difficult choosing whom to endorse. The <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> gave Dowdy its backing, but said if <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON> wins the Democratic nomination, its endorsement will automatically go to him. The politically active <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educators </ORGANIZATION> endorsed both candidates and said it would support the primary winner. <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, 46, who has served eight terms in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, says he'll stress his own <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> experience when his campaign gets under way in earnest after the primary `` My role as whip in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has prepared me well, and certainly after 16 years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> I know my way around the halls of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION> resident said. The only other wide open fight for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in the last four decades came in 1978 when Sen. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, R-Miss., won a three-way fight for the seat that had been held since 1941 by the late Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON>, a Democrat and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> planter <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> became the state's first GOP senator in a century by picking up 45 percent of the vote in a battle that included Democrat <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Dantin </PERSON> and black independent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>. He won re-election in 1984 with 58 percent. <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>, the nation's oldest and most senior senator, won his seat in a special election in 1947, taking the place of longtime state powerbroker <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilbo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON> was a long-time Southern power broker in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, particularly on military matters and funding. First as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and then of Appropriations, he helped funnel millions in military projects and bases into the state. In addition, <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON> was a major proponent of the often-criticized Tennesse-Tombigbee Waterway which runs through the northeast part of the state. Some critics claimed the $ 2 billion, 234-mile project, completed in 1985, was a classic example of federal pork barrel politics. <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON> never faced a serious challenger until <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> left a political post in the White House to make the 1982 race. But <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>, then 81, raised a $ 1 million and ran a slick media campaign. He wound up carrying all but two of the state's 82 counties and beat <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> by a 64-to-36 percent margin.

<HEAD>Researchers: Unethical to Use Courts To Force Treatment of
Pregnant Women</HEAD>

 Physicians concerned for the unborn should not turn to the courts to force pregnant women to undergo Caesarean sections, drug abuse treatment or other procedures, two medical researchers argue. Such use of the legal system is unethical and could open the door to court interference in such personal decisions as whether a pregnant woman continues to work, the researchers said in an essay in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Judicial involvement inevitably invades a woman's privacy, entails the disclosure of confidential medical and personal information, and thrusts the woman into the adversarial system,'' wrote Dr. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. Once in that system, the woman `` must defend her choices on a highly personal matter at a time when she is psychologically and physically ill-disposed to do so,'' they said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Annas </PERSON>, a professor of health law at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that `` the mainstream now is to agree'' with the essay, though some specialists in infant care still favor court intervention. However, <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> said she and <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> wrote the essay out of concern over a survey last year indicating a significant number of gynecology department heads believed court intervention was acceptable to force pregnant women to accept treatment on behalf of fetuses. More harm than good results from making adversaries out of mother and fetus, said the essay, which supports a stand adopted in August by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetricians </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists. Over the long-term, not only would court interventions undermine the doctor-patient relationship, but they would necessitate an impossible task _ defining reliable standards for stepping in, the essay said. `` Forcing women to undergo medical treatment against their wills is too weighty a matter to be left to the vagaries of personal interpretation by physicians and judges,'' said the essay. The issue comes up most often in court-ordered Caesarean sections and forced transfusions to the fetus, <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Wednesday. `` The extension would be to seek out women for other behaviors,'' she said. `` That could be anything from smoking to continuing to work ... sexual activity, if contra-indicated, or of not following a recommended medical regimen.'' <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said: `` We recognize that the behavior of women who are abusers of alcohol or drugs poses significant potential for fetal harm. `` However, there are solid reasons to doubt that a system of legal punishment or intervention would decrease the incidence of this behavior, as it is usually an addiction over which these women have little control.''

<HEAD>Presidential Pardons Expected To Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal felons can take some heart from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1989 budget proposal. Presidential pardons and commutations are projected to rise dramatically this year and next. In 1987, there were only 23 pardons and no commutations of sentence. But the budget anticipates 50 pardons and five commutations in this fiscal year, which began last Oct. 1, and an additional 50 pardons and five more commutations in the 12 months beginning next Oct. 1. Pardon Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> was not immediately available for comment on the reasons increases are anticipated. Many political figures and legal observers have suggested <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may pardon some of his former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides who participated in the Iran-Contra affair and are expected to be indicted this year by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has refused to discuss such pardons and his aides have said such discussions are premature. By comparison, there were 55 pardons in 1986 and no commutations. Denials and requests for pardons or commutations not acted upon remained steady at 290 in both 1986 and 1987. There was no immediate explanation for the drop in pardons in 1987.

 Former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, on the heels of disappointing finishes in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, abandoned his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential bid today, saying `` today our campaign lowers its flag, but our crusade continues to march.'' <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> becomes the second Republican to quit the race, following the withdrawal of former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> last Friday. `` You have given me the opportunity of a lifetime,'' said du Pont. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> had hoped to make himself the conservative alternative to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> front-runners <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, but he finished far down in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> took note of his controversial stands on issues from mandatory drug testing for high school students to elimination of farm subsidies and said, `` We have moved those challenges forward to the center of the debate; they are urgent, they are real, they will not disappear.'' `` Neither will our efforts to address them. All of us can pause to catch our breath, none of us should think it time to end our quest,'' he told about a hundred supporters in his hometown. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who officially began his campaign 17 months ago, thanked his supporters. `` In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> we do not promise that everyone wins, only that everyone has the opportunity to try. You have given me the opportunity,'' he said. `` You listened, considered and chose. I could not have asked for more.'' The former two-term governor finished fourth in a field of five in Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, barely edging former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> won 10 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vote in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, netting him his first and only two delegates to the Republican national convention. He was never considered a front-runner, instead battling it out with second-tier candidates Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s conservative credentials were polished by his endorsement from Union Leader newspaper of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> N.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> declared his candidacy Sept. 16, 1986 _ 17 months before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary _ making him officially the first Republican in the field. His announcement came in a <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> hotel that bears the family name, one traced back through at least eight generations. During the announcement, the 53-year-old former congressman, state legislator and great-great grandson of the founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> admitted he was not a public figure despite his famous name. But, he said, `` I'm in a wonderful position. I'm unknown. I'm underrated, and there's nowhere to go but up. That same day, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> took off for <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, N.H. In an interview later that week with the <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> News-Journal, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said if he did not do well in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, he would pull out of the race. Being first to announce, he drew national attention, particularly for his provocative stands on several issues, including mandatory drug testing for all high school students, creation of a private alternative to Social Security modeled after <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> accounts, and the replacement of welfare with a mandatory jobs program. Now his political future is unknown. He's a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> graduate and an attorney with the <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> firm of <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, <PERSON> Layton </PERSON> and Finger, rated among the state's most prestigious firms handling corporate law cases. He can not run for governor again, having already served the maximum two terms. He has said one does not run for vice president.

 Babies whose parents receive a form of welfare in this southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> community wo n't be `` Pampered'' anymore. <PERSON> Selectmen </PERSON> have decided that residents who receive general assistance, a local form of welfare, can not use the money to purchase disposable diapers. `` Cloth diapers will be less expensive for the taxpayers,'' Chairwoman <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said disposable diapers can cost more than $ 10 a box, and some mothers buy up to four boxes each week.

She has been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> only about two years and speaks little English. But she and her benefactor, restaurateur <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Deletioglu </PERSON>, have won the hearts of <LOCATION> Woit </LOCATION> and other residents on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woit </PERSON>'s push-ups are part of a weeklong fund-raiser at the <ORGANIZATION> Lehmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> to raise $ 100,000 for a series of eye operations for <PERSON> Dilek </PERSON>, who was brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with her mother by <PERSON> Deletioglu </PERSON> in 1986. <PERSON> Deletioglu </PERSON>, 44, a native of <LOCATION> Antioch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, saw <PERSON> Dilek </PERSON>'s picture in a newspaper from his home country and decided to help her. `` I had never met her,'' he said, `` but one picture was worth a thousand words.'' For the past two years, <PERSON> Dilek </PERSON> and her mother, Guldane, have been living with <PERSON> Deletioglu </PERSON> and his family, as doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> work to open her eyes. Drs. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Putterman </PERSON> are donating their services, but hospital bills have mounted. `` It keeps going on and on,'' <PERSON> Deletioglu </PERSON> said. So he went to his fitness club to seek help in raising money. Members of the club, in return, went to other merchants in the community and put together a weeklong series of events that will wrap up with a party and raffle Friday night. Six weeks ago, <PERSON> Putterman </PERSON> began the first of several operations that, doctors say, could allow <PERSON> Dilek </PERSON> to see. He took lining from inside her mouth and used it to start forming an eyelid on the girl's right side, <PERSON> Sugar </PERSON> said. `` In about a month, we hope to reopen her lid and then attempt a cornea transplant,'' <PERSON> Sugar </PERSON> said in an interview Wednesday. `` Her condition is called cryptophthalmos, meaning hidden eyes, because her eyes are hidden.'' It's likely <PERSON> Dilek </PERSON> will need about six operations on her eyes, <PERSON> Sugar </PERSON> said. And she will probably never have normal vision. `` The likelihood is that her sight will be limited. Our best hope is that she'll be able to see enough to get around,'' <PERSON> Sugar </PERSON> said. `` If that fails, at least she can be fitted with a cosmetic shield to help her appearance.'' <PERSON> Deletioglu </PERSON> is known in the community for opening his restaurant to the homeless on Thanksgiving. `` I've known <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> a long time, and I know how charitable he is,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Najman </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Lehmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` When he told me about her problems, we volunteered to help.'' Woit raises money by taking on challengers in push-up contests. The club has pledged to donate $ 500 to <PERSON> Dilek </PERSON> for any challenger who beats him; the challenger who loses must contribute <PERSON> Woit </PERSON>'s victory margin in dollars. `` It's just something to help,'' <PERSON> Woit </PERSON> said. `` The important thing is what <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> is doing for this little girl. He's a giver.''

 Dozens of cars whizzed past a struggle between a mugger and a woman on the state's busiest highway, but no one stopped to help her, police said. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON>, 37, a saleswoman from <LOCATION> Germantown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, became stranded on the Schuylkill Expressway Tuesday night when she got a flat tire on her rental car. After waiting 40 minutes inside the car for someone to stop to help her, she was heartened to see a truck driver stop. The man was driving a flatbed truck, which he stopped about 300 yards away, she said. As he walked toward her car, she got out and started talking to him. `` He seemed very friendly and helpful,'' she said Wednesday. `` He said he had helped somebody else with a flat tire further back.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON> said the man then knocked her to the ground and tried to drag her over a concrete barrier. He finally fled with her purse when one motorist slowed and honked. `` I was screaming and fighting, but nobody stopped,'' Ms. <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON> said. `` I had one hand out, and I was trying to flag down cars. I was just waving frantically with the one arm and fighting and kicking with the other.'' Police estimated 40 to 50 vehicles passed by during the scuffle, which occurred about 8:15 p.m. `` Ten-to-one, a hundred people saw it,'' State Trooper <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. `` You're talking about a very heavily traveled section of the highway.'' Two anonymous callers reported the incident about 15 minutes afterward, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. By time police arrived, Ms. <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON> had returned to her car and had driven it about a mile on the flat tire, he said. The man escaped with a black leather pocketbook containing about $ 50, an airline ticket, credit cards and an appointment book, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON> suffered a bruised shin but did not require hospital treatment.

<TEXT>
 County health officials are calling for round-the-clock mobile psychiatric teams to help police handle disturbed people who may erupt into violence. The officials, in a report to the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, recommended placing psychiatric nurses and trained caseworkers at <ORGANIZATION> Parkland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> to be sent out as needed. `` Many emergency crises could be effectively interrupted if professionals were available seven days a week, 24 hours a day to be dispatched to the scene,'' their report said. Law enforcement, mental health and city officials have been looking for ways to improve treatment and avert violence by the mentally ill since Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> was killed last month by a disturbed homeless man who grabbed his gun. Police Chief <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> told mental health advocates Wednesday that the Jan. 23 shooting persuaded him to speak out on the need for better treatment. `` We need to help get these people off the street,'' <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said. `` If the mental health care had been better, he would n't have been out there.'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who died in an exchange of gunfire after he shot and killed <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> in downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, had been diagnosed 10 years earlier as a paranoid schizophrenic. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said that although he earlier laid blame for the shooting to an anti-police atmosphere created by department critics, he was unaware of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' history of mental illness at the time. Some witnesses said a few spectators urged <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to shoot the officer; others said they did not hear any such thing. County health officials' plan for the psychiatric unit won plaudits from council members, who said costs and coordination would have to be examined before a decision is made. `` This thing should have been pursued much earlier, before the Chase shooting,'' said Deputy Mayor Pro Tem <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON>. Mental health experts estimate that only a small fraction of the mentally ill may become dangerous. But <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said officers regularly deal with `` more than a few time bombs'' who need treatment. `` You're talking about not only a social problem but a tremendous waste of police resources'' in dealing with the mentally ill who commit crimes, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>State Endorses Experimental Sugar Cane Marsh to Save Everglades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state task force has endorsed a sugar grower's proposal to build an experimental marsh in a cane field to study ways to protect the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> from agricultural drainage. The <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Okeechobee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> agreed Wednesday to encourage the state to develop such plans, but suggested that a larger test site might be needed in the fields of S.N. Knight and Sons. `` We think it's a good idea and a good approach,'' said <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, council chairman. Knight offered to build four miniature swamps for the experiment if the state would extend the grower's lease on 3,700 acres of state-owned land in western <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The action came as the council completed its 50-page interim report to the Legislature on environmental problems created by diverting polluted water away from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION>. Much of the report focuses on problems in the sprawling sugar cane-growing region, the 700,000-acre Everglades Agricultural Area. The agricultural drainage is damaging the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> marshes in western <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> counties, and could pose a long-term threat to local water supplies, scientists have said. Council member <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION>'s utilities director, said the outcome of the experiments would be very important for protecting coastal communities' water supply. `` If we can enjoy success with the research into biological, vegetative methods of nutrient removal, we will all be very happy along the lower <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> said. The council recommended a series of experimental projects to test the ability of artificial marshes to absorb excess nutrients from farm drainage. It also recommended steps be taken to reduce nutrients discharged by lakefront communities' sewage treatment plants, and supported any improved farming practices to reduce agricultural discharges. The panel's recommendations go directly to the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, but will not require much legislative action. Most of the efforts can be carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> without legislative authorization.

<HEAD>Parents Remove Girl Stricken With AIDS From Kindergarten</HEAD>

 The parents of a 5-year-old girl stricken with AIDS have removed her from kindergarten just as community tensions over the girl's admission appeared to be waning. The girl's parents said they decided to withdraw their child from the <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> to give her more time to mature and give the community and school a chance to better prepare for children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, said Principal <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulton </PERSON>. The girl's removal wo n't stop efforts to educate parents and children about the lethal disease, Superintendent <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> said. `` We're obviously going to plow ahead, not only with parent information programs, but also with developing AIDS policies,'' he said. Enrollment of the unidentified girl last week had caused concern by some parents about the safety of their children despite assurances from health officials that AIDS is not spread by casual contact. Health officials have not said how the girl contracted the AIDS virus. Some parents kept their youngsters out of school earlier in ` the week as a protest. The number of absences fell from 97 on Tuesday to 42 on Wednesday as attendance returned to normal. School officials, complying with state law, refused to provide any details about the girl's identity or background. The girl had been examined by the <ORGANIZATION> Tulare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> and her personal physician and was deemed fit to attend public school. The girl attended class Feb. 8, but it was n't mandatory for her to start kindergarten this year.

 Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> dropped out of the presidential race today, both declaring their futile campaigns the opportunity of a lifetime, while most of the surviving contenders marched south for a campaign blitz leading up to Super Tuesday's primary trophy. Meanwhile, Republican party regulars in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> were bracing for <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s `` invisible army'' as they geared up for a non-binding straw poll tonight. And Democrats were set for back-to-back debates, starting tonight in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the biggest Super Tuesday state. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> became the first post-New Hampshire casualties. `` Today our campaign lowers its flag, but our crusade continues to march,'' <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said in his hometown of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del. `` In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> we do not promise that everyone wins, only that everyone has the opportunity to try. You have given me the opportunity. ... You listened, considered and chose. I could not have asked for more,'' said <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, heir to the chemical-company fortune. Both <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, former governor of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, former governor of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, said they would not endorse another candidate for now. Appearing at a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said he was reminded of the biblical saying, `` The truth shall set you free.'' In his case, he said, the truth _ his poor showings in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ `` came a lot sooner than I expected.'' Still, he said, `` Today I am free.'' `` Although I am withdrawing from this race, I am not withdrawing from the cause that brought me to it,'' he said. `` I do n't know why we fared no better; I'll leave that for others to ponder. But I am very proud of what we did achieve and I am honored beyond measure by the opportunity I was granted to take part in this campaign.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, who formally announced his candidacy on March 10, 1987, failed to set the electorate afire with his call for a national sales tax to combat the federal deficit, but received good press reviews for his candor and wry humor. He said today a friend had told him, `` <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, you fought a good fight. You were in it right up to the beginning.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who finished last among Democrats in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, headed home to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where he said his campaign would continue but not for reasons of `` ego and ambition.'' Financially strapped <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who placed second in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and third in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, backed off his declaration that he must win contests next week in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to stay in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. He told reporters at a series of fundraisers late Wednesday, `` We're now hedging on that because of the reaction we've been getting from around the country.'' <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> entered the Republican race on Sept. 16, 1986, and, along with Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sought to present himself as the conservative alternative to front-runners <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was campaigning in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> today, brushed aside complaints from <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> that he had misrepresented the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator's positions on taxes, an oil-import fee and arms control in a flood of commercials just before Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. `` I'm not going to dwell on it,'' the vice president said. `` I do n't want to be drawn into something like that. Keep it on a high plane.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and had hoped to deliver the knockout punch in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, promised to hit back if attacked again. Which he was _ by Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, who hit <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s record on taxes and Social Security. The Democrats' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> victor, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, hotfooted it South and took quick aim at Tennessean <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who has hinged his campaign on a strong showing on March 8, when all the Southern states but one hold primaries or caucuses. `` There's a mythology about the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> as if it's some kind of foreign country. It's nonsense,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who picked up endorsements Wednesday from former <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Layne </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Mayor Dutch Morial. Told that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had said his opponents were alienated from the voters, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor retorted: `` Mr. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, virtually left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. ... I do n't know who's alienated.'' Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who finished second in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, was campaigning in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, which holds a `` beauty contest'' primary on Tuesday in which voters state a preference that does not commit convention delegates. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> strategists said he wanted to head into Super Tuesday with a recent win under his belt. The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman also was campaigning in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, which holds caucuses March 5 with 13 delegates at stake. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who made respectable showings in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, was back in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> on a swing through <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. In Mobile, he stood with paper workers locked out in a contract dispute, sounding his campaign call for economic justice. The Democrats were gathering in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for the first of two debates. On Friday they move on to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, threatened to reignite the controversy he kicked off at a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> debate Sunday when he asserted that there are Soviet missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> _ a claim the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> quickly denied `` In my opinion they are there,'' the former television evangelist said as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Buena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had acknowledged after first making the claim that he had no direct evidence to back it up. In <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, where Republicans were holding a straw poll tonight, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state chairwoman <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitkus-McKinney </PERSON> said she had heard reports that backers of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> would try to pack the caucuses. Followers of the former television evangelist have flummoxed <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> regulars in several states with massive organizing drives. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wark </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> coordinator for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, said his organizing efforts were no different than those of coordinators for other candidates.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Seek Death Penalty For Nasser's Son in Shootings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAURICE GUINDI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's chief prosecutor said Thursday he will seek the death penalty for the son of the late President <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> and 10 other people charged in a series of shooting attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Israeli diplomats. Prosecutor General <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Guindi </PERSON> announced the indictment of 20 people in the shootings. <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>'s eldest son, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, and 10 other defendants will be tried for their lives by a high state security court. They are charged with murder, attempted murder and attempting to undermine <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s internal security and relationships with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The other nine, among them <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>'s nephew, <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawky </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, face prison sentences up to life. The indictment accuses them of complicity and covering up knowledge of criminal activity. <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, 38, is in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>'s nephew, a physician, is in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has no extradition treaty with either country, and <PERSON> El-Guindi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> will seek help from the international police agency <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> to catch them. The charges grew out of four attacks in four consecutive years on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> diplomats by gunmen in speeding cars. Two Israeli diplomats were killed and six others were wounded in shootings between 1984 and 1986. Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats were wounded in the last of the attacks in May 1987. All the attacks were followed by typewritten statements or telephone calls to foreign news service offices in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> claiming responsibility from a group calling itself <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution. The statements opposed <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s 1979 peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, attacked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, reflected pro-Libyan leanings and professed a pan-Arab Nasserite ideology. It was one of the key defendants who reportedly broke the case by contacting the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> with an offer to sell information about the group. Embassy officials interrogated him extensively, then handed him to <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> authorities, according to Egyptian press accounts. The indictment listed <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Cairo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, as the second defendant after <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON> el-Sayed <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Suliman </PERSON>, 47, a businessman and former administrator at the Egyptian Embassy in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It said the two and <PERSON> Suliman </PERSON>'s younger brother <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> founded <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution `` with the aim of committing murder ... and hostile acts'' against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It said <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Suliman </PERSON> participated in all four attacks and his brother <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> in some of them. In addition to helping form an illegal secret group, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> was accused of financing it and supplying other `` material aid'' including firearms, three hand grenades, bulletproof vests and disguise paraphernalia. He was not charged with participating in the shootings. `` Under the name <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution, these men assassinated and attempted to assassinate diplomats with the aim of destabilizing the security situation in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and spoiling relations between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and those countries,'' el-Guindi said in summing up the indictment to reporters. `` There was no intention to overthrow the government.'' The defendants included two former military officers and a former corporal. `` The financing came from abroad, but the investigation has not showed from where,'' el-Guindi said. The tone of statements from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Revolution and the alleged involvement of <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>'s son gave rise to speculation in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> that the money came from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, whose leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> is a self-proclaimed disciple of the late Egyptian president. The amounts of money the annex said went to finance the group, including monthly salaries to the defendants, totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars. <PERSON> El-Guindi </PERSON> refused comment on the reported involvement of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in breaking the case. One such report came from a leading Egyptian newspaper columnist, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahaa </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON>. He told foreign correspondents last November that <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Suliman </PERSON> approached <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats offering to sell information and that the Americans' investigation led to the Egyptians' solution of the case.

<HEAD>Brother Turns Down Leukemia Victim's Request For Marrow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Leukemia victim <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> says it may be best that his younger brother rejected his request to donate critically needed bone marrow for a transplant. The younger brother, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, 31, ran away from home 14 years ago and now lives on the streets of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, earning money as a test subject for medical experiments. `` He was a last resort for a match. Being on the streets that long, he could be sick or on dope,'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, 38, said Wednesday. `` There's no telling what he's got. Maybe it's better that he did n't agree.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, hospitalized at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, was urged by his physician to locate the brother because blood types from other relatives were not compatible for a marrow transplant. His wife, two teen-age children, a sister and another brother had all volunteered. `` I just had a feeling that he would n't do it anyway,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Oolitic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON>, wrote letters to a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> newspaper and called the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, D-Ind., and others she thought could help locate the brother He was found this week, but <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that he wanted nothing to do with his brother. `` I'm not even going to consider it,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. `` If I sound cruel, well that's the way I feel. I'm not a very forgiving person. If he dies, he dies.'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, on leave from his job as a heavy assembly operator at the RCA plant in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, was diagnosed in December as having leukemia. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said his disease is in remission and he hopes to leave the hospital next week. He said his physician is considering a treatment used when no compatible donors are available. The procedure involves removing the victim's bone marrow and treating it to remove leukemic cells before returning it. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said he had n't talked to his younger brother in 16 years and was n't disappointed that he refused to help. He said he is not sure what caused the rift between the brothers, who grew up in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> playing basketball and fishing together. He said his brother `` got into that long-haired stuff'' before he left <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` We tried to figure out what he was mad about. We just figured he had a chip on his shoulder,'' the elder brother said. `` <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> was always a loner. He got worse after <PERSON> Dad </PERSON> died in 1967. `` I'm glad he's OK. I'd like to see him,'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> added.

<HEAD>Reagan Proposes Cutting Agriculture Spending by 5 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed on Thursday to cut spending for agriculture in fiscal 1989 by 5 percent, including sharp reductions for two major rural development agencies. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget does not call for new legislation or cuts in most farm commodity programs. Officials said the one major exception will be an administration attempt to overhaul the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar program, which includes protective import quotas and price supports. Food programs, including school lunches and food stamps, were left largely unchanged. A year ago, for example, the administration sought to exclude children from affluent families from sharing in the subsidized school lunch program. No such attempt was made this time. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> proposals include sharp cutbacks in rural housing programs operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, to less than $ 1.4 billion in 1989 from outlays of more than $ 3.3 billion this year. Direct loans by the <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to electric and telephone borrowers would be replaced by a system of 70 percent guaranteed loans from private lenders. That would mean a net REA saving of $ 478 million. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> has previously supported legislation that would reduce the sugar price support from the current 18 cents a pound to 12 cents so domestic sugar would be more competitive with imports. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> contends the high price supports artificially stimulate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic production, thus forcing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to impose tighter quotas on imports. The budget reference to overhauling the sugar program brought a critical reponse from <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON>, a member of the executive committee of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sweetener </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to keep the current program. If the administration prevails, the winners will be `` the giant industrial corporations that use sweeteners to make soft drinks, candy and processed foods,'' he said. The losers will be `` hundreds of thousands of American farmers'' who produce sugar cane, beets and sweetener-yielding corn, he said. On the other side, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Sweetener </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Users </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, called the current program a costly sham paid for by taxpayers and said `` it is appropriate that this issue be addressed'' in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget message. Under the proposed budget to operate <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> in the year beginning Oct. 1, total spending would be held to $ 48.3 billion, down from the estimated outlays of $ 50.7 billion in the current fiscal year. Part of the savings described by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> budget analysts comes from the improved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm economy, a pickup in commodity exports and general improvements in the agricultural supply-and-demand situation. A report by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> budget analysts said the department's 1989 spending blueprint `` is consistent with the budget summit agreement'' reached last November between the administration and congressional leaders. `` The budget does not renew proposals made -LRB- a year ago for fiscal 1988 -RRB- for new user fees, changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> payments to states, changes in the food assistance program, or privatization of the crop insurance program,'' the report said. `` Other than for the sugar program, the budget does not propose changes in farm price support programs.'' Most of the cutbacks in the farm commodity programs were already endorsed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the Food Security Act of 1985 or in subsequent legislation. The $ 76 billion deficit reduction package approved in December, for example, included a long list of money savers that will spill over into next fiscal year. Cutbacks in target prices for major crops, changes in basic formulas for price support loans to farmers, and many other adjustments and reductions were approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and are reflected in the proposed budget for <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> operations. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget shows total outlays for farm commodity programs in 1989 dropping to $ 17.1 billion from a revised estimate of about $ 17.7 billion this year. Outlays rose to a record of $ 25.8 billion in 1986, before declining to $ 22.4 billion in 1987, also a revised figure. Analysts said the two-year total for commodity program outlays of $ 34.8 billion represents a savings of $ 4.9 billion from estimates last August for 1988-89 program spending. `` Of this amount, $ 2.5 billion in savings can be attributed to the provisions of the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, and $ 2.4 billion in savings to improved supply-and-demand conditions,'' they said. But the long-standing drive by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to eliminate at least two rural development programs operated by <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> took another turn. Requests were included to operate water and sewer loans at $ 250 million, and business and industrial development loan guarantees at $ 96 million. Some other items: _ Food stamps, proposed at $ 12.5 billion, remained virtually the same as this year Average participation is projected to decline slightly to about 18.8 million people. _ The <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> would boost its level of farm operating loans to $ 4 billion from $ 3.1 billion this year, with guarantees to private lenders accounting for a larger share _ Research and education programs, at $ 1.19 billion, would be down from $ 1.25 billion in estimated outlays this year Emphasis would be on groundwater protection, rural development and food safety. _ Outlays for marketing and inspection services would be reduced to $ 860 million from $ 871 million

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Thursday proposed a $ 294 billion military budget that would reduce active-duty forces and kill cherished weapons programs to comply with a congressional freeze on his ambitious arms buildup. For the first time in a presidency that had earmarked $ 2 trillion for defense, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed significant cuts to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troop strength _ a drop of 34,000 men and women or 1.56 percent. He postponed, perhaps killed, such longstanding goals as providing the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> a 600-ship fleet. He called for retiring hundreds of helicopters and more than a dozen ships sooner than expected, urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give up on development of the mobile Midgetman nuclear missile and abandoned the ASAT satellite-killing rocket. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> blimps, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> drones and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spy planes also fell victim to his budget ax. All told, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked for budget authority totaling $ 299.5 billion for military programs, of which $ 294 billion would actually be paid out during the year starting Oct. 1. The fiscal 1989 totals represented increases from the $ 291.4 billion in budget authority and $ 285.4 billion in outlays set for this year _ but not enough to compensate for inflation, the president said. Unlike past years, the administration already had agreed with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the totals for military spending. That was done last November in a deal to reduce the national deficit, when the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreed to accept $ 299.5 billion in budget authority instead of the $ 332.4 billion it really wanted. Unveiled Thursday, then, were the details of how the administration had scaled back to reach the new targets. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> described the changes as painful and risky, but done to a clear set of priorities that emphasized quality over quantity. `` We've made the hard choices here,'' he said at a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing. `` We have traded off a smaller force in order to maintain a quality force.'' To illustrate what he meant, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> cited a request to provide military personnel a 4.3 percent pay raise next year instead of the 2 percent planned for civilian workers; a small increase in spending for operations and maintenance to ensure adequate training and deployment schedules; and continued production of existing modern weapons such as the M-1A1 tank and the AH-64 Apache helicopter. In dividing up the 26.1 percent of federal outlays that would go to defense in fiscal 1989, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the administration would not abandon certain longstanding priorities. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> wants $ 4.55 billion for the Star Wars missile defense system, compared with $ 3.55 billion this year. An additional $ 402 million is being sought for <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> work on Star Wars. The Pentagon is also asking to continue work on a rail-mobile version of the MX missile, and is requesting $ 1.4 billion for another Trident nuclear submarine, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. On the other hand, the combined active-duty roster of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> will be reduced gradually this year from 2,172,000 to 2,138,000 and then held at that level throughout fiscal 1989, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> will be hit the hardest, giving up about 23,000 jobs toward the total 34,000 being cut. The Army will deactivate a motorized infantry brigade at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and cancel the scheduled activation of two light infantry battalions in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will scrap plans to establish a 14th air wing at the <LOCATION> Miramar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> and retire 16 frigates and one submarine it wanted to keep. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> will deactivate two fighter wings and start deactivating a third. In other moves, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> comptroller <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> said:

Because of the budget environment, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he had directed the services to change their planning guidelines for the four years after fiscal 1989 to assume after-inflation increases of 2 percent instead of 3 percent. Such growth will be the minimum necessary to reverse four years of lower-than-inflation increases, he said.

<HEAD>Final AIDS Vaccine Testing May Have To Be Done Overseas, Official

<TEXT>
 Final testing of any AIDS vaccine might have to be done in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> rather than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AIDS infection rate is not high enough to determine whether a vaccine is working, a government researcher said Thursday. Such final testing of a vaccine would pose `` a significant problem in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases and coordinator of the government's AIDS research efforts. Even among homosexual men, the rate of new infections is no longer high enough to provide sufficient data on a vaccine's effectiveness, <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said The new infection rate among gay men in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is so low, for example, that a test of a vaccine's effectiveness would take eight years and require thousands of volunteers, he said. <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> testified before the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic, and spoke in a later interview. <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> told the commission he was talking about `` Phase III'' trials, which test how well a vaccine prevents infection. Current experimental AIDS vaccines are in Phase I trials, meant only to see whether they are safe and whether they spur an immune response. The next step, Phase II, aims to find the proper safe dose that gives maximum immune system response. Phase III testing requires the administration of the vaccine to healthy people likely to be exposed to the disease. These subjects are then followed for a period of time to see whether or not they contract the disease. In the interview, <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said that despite substantial infection rates among intravenous drug abusers, they are difficult to study because `` they do n't come back'' for follow-up research once a project begins. Given the situation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> told the commission, scientists must consider doing Phase III trials in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or elsewhere where the new infection rate is still high. He later said <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> are other possibilities. <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said preliminary discussions have begun with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and with health officials in Central Africa. No agreements have been reached, he said, but the Africans are `` certainly flexible and open to the possibility of holding these trials.'' He also predicted that no vaccine for acquired immune deficiency syndrome would be available for general use before 1995. In separate testimony, AIDS expert <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Dana-Farber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> declared, `` nobody can predict with certainty that an AIDS vaccine can ever be made.'' But, he said, `` I remain cautiously optimistic.'' A vaccine is a substance that produces an immune system response that will fight off infection. There are other drugs that attack a virus directly. <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> said the AIDS virus evades the disease-fighting immune system in several ways, including hiding underneath a surface coating of sugar that prevents key proteins from being attacked by immune system antibodies. In addition, the virus can infect cells and lie dormant, giving no sign of its presence to the immune system, he said. Even in the absence of a vaccine, he said, virus-fighting drugs may soon be harnessed to prevent infection. That may be useful for scientific and health workers who work with the virus, for newborns of infected mothers, sex partners of infected people and others at high risk of infection, he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Turns To Compromise In Election-Year Budget</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s $ 1.1 trillion election-year budget represents more political accommodation than the seven that preceded it. It gives Republicans a host of projects to champion and Democrats a chance to join them in fleeing town early to campaign. Instead of the deep domestic spending cuts and hefty defense increases that marked past <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budgets, the new spending outline appears designed to avoid fruitless controversy with the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In any other year, it could have been a budget alternative drafted by Democratic leaders: a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending request that does n't even keep pace with inflation, coupled with sharp increases for education, science, environmental cleanup and the battle against AIDS. And while the budget contains a raft of warmed over cost-cutting proposals from previous budgets _ sale of government loans, `` privatization'' of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> _ the focus this year is clearly on innovative new spending programs. Much of the fiscal 1989 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget was already preordained _ courtesy of a two-year framework agreement struck with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last fall that was designed to restore market confidence in the government's ability to govern in the aftermath of the stock market collapse. That pact set overall limits on defense spending, foreign aid, domestic spending and new taxes _ removing in a single stoke the objects of most past <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House-Congress </ORGANIZATION> budget brawls. `` It's a rather unique year,'' Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> conceded on Thursday. Echoed Budget Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> III: `` Things are different this year. We have an agreement. Their numbers are our numbers an our numbers are their numbers.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> also suggested that, with party conventions and re-election campaigns fast approaching, no one is going to want to stay in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> longer than necessary to engage in protracted budget battles. `` They -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- need to work very fast on this budget, and I anticipate they will do so.'' And, while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was not expected to swallow the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spending proposals whole, the new budget was better received on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> than any recent adminstration offering. `` I think it's a good faith budget,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. `` It looks like it meets the -LRB- budget -RRB- summit agreements It's right at the targets.'' Still, the administration went one step further than those targets in crafting a politically palatable budget document _ in some cases staking out for itself, territory that previously had been claimed by the Democrats. For instance, after being widely condemned last year for proposing a nearly $ 5 billion cut in education spending, the administration did a flip-flop in the new budget and called for a $ 1.5 billion increase. Not only does that make political life easier for congressional Republicans this year, but it also robs Democrats of a potential campaign issue. `` The president has decided to make education a priority,'' said Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` ... We think it's good politics.'' `` It's pointless to waste time with a budget proposal which virtually no one in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> takes seriously,'' he added. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> says that the about-face on eduction should n't be a surprise. `` This is an election year. In election years, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House supports eduction. In every other year, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has sought deep cuts.'' In other dramatic changes, the new <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget calls for large increases in combating acid rain and in cleaning up the nation's toxic waste dumps _ two programs critics had accused the administration of neglecting in the past Proposals for $ 1.3 billion in additional funds for AIDS research and correspondingly sharp increases in funds for building more federal prisons, modernizing the air control system and making the space shuttle safer and more reliable are also likely to play well in this election year. In addition, the administration has thrown <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> another election-year bone: a rosy economic forecast. The administration's budget assumes declining inflation, falling interest rates and an economic growth rate of 2.4 percent this year and 3.5 percent next year _ somewhat more optimistic than the forecasts by private and congressional economists. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> economic assumptions would result in a lowering of the federal deficit from its current $ 150 billion to $ 129.5 billion in fiscal 1989, well below the target in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, according to the administration. By contrast, a recent <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> analysis suggests that the 1989 deficit could be as high as $ 176 billion _ even under the budget agreement. But, by accepting the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget forecasts _ and not those of its own budget office _ <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have an easier time producing the needed savings to meet the Gramm-Rudman target, at least on paper. And <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will do just that _ under a revision added last year when the Gramm-Rudman law was revised. Even though a deteriorating economy could eventually bring the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> back to the negotiating table to find more savings, accepting the more optimistic White House projections will at least buy time for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ time to pay more attention to election-year politics. `` This is the year of the big wink,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 An ailing 81-year-old woman tried to shoot her retarded son to death because she was afraid to leave him `` at the mercy of strangers,'' her attorney said Thursday. <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON> was sentenced Wednesday to 30 months' probation at a nursing home by Circuit Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>, who said, `` Sometimes a mother's love puts people in strange situations.'' The aggravated battery charge carried a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine of $ 10,000. `` It was an act of love and compassion for her son. Being the only one who had ever, ever cared for him, she felt it her responsibility to make sure he was at peace before she died,'' Assistant Public Defender <PERSON> Laureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said Thursday. `` She had indicated that she wanted to take his life and then would take her own,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, adding her client suffers from poor eyesight, emphysema, loss of hearing and is losing her memory. Ms. <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ingleside </LOCATION> admitted shooting her 51-year-old son, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Butch </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON>, who suffers from dwarfism as well as developmental disabilities. `` I did n't want to leave him behind,'' she told the court from her wheelchair before sentencing. `` I was going blind, my health was failing every day. He would be on the mercy of the world. I did n't want that, your honor. I love him too much for that,'' she said. Block said Ms. <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON> could have supervised visits with her son, whom she had been allowed to see only once since her arrest in early October. Ms. <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON> is to spend her probationary period at nearby <LOCATION> Hillcrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Retirement </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, where she has been since her arrest. She was not taking telephone calls Thursday, said a staff member at <LOCATION> Hillcrest </LOCATION> who refused to give her name. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON> will remain at the <ORGANIZATION> Waukegan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where he has been since early October. Center officials would not discuss his case, said <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidtbauer </PERSON>, who answered the telephone there. Ms. <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON> fired the .22 caliber pistol on Sept. 30 intending to shoot her son in the heart, but the bullet pierced his shoulder and then the gun jammed, <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Chief Deputy State's Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I do n't think society can condone what she did,'' he said. `` But you can empathize with her feelings. I do n't have any qualms about the outcome.'' The shooting was reported a few days later by a neighbor who recognized the bullet wound after <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON> complained that his shoulder hurt, <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said. Police and prosecutors were unable to question the victim because of his disabilities, he said. `` This case was more of a human tragedy than most criminal cases. In a lot of cases you view the defendent as a bad guy _ you ca n't really say she was a bad guy,'' <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON>, who has the mental capabilities of a young child, did small tasks for his mother like going to the store or getting the paper, Ms. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. He can not read or write. Ms. <PERSON> Sagel </PERSON> shot her son because she `` feared he would be at the mercy of strangers and be taken for granted and even abused,'' Ms. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. She described the Sagels' relationship as `` the most intense level of the mother-son relationship I've ever seen.'' `` When I talk to her about seeing him, she really lights up. She always says, ` Tell him I love him.' Just like a mother.'''

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> imposed tough rules on the occupied territories Thursday that are intended to cripple the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> economically unless they stop strikes, witholding of taxes and other acts of civil disobedience. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he would not trade concessions for an end to 10 weeks of riots in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` Those who incite and resort to violence should not come away with any reward,'' he said. An economic boycott of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has become a growing accompaniement to the violence in the occupied lands. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s new restrictions are designed to hinder the flow of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> funds into the territories, and requiring merchants to prove they have paid taxes could curtail the daily trade in produce and other goods across the <LOCATION> Allenby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> between the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Arrests were reported Thursday but no casualties in confrontations between soldiers and protesters in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials say 55 Arabs have been killed in the violence that began Dec. 8. News photographers saw a Jewish settler fire shots into the air at the Dheishe refugee camp to disperse stone-throwing young Palestinians, and protests were reported in Arab neighborhoods of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Soldiers arrested 21 Arabs suspected of inciting and participating in riots in <LOCATION> Burka </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The military confirmed arrests were made, but said disclosing the number would violate policy. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police plan an operation involving 1,500 officers, some brought in from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns, who will perform round-the-clock guard duty in Arab neighborhoods starting Sunday, the radio said. It said police also would arrest suspected ringleaders in an effort to curb disturbances that are expected later this month when Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. City spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Devara </PERSON> confirmed the report. Increasing numbers of the 1.5 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> have adopted passive resistance to oppose <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation, which began when the territories were captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Leaflets and radio broadcasts urge them not to pay taxes to the Jewish state, work for Israelis or buy Israeli-made goods. Only about half the 105,000 Palestinians who worked in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> before Dec. 8 now do so. Only a small percentage of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> have paid taxes so far this year, according to the Arab-run <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and such Israeli sources as the army's information center Militants put pressure on Palestinians to keep up the boycott. A teen-ager stabbed a fellow <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> in the face Thursday, apparently because he drove Palestinians to work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. `` If the trend continues and takes root, it will become a serious problem,'' said a senior official in the military government that administers the territories. He said the new financial restrictions require Palestinians to prove they have paid their taxes before they can travel abroad or import or export goods, and also must register when they bring $ 1,000 or more into the country. The previous limit was $ 5,000. The limitation on money is intended to make it difficult for the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to support Arabs who stay away from their jobs. Restrictions on imports and exports could have a serious effect on the daily trade with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on which Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> are heavily dependent. `` We hope this, combined with other measures, will help quell the disturbances,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` The people have to decide who they should be more afraid of, the Israelis or the Arab inciters.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, Arab-American director of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Violence </ORGANIZATION>, said the new restrictions would not quash growing support for peaceful resistance. `` What we are going to do is hide our income so we wo n't have to pay taxes on it,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will urge people to pay cash instead of checks and not to use money changers or banks.'' Although the government canceled <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s residency permit because of his calls for non-violent resistance, he has not been expelled. His <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> address is <LOCATION> Wapakoneta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official said Arabs hurt themselves by refusing to pay taxes. `` We raised about $ 114 million in taxes from the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in 1987, and that money goes back into the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> towns to maintain a good quality of life,'' he said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> collects taxes on property, and business and personal income. There also are import duties, a sales tax and stamp taxes on documents. Discord between <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, his partner and rival in the coalition government, has been growing. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc had not produced a single peace initiative that `` paves the way for negotiations to resolve the confict between us and the Arabs. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in a speech to the Jewish Agency's board of governors that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not move too quickly to give the Palestinians new rights. `` There is a need for a considerable period of ... coexistence between us and the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> authorities before the question of sovereignty can be approached,'' he said, adding the comment about rewarding violence. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will pursue is said to call for <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to elect new leaders with whom <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would negotiate a plan for self-rule.

<HEAD>Administration Forecasts Modest Growth With No Threat Of Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on Thursday said the economy was shrugging off the impact of the October stock market collapse and would enjoy modest growth this presidential election year with no threat of a recession. In its 1989 budget request, the administration foresaw no storm clouds on the economic horizon, contending that growth would slow during the first half of 1988 but then rebound to robust levels in 1989 and beyond. The administration's economic forecasts, which provide the underpinning for its assumptions on revenues and spending in the budget, have been attacked in the past as `` rosy scenarios'' which bore little resemblance to reality. But this year's version was greeted with less skepticism, although it was still more optimistic than the outlook prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and most private economists. `` In the last couple of years, the administration has lightened the tint on their rose-colored glasses although their outlook is still a lot rosier than we think is justified,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the country's leading economic forecasting firms. The administration derided as `` greatly exaggerated'' the recession fears stirred by the record 508-point drop in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19, contending that the economy had escaped with `` few signs of serious damage.'' The administration predicted the gross national product, the total output of goods and services, would expand at a modest rate of 2.4 percent this year, down from 3.8 percent growth in 1987, when measured from the fourth quarter of 1986. Congressional analysts are forecasting lower growth of 1.8 percent in 1988 and <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said Data Resources has just scaled back its own GNP forecast to 1.4 percent, a full percentage point below the administration. Lower economic growth means less tax revenue for the government and thus larger budget deficits. The administration calls for reducing the deficit to $ 129.5 billion in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, down from an actual deficit of $ 150.2 billion in 1987 and an estimated $ 146.7 billion in the current fiscal year. In its long-range forecasts, the administration sees the deficit still at $ 79.3 billion in 1991, slightly above the $ 78 billion deficit the government was running in 1981 when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office with a pledge to balance the budget within three years. In its eighth budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the administration blamed some familiar foes for its biggest economic failure, the doubling of the national debt. The administration placed much of the blame on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for failing to accept <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s program of domestic spending cuts. It also cited the 1981-82 recession, saying the severe downturn boosted the deficit by $ 112 billion in 1983 alone. The administration conceded that a worse-than-expected economic performance could doom even its more modest expectations on deficit reductions. The budget document said that if economic growth is just 1 percent lower than the administration is forecasting over the next five years it would add $ 6.3 billion to the 1989 deficit and $ 66 billion to the 1993 deficit. In its economic assumptions, the administration forecast: _ GNP growth will rebound in 1989 to a 3.5 percent rate and stay above 3 percent through 1993. Many private economists expect the new president will very likely face a recession in 1989 or 1990. The current recovery has already lasted a peacetime record of 63 months, twice as long as the normal recovery. _ Consumer prices, which rose 4.4 percent last year, will rise by 4.3 percent this year and decline steadily over the next four years to a 2 percent rate of inflation in 1993. _ Unemployment will show no improvement this year, because of the modest growth forecast, but will not get worse, either, holding steady at the current 5.8 percent rate. In following years, the jobless rate, which many economists believe is approaching effective full employment, will dip slightly to 5.2 percent by the end of 1993.

 <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, had been an outspoken supporter of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of greater openness, but it led to his downfall when his criticism apparently went farther than the Soviet leader was willing to allow <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 57, was fired from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> post Nov. 11 after he criticized the party's style of leadership and the slow pace of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies _ known as perestroika _ during a meeting of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. At the next <ORGANIZATION> Centra </ORGANIZATION>, l <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, which ended Thursday, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was dropped from his position as a candidate, or non-voting member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> two years ago to take over the party organization that had been run by <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Grishin </PERSON>, who was tainted by charges of corruption. He raised topics that previous officials had left untouched. He discussed the existence of special food stores for the Soviet elite, he used mass transit and made unannounced visits to stores to see if the products were fresh. But when <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was stripped of the job in November, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sharply criticized him for being overly ambitious. In remarks that were printed in the official press, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said he was `` very guilty'' before the local party organization and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Purported copies of his Oct. 21 <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> speech that were circulated in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and printed in some Western newspapers said he had even criticized the style of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>. He was hospitalized for heart problems after he lost the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party leadership, but since has returned to work in his new job as a deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a position that carries the rank of a government minister. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s ouster was seen by some Soviets and Western observers as a bad omen for the continuation of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of promoting a greater variety of opinions and more openness, known by the Russian word `` glasnost.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged in a speech to writers and artists in January that the firing of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> `` was viewed by some intellectuals, especially the young people, as a blow to perestroika.'' However, he said that was the `` greatest delusion.''

<TEXT>
 Republicans in the state Assembly declared themselves unanimously opposed Wednesday to Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s plan to permit distribution of hypodermic needles to some drug addicts to combat the spread of AIDS. The 56 Republicans from the 150-member Assembly approved a resolution calling for the issue to be submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and not handled administratively by state Health Commissioner Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>. `` The way the free-needle plan was approved is as dubious as the plan itself,'' said Assembly Minority Leader <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappleyea </PERSON>. `` The notion of state-subsidized drug abuse is abhorrent.'' Republican Assemblyman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pataki </PERSON> called the plan `` constitutionally, scientifically and practically flawed.'' The Republican resolution said that `` dispensing needles to addicts not only undermines society's battle against drugs, but provides a contradictory message to our children who are being taught to say ` No' to drugs.'' Possession of hypodermic needles without a prescription is a crime in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but the health commissioner has the discretion to exempt certain classes of people from the law. That's what <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> has said he will do when he and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Health Commissioner Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> settle on the details of a test program in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` It's a very limited program of only 200 people and a carefully controlled test of the idea to see if it can change behavior,'' said <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has said the experiment will be closely monitored and ended quickly if it does n't have any impact on the spread of AIDS. The proposal calls for providing needles only to about 200 addicts who have applied for drug-treatment programs. The experiment is expected to last for about six months. As part of the plan, the state is supposed to expand its drug-treatment programs that are already unable to handle all the applicants. Most case of AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, have appeared in homosexual males or intravenous drug users. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the majority of the new cases of the fatal disease, for which there is no known cure, have appeared in drug users. Researchers believe that the disease spreads among drug addicts because they share needles that may be contaminated by tainted blood.

<TEXT>
 A majority of striking employees at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s British plants voted Thursday to accept a two-year contract offer, signaling the end of the country's first major industrial strike in three years. The offer represented the first significant union victory in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in seven years. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> made several concessions to end the strike, which began Feb. 8. Voter returns Thursday night showed 70 percent of the workers at the 22 British plants favored the offer, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. The company said it expected workers to be back on the job Monday. The Transport and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents two-thirds of the workers, confirmed that about 70 percent of its members supported the proposal. A final vote count was expected to be released Friday. The settlement was worked out in negotiations Tuesday between company and union officials. The company backed down on its demand for a three-year contract, offering the two-year pact instead, and agreed to a wage increase of at least 14 percent over the term of the contract. Previously, it offered an increase of 7 percent in the first year and 2.5 percent above the rate of inflation _ which is currently 3.3 percent _ over the next two years. A middle-range worker earned $ 327 a week under the old contract. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> won some changes in work practices to boost productivity, but they must be agreed to on the plant level rather than imposed by management. The last major <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> union victory occurred in February 1981, when Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> backed off plans to close coal pits after miners threatened a nationwide strike. The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> strike has prompted layoffs of more than 9,700 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> workers in Genk, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. It also threatened production at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plants in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which rely on parts made at the British plants. The car company said it did n't know when production at the Genk plant would return to normal. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said the strike, the to hit the automaker in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in nearly a decade, was costing the company $ 350 million in lost production. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s British workers last struck in 1978, when they walked out for nine weeks. The strike, combined with a recent walkout by ferry workers and labor unrest in the state-run <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and coal mines, prompted concern that there might be a new wave of industrial strikes and an increase in pay demands in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has been relatively free of labor strife since Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government came to power and curbed the influence of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s once-powerful unions. The last major industrial strike in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was a yearlong walkout by more than 90,000 coal miners in 1984-85. It ended in defeat for their union.

 A 9-year-old boy who survived almost 40 minutes under water in an ice-covered pond walked out of the hospital Wednesday, and doctors said he had made almost a complete recovery from his near-drowning five weeks earlier. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was in a coma for two weeks after he fell through the ice Jan. 12 near his <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> home, in northeastern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. But doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said he progressed rapidly once he recovered consciousness. `` We're all humbled as caretakers to see what many of us would consider, if not miraculous, a near-miraculous recovery,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Tecklenburg </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>'s attending physicians. `` I thank God for giving everyone the knowledge and skills to do what they've done for my child. It's a miracle,'' said the boy's mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> received parting gifts of a new electronic musical keyboard and a bicyle. He and family members met with reporters prior to his release. Asked how he felt, <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> shyly said, `` Good,'' and agreed that while he would have to return to school, he was n't quite ready to do so. Smiling brightly, the youth wearing black jeans with suspenders, a blue-striped shirt and a white hat, evoked laughter from reporters and hospital workers as the keyboard suddenly sounded a syncopated rhythm. `` I do n't know how to play this thing,'' he said with a laugh. <PERSON> Tecklenburg </PERSON> said the keyboard was an appropriate gift because the first time the youth opened his eyes after the accident it was to the sound of a similar keyboard. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> was playing with two companions on the frozen surface of a pond when the ice gave way. His two friends were rescued quickly from the water, but it took rescuers almost 40 minutes to fish <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> out using grappling hooks. <PERSON> Tecklenburg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> is one of only about five children in the medical literature to have been under water for more than 30 minutes and recovered completely. In icy water, the body's metabolism slows and the brain does n't need as much oxygen The reflex is particularly powerful in children, doctors say. <PERSON> Tecklenburg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> tested at his age level on several standardized tests administered about 10 days ago. `` <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> has very minimal disabilities,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, another physician who treated the youth. She said he may start out going to only a half day of school to allow his endurance to build up and said he may be seen by a speech therapist, if needed. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that during her son's recovery `` everybody kept telling me to keep the faith and do n't give up. All I could do is keep praying.'' Cards and letters for <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> were sent from throughout the nation and <PERSON> Tecklenburg </PERSON> called it `` a tribute to our country that so many people have been concerned about <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, for only the second time in eight budgets, asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday to increase spending on education, with much of the extra $ 1.5 billion going to help students pay for college. The administration also requested modest increases in several social programs including rental vouchers for low-income families, drug abuse prevention, foster care and adoption assistance, and prenatal care for pregnant women. But some programs for the needy would suffer cuts under the proposal, including a $ 400 million, 25 percent cut in help for the poor to pay heating and cooling bills. Head Start would be frozen at $ 1.2 billion, and other social programs would be left with no increases or small ones lagging behind inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed $ 20.3 billion fiscal 1989 budget is $ 1.5 billion, or 8 percent higher, than what it expects to spend this year. The administration asked for budget authority of $ 21.2 billion _ fully $ 7.2 billion more than it sought for the department 12 months ago. The proposed budget adds $ 590 million to the <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> program for needy college and trade school students, for a total of nearly $ 5 billion, and raises the maximum individual grant in 1989-90 to $ 2,300, a $ 100 increase. Some 3.4 million students would receive grants that year, up from an estimated 3.1 million this fall and 2.9 million during the current academic year. An additional $ 517 million would be spent on Chapter 1, the tutoring program for disadvantaged children at risk of academic failure, bringing it up to nearly $ 4.4 billion to serve 5.6 million students. The administration proposed modest expansions of magnet school, drug education, adult literacy and handicapped education programs, and wants to increase college loans that tie repayments to future income levels. It also asked for a college savings bond program, widely supported in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, with tax-free interest on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds used for postsecondary education. Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, asked to explain the budget reversal, said, `` It's pointless to waste time with a budget proposal which virtually no one in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> takes seriously.'' The administration has only requested education increases in 1984 and 1988 _ both presidential election years. Asked about the timing, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` We hope it's good politics. We think it's sensible. Despite the boosts in some areas, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he expected `` the ` whine-ometer' will still register'' among department critics. He was not disappointed. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said his union welcomed ` ` the administration's turnaround'' but said there are `` still many gaps in the president's priorities <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, derided the proposal as an election-year ploy `` that does children ... no favors.'' She said the program for students at risk serves 1.3 million fewer children than in 1980 and should be funded at $ 20 billion to reach all who need it. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Priorities </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal watchdog group, said, `` It's an improvement over previous <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budgets.'' But he charged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was inflicting cuts on programs for the needy to pay for a 29 percent boost in the space program. In addition to the reduction in energy aid, <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> cited proposed reductions in aid to soup kitchens, food banks and shelter for the homeless; low-income rural housing; legal services for the poor; refugee assistance; community development and community service block grants; and housing assistance for the low-income elderly and handicapped.

<TEXT>
 Two scientists who reported isolating an AIDS-related human virus say they now think some original samples were probably monkey virus, but that scientific conclusions about it remain unchanged. <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Essex </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, writing in Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature, say certain virus samples they reported in 1986 as HTLV-IV from healthy Africans should be considered an AIDS virus from monkeys instead. Their virus has since been found in humans. It is now considered to be HIV-2, a virus restricted chiefly to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The AIDS virus found in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is called HIV-1. The Harvard scientists' statement accompanies a report by researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Southborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The report gives evidence that original HTLV-IV samples were actually monkey virus that had contaminated human cells in the laboratory. The study reports unusually strong similarities between the HTLV-IV samples and a `` simian immunodeficiency virus'' found in macaques. <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION>, in a telephone interview, said the new data made it likely that some original HTLV-IV samples were monkey virus. He also said he knew of no subsequent studies that would have to be considered invalid because of the mistake. In a Nature editorial, <PERSON> Carel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> said the original misidentification will not affect results of epidemiological studies of the virus by <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kanki </PERSON>. But the incident should serve as a warning to virologists, he wrote. He said he knew of, or has been told of, at least five instances in other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and European laboratories where cells were accidentally infected with HIV-1 in the laboratory. In the past, several scientists have said they suspected laboratory contamination in the original report of HTLV-IV.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Thursday declared that AIDS is his `` highest public health priority'' and asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a 38 percent budget boost, to $ 1.3 billion, to combat the deadly and spreading disease. In addition, the budget envisions spending $ 736 million under Medicaid and Medicare to care for people already suffering from the illness. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> consistently has appropriated more than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> requested for AIDS, but the general outlines for the fiscal 1989 proposal were worked out in closer consultation than in previous years and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not as likely to vote a large addition this year. For example, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s initial request for AIDS spending for fiscal 1988 was $ 534 million, compared with the $ 951 million eventually approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. For fiscal 1987, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> initially requested $ 213 million for AIDS and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wound up allocating $ 502 million. The huge jump for AIDS spending stands out even more starkly when compared with the net increase of 5.8 percent proposed for overall operation of the 250 programs administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees roughly a third of all federal spending. The total <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> budget is to rise from $ 375.1 billion to $ 396.8 billion. But the bulk of that _ nearly 95 percent _ goes for so-called entitlement programs, such as Social Security, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid, over which the administration has marginal control because basic eligiblity criteria _ including treatment of AIDS patients _ are laid down by law. Social Security's old age and disability programs alone are expected to grow by $ 14 billion, or 6.4 percent, to $ 233.8 billion. That includes money for new recipients coming onto the rolls as the population ages as well as an anticipated 4.2 percent cost-of-living increase next January for all 38 million beneficiaries. Medicaid, the state-federal health program for poor people, will cost the federal government $ 32.7 billion in 1989, up 7 percent from $ 30.7 billion currently. Much of the Medicaid increase is attributed to additional spending on AIDS patients, an estimated 40 percent of whom qualify for the program either when they first contract the disease or soon afterward because they become unable to work. Medicaid spending on AIDS is estimated at $ 375 million this year and is budgeted to grow to $ 600 million next year. Medicare spending for 33 million elderly or disabled workers is projected to rise to $ 84 billion from $ 78.9 billion. The most controversial part of the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> budget is likely to be <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal for $ 1.2 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> cuts he says are necessary to meet the deficit-reduction targets that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration agreed to in December. Those differences largely boil down to disagreement over whether <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> projections of overall Medicare spending are more accurate than those projected by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. Deficit negotiators agreed previously to cut $ 3.5 million from <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and the administration argues that the $ 1.2 billion cut in its proposal will be needed to meet that target. The chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> already have written to the White House expressing determination to fight the additional cut. Of the $ 1.2 billion in question, about $ 1 billion would come from reducing special payments made to large teaching hospitals to help cover educational costs of interns. At a briefing on the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> budget, department chief of staff <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> cited a recent inspector general's finding that the teaching hospitals' Medicare profits are 2 -LCB- times that of their non-teaching counterparts. `` It would seem these hospitals are going to be able to absorb this reduction,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. The other $ 200 million in savings would come from limiting <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payments for durable medical equipment, reducing payments for radiology and anesthesiology services, closing `` a loophole in payments for home dialysis treatment for end-stage renal disease,'' more intense of physician claims, and by making permanent the existing requirement that <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Part </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> monthly premiums _ now $ 24.80 _ cover 25 percent of the program costs. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reports that as of Jan. 25, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 51,916 Americans, of whom more than half, or 28,965, have died since 1979. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts from the text of Thursday's address to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, as translated into English by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency: -LRB- Education -RRB- There is absolutely no doubt that everything that concerns school, education and upbringing is directly linked to the development of socialism, to perestroika Moreover, it is its major direction.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The teacher is a major protagonist of perestroika. Should he support us with conviction, sense and passion, perestroika will gain many new sincere advocates and fighters, successors to the revolutionary socialist cause.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 He must be relieved of petty patronage, suspicion towards his pursuits and findings must be lifted. He should be relieved of duties other than teaching, his time and strengyh must be released for the main thing. All obstacles and barriers in the way of innovation in pedagogics must be removed, decent material conditions must be created for the teacher's creative endeavor.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 -LRB- Socialism and past mistakes -RRB- Over 70 years our party and people have been inspired by the ideas of socialism and have been building it. But because of external and internal causes we have been unable to fully realize the Leninist principles of the new social system. This was seriously hampered by the cult of personality, the system of management by command and administration that formed in the thirties, bureaucratic, dogmatic and voluntarist aberration, arbitrariness, and late in the seventies _ early in the eighties _ lack of initiative and hindrances that have led to stagnation.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 These phenomena and what has remained of them and come down to the present should become things of the past. In this lies the answer to those who express their doubt if we are not retreating from socialism, from its foundations laid down by generations of Soviet people. No, we do not retreat if only a step from socialism, from Marxism-Leninism, from everything that has been gained and created by the people. But we decisively reject dogmatic, bureaucratic and voluntarist legacy as it has nothing in common either with <PERSON> Marxism-Leninsim </PERSON> or with genuine socialism.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Free competition of minds is needed. Our social thinking stands to gain from this. Its prognosticating capacity will be enhanced and, hence, its ability to serve as a reliable basis for working out the party's policy will increase.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 -LRB- Nationalities -RRB- True internationalism, true friendship of peoples are possible only if there is deep respect for dignity, honor, culture, language and history of every people, extensive relations among them. We ought to facilitate in all ways the further broadening of contacts between national cultures, their mutual enrichment, their development and flourishing. Soviet patriotism is the greatest of our values, any manifestations of nationalism and chauvinism are incompatible with it. Nationalism in any form is blind, attempts at self-isolation lead only to a spiritual blind alley. The knowledge and understanding of the scope, grandeur and human specifics of socialist revolution, the struggle of the party and the people, full of truth and heroic spirit, and defense of socialist motherland feed the roots of Soviet patriotism. Here we approach a very important issue _ unification through revolution and Soviet power of national honor and national heritage of every people and internationalism of socialist society. In short we should set to thoroughly tackle nationalities policy at the present stage _ in all areas, including theory and practice. This is the most fundamental, vital issue of our society. I think that one of the plenums of the central committee should be devoted to problems of nationalities policy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 -LRB- Politics -RRB- We should firmly pursue the line of reinforcing the legal levers of perestroika, first of all to prevent the law on state enterprises and other legal instruments for economic reform from being diluted with all manner of departmental instructions and directives.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The main problem in developing our political system is to create a mechanism of power and government with precisely regulated effective democratic control and corresponding legal procedures which would drastically diminish and even reduce to naught the element of chance in handling major political, state issues and preclude the possibility of subjectivity at all floors of our political system. It is necessary to achieve that decisions of principled importance be worked out and adopted with the people's active participation. This will correspond to our socialist democracy. Priority should be given to cardinally changing the role of the soviets -LRB- governing councils -RRB- as the core of the political system of our society and its embodiment in state bodies. It is in the way the soviets are formed and function that the democratic principles of socialism must be realized in the first place. In a sense, we are talking today about the need to revive the Soviet system of government in <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s interpretation. We should make the soviets at all levels agencies of state authority and administration that will be really working, demonstrating initiative and enjoying full rights.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 We should take account in the soviets of the entire diversity of our country, including national features. And, of course, we should not bypass the Supreme Soviet of the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>. We are to re-think its role so as to increase the effectiveness of its activites, starting from the presidium and full-scale parliamentary sessions and ending with the work of the commissions and individual deputies The key issue of reform in the political system concerns delimiting the functions of party and state bodies.

<HEAD>New York's Top Court Strikes Down Anti-Loitering Law</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s highest court struck down a ban on loitering in subway, train or bus stations Wednesday, unanimously ruling that the statute gives police too much leeway in deciding when people are breaking the law. The anti-loitering law prohibits people from sleeping in transportation facilities or staying there without giving authorities a `` satisfactory explanation'' of what they're doing. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said in its 7-0 decision, `` Such a generalized law fails to distinguish between conduct calculated to cause harm and conduct that is essentially innocent, thereby failing to give -LRB- a person -RRB- adequate notice of what conduct is prohibited.'' The court ruled in favor of two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> men arrested in 1985 for loitering in separate incidents at <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> and the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Both were charged with other crimes after their arrests. The court said the law gives too much latitude to a police officer to decide whether a person's explanation is satisfactory. That, Judge <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Titone </PERSON> wrote, makes the law unconstitutional. Simply requiring a person to explain his actions also violates a citizen's right to remain silent when questioned by police, the court said. `` He -LRB- a suspect -RRB- is faced with the choice of either forgoing his constitutional right to remain silent in the hope that his explanation will satisfy that particular law enforcement official, or invoking his constitutional right to remain silent and being arrested,'' <PERSON> Vitone </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, who argued the case for the district attorney's office, said Wednesday she would withhold comment on the decision until she has a chance to read it <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxian </PERSON>, a Legal Aid attorney who represented the two men arrested for loitering, said the district attorney's office argued that overturning the law would make train stations and the <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> terminal havens for the homeless. But if the law is no good, lawyers ca n't worry about the unsavory impact of striking it down, she said. `` This decision is for ordinary people,'' she said. `` It says that you can be in the Port Authority terminal and not be subject to the whim of a transit police officer as to whether you have the right to be there.'' Police still have plenty of ways to protect people from crimes, <PERSON> Maxian </PERSON> said, citing laws against begging, trespassing and disorderly conduct. She said police often used the loitering statute to arrest people they suspected of drug activities when they had n't seen them engaged in actual criminal behavior. `` Police are still going to be able to arrest people for doing crimes,'' she said, `` but they ca n't just arrest people for being suspicious.'' The Court of Appeals decision' upheld previous determinations in the cases by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, two lower state courts.

<HEAD>Arrests And Mess Are Measures Of Carnival Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A record-breaking mess and fewer arrests were two measures of success for what may have been <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' biggest Mardi Gras. But another, grimmer statistic _ three deaths _ dimmed the Carnival afterglow. Carnival season begins each Jan. 6 and builds to a raucous climax on <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION>, French for Fat Tuesday, the day before the start of the Christian Lenten season. Police started keeping track of arrests Feb. 5, the day of the first major parades. And sanitation crews started weighing the morning-after garbage the next day. While some people use the intensity of their hangovers to gauge how much fun they had, <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFarland </PERSON> uses the weight of the garbage his sanitation crews pick up during the 12-day parade season to judge <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>' success. `` We have n't finished that,'' <PERSON> MacFarland </PERSON> said when asked if he had totalled up the tonnage yet. `` It's gon na take me another three days.'' <PERSON> MacFarland </PERSON> said close to 2,000 tons of garbage already had been collected by noon Wednesday. `` We think we may pass last year's record breaker of 2,001 tons,'' he said. Although garbage was up, arrests were down. Police Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said there were 1,621 arrests for various offenses. A year ago it was 1,948 and two years ago it was 2,072, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. He attributed the declining numbers to `` people behaving themselves.'' Although police say exact crowd estimates are difficult to make, veteran officers said Tuesday's crowds within the city limits were among the largest they've seen and likely surpassed the million mark. That was good economic news for a city experiencing hard times; a recent <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> study indicates that a good Carnival crowd can pump as much as $ 275 million into the economy. While crowds were generally well behaved, getting too close to moving carnival vehicles cost two lives. Witnesses at a parade in suburban <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> said 11-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupree </PERSON> darted under a decorated truck to grab Carnival trinkets tossed by riders and was crushed by the wheels of the slow-moving vehicle. He had grabbed items that had landed under other parade vehicles and had been warned by deputies and his sister to stay clear of the vehicles, witnesses said. In a separate incident in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, a man ran into traffic after a paade and tried to hop aboard a `` truck float'' that was leaving the city. He fell beneath the wheels of the tractor-trailer rig. His identity had not been confirmed Wednesday afternoon. The area had not recorded such parade-related deaths since 1983. Another apparent fatality occurred when an officer with the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Police </LOCATION> assigned to help control <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> crowds on a ferry slipped into the river as he helped pull aboard a woman who had fallen off the vessel. He disappeared in the water.

<HEAD>Award Reduced From $10.5 million to $375,000 for Woman Struck by
Bottle Cap</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A judge Wednesday reduced the award to an 83-year-old woman struck in the eye by a soda bottle cap from $ 10.5 million granted by a jury to $ 375,000. Third District Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigtrup </PERSON> said that jurors were `` inflamed with passion'' when they recently made the award to <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Holladay </LOCATION>. `` The award of $ 10 million appears to be disproportionate and unreasonable,'' <PERSON> Rigtrup </PERSON> said at a post-trial hearing. He awarded $ 75,000 in compensatory and $ 300,000 in punitive damages. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was struck in the eye when an aluminum twist cap blew off a 7-Up bottle she was opening. As a result of the injury, the sight in <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' left eye was impaired. <PERSON> Rigtrup </PERSON> said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> could accept his judgment, request a new trial within 15 days or appeal the decision. Although there was no evidence that <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' means of support was damaged by the accident, the judge said, 7-Up's actions warranted a judgment for significant injury to her eye. The company knew of the potential danger caused by the bottle caps since the late 1960s and has `` irresponsibly'' not remedied the problem, <PERSON> Rigtrup </PERSON> said. In arguing for 7-Up, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said new owners and management are concerned about the bottle cap problem and have taken steps to address the issue, but solutions do not come swiftly. He said between 1986 and 1988 the company knew of only one incident in which someone was injured with a bottle cap. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> acknowledged 7-Up is partly to blame for the accident, but the fact that <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' was attempting to open the bottle with pliers shows that she also was at fault. Defense attorney <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said he will discuss the possibility of an appeal and said his `` spunky'' client just may seek a new trial, despite her age. `` I'm as shocked about the judge's decision as I was with 7-Up's refusal to adjust the problem -LRB- caused by unsafe bottle caps -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said `` This is a sad day for consumers.''

<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and three aides will apply to travel to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> next month to attend an international trade union meeting, a spokesman for the banned Polish union said Wednesday. Spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has been invited to <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> on March 14-18 to attend the World Congress of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>. The invitation was extended by the <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said. Contacted at home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he received the invitation and would like to make the trip, but declined further comment. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, has not left <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since the union was declared illegal after the 1981 imposition of martial law.

 Actor <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, who was fined the equivalent of $ 175 for his role in a fatal car crash in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, issued a statement Wednesday saying he was pleased that a charge of reckless driving against him had been dismissed. The court decision, reached Monday in <LOCATION> Enniskillen </LOCATION>, has been denounced as a travesty by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, whose wife, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>, 28, and mother-in-law, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, 60, were killed in the crash Aug. 5. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> suffered a broken leg in the crash and his passenger, actress <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON>, was not hurt. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> remained in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> while a magistrate fined him for careless driving. He was originally chared with reckless driving. `` I'm glad the court decided that there was no basis for charging me with reckless driving,'' <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>'s statement said. `` There was never any evidence for that charge.

<HEAD>NRC Orders Immediate Suspension Of Use Of Ionizing Air Guns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators on Thursday ordered an immediate suspension of the use of an industrial device which has leaked tiny particles of radioactive polonium at plants around the nation. The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> also ordered the <ORGANIZATION> 3M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to recall for inspection all 45,000 of the suspect devices, ionizing air guns used to control static electricity and remove dust from product containers. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernero </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s office of nuclear materials safety, said that of 828 plants inspected so far, `` detectable'' _ though virtually harmless _ contamination had been found at 118 sites. Of those, he identified 39 plants where the radiation exceeded the reportable limit of .005 microcuries. `` This is an incomplete list,'' said <PERSON> Bernero </PERSON>. `` It changes daily.'' Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> issued successive recalls of particular 3M models used in the food, beverage, cosmetic and drug industries, involving about 2,500 units. The latest order affects all industries and applies to all the devices made since they were first marketed in 1965. Echoing earlier reports, <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday they still have no evidence that the faulty devices have posed any health hazard, either to workers at plants where radioactive contamination was found or to consumers of the products made at those facilities. <PERSON> Bernero </PERSON> said in more than 1,000 tests of product samples, there was only once instance in which radiation was detected, involving a food supplement made by <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Altavista </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. In that case, the amount was so low it could have involved naturally occuring radiation, he said. But he cited another case, involving Moto Photo of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, where he expressed greater concern about what the inspectors do n't know, rather than what they found. That facility is in a shopping mall, he said, and how much of the leaked radioactive material `` might have been tracked out into the mall is just unknown.'' <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said the suspension and broadened recall order was necessary in light of the growing list of plants where inspectors found the devices had failed, leaking microscopic ceramic spheres containing polonium 210, which emits a weak form of radiation incapable of penetrating the skin but which could prove harmful if ingested in sufficient amounts. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said `` we're doing this to ensure there's not the rare gun out there that's leaking a lot more than anything we've found so far.'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, a 3M spokesman, said `` we're certainly going to comply'' with the order. `` In this business you want to react with integrity and ensure confidence,'' he said. At the same time, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> underscored the findings by federal officials that no health hazard appears involved. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> declined to estimate what the recall and inspection order would cost the company, but said it would have no major effect on its overall treasury. Polonium 210, a naturally occuring decay product of radium, emits alpha rays too weak to penetrate the skin. Though it could prove a health threat if inhaled or swallowed in sufficient amounts, authorities say the protective ceramic covering on the material used in the 3M guns should preclude that danger. They say the particles are too heavy to be inhaled, and the leaked material in most cases fell harmlessly to the floor. Even if ingested, the shell, if intact, would pass through the body without harm in two to four days, they say. However, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and others have expressed concern that some of the shell could be crushed or cracked, allowing more radiation to escape. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said that if one of the particles were absorbed, it would yield about 4 rem of radiation. By comparison, the average cigarette smoker absorbs about 6 rem of polonium radiation in a year. <PERSON> Bernero </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> investigators had found evidence in internal 3M records that from 0.04 percent to 0.9 percent of the guns, depending on the model, were faulty, even though the company reported far lower failure rates. By late last week, the government had identified 28 plants were contamination was found. The facilities just added to that list are: <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s paint plant at <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Dial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> microwave lunch packaging plant at Ft.. Madison, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Pro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, maker of plastic cases for computers; the K-Mart film processing plant at <LOCATION> Garland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; the Micro Technology electronic chips plant at <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Body </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; Super Photo of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, and Moto Photo and <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders Thursday dropped <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the outspoken former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief, from the ruling Politburo and promoted officials charged with reforming economic planning and party personnel. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also said a party conference in June would be called on to adopt major political reforms ensuring the rule of law over personal will. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> should devote a future session to the problems of the country's more than 100 nationalities. Ethnic groups in the Baltic republics and elsewhere have been agitating for greater autonomy or outright independence. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency announced the leadership changes at the end of a two-day meeting of about 300 members of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The committee also adopted major educational reforms. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` freed Comrade B.N. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> from his duties as a candidate member of the Politburo,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>, 50, were named candidates, or non-voting members of the Politburo. For the past two years, <LOCATION> Razumovskya </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> protege, has been a secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in charge of appointing party personnel. <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> was named this month to head the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the government body in charge of planning the state-run economy. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> supported <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of greater openness but his criticism apparently went farther than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was willing to allow. On Nov 11, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ousted the strapping, 57-year-old <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> from his position as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party leader. At the last meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on Oct. 21, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> criticized the pace of reform and the leadership style of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He had offered to quit. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was transferred to first deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, with the rank of government minister. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s fate was seen as a test by many in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> of how far <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would carry his policy of allowing greater openness and differences of opinion. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said last January it was a `` delusion'' to view <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s dismissal as a blow to his restructuring policies. He said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was overly ambitious. The Soviet leader gave the clearest indication yet of the problems he wants to attack at the party conference, the first since the 1940s. He said he intends to reform, not replace, the present system, and that the dominance of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is not in question. `` The main problem in developing our political system is to create a mechanism of power and government ... which would drastically diminish and even reduce to naught the element of chance in handling major political, state issues and preclude the possibility of subjectivity at all ` floors' of our political system,'' he said. `` Subjectivity'' was an apparent reference to the personal wills of earlier Soviet leaders such as dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called for strengthening the electoral system, local governing councils and the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament. He called for a sharper distinction between the role of government organizations and party groups, but provided no details. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the only body empowered to make changes in the ruling Politburo, did not touch the list of 13 full voting Politburo members. <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON>'s appointment was a clear victory for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> must have an ally in charge of appointing party personnel in order to overcome the resistance to his reforms in many layers of the vast Soviet bureaucracy. <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>, a defense industry expert, replaced <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Talyzin </PERSON>, who had been criticized by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Talyzin </PERSON> was shunted to chairmanship of a little-known government commission, but kept his candidate status on the Politburo. <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baklanov </PERSON>, 55, minister of general machine building, was chosen to become a secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> the country faces a `` most serious financial problem.'' He said a drop in world commodity prices and the loss of income from alcohol sales due to his campaign against drunkenness had hurt the Soviet economy. The Soviet Union depends on oil and natural gas for a substantial percentage of its export income. He said the top priority is improving food, housing and consumer goods, and said his policies have made progress in those areas. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rejected claims that his reforms are pulling the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> away from socialism. At the same time, he defended his policy of `` glasnost'' or greater openness, and criticized the mistakes of former leaders <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reiterated Soviet criticism of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conservatives and some European leaders for urging the Western alliance to upgrade its weapons systems to make up for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles that will be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Regarding <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the war there long had a `` direct and deep impact on the feelings of Soviet people.'' He said he had been seeking a way out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since he took power almost three years ago. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Feb. 8 the estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers could be pulled out in a 10-month period beginning May 15 if U.N.-sponsored talks can reach an agreement.

<HEAD>Donor Shortage May Force Rethinking on Use of Artificial Hearts As
Bridges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Heart transplantation probably has reached its peak because of a nationwide shortage of donor organs, and that may force doctors to re-evaluate the use of temporary artificial hearts, prominent surgeons said Thursday. Because of complications related to their long-term use, artificial hearts have been used in the past few years strictly to keep patients alive pending the receipt of donor hearts. But at an opening-day session of a conference on thoracic organ transplantation, surgeons discussed the possibility that use of the devices as bridges may have to be reconsidered. `` I think the artificial heart business and circulatory support business is going to become more esoteric until such time as we have a -LRB- totally implantable -RRB- permanent device to put in,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a co-sponsor of the conference with the <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said using a bridge to transplant `` is much less appealing in my mind, with the donor shortage, and many patients sitting around waiting would be better candidates for transplant if there's one organ available and too many waiting for it. So I think it's going to be less common.'' Nearly 200 surgeons and other medical practitioners attended the opening session, which covered a range of topics on heart, heart-lung and lung transplantation. One of them, Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumgartner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, cited a recent study predicting a limit of about 1,500 heart donors annually and said, `` I think that we have proabably reached the zenith of heart transplant donors, at least for the forseeable future.'' <PERSON> Baumgartner </PERSON> last year performed a `` domino donor'' transplant, implanting a heart and lung into a cystic fibrosis patient whose own heart was transplanted into a second patient. The first patient received organs donated by a brain-dead patient. Dr. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> <PERSON> Eales </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We dilute the credibility of our programs if we have 100 people on the waiting list and all we can do is 15 or 20 transplants a year,'' A number of surgeons said there has been a falloff in the number of heart transplants performed so far in 1988 compared with 1987, but could give no explanation. `` We're used to seeing a great deal of variation,'' <PERSON> Eales </PERSON> said. `` But this has been prolonged and it's evidently been nationwide.'' Dr. <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, a cardiovascular surgeon from the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> center and an expert on the <PERSON> Jarvik </PERSON> artificial heart, while agreeing the donor shortage is a `` real problem,'' said he disagreed with the idea that `` perhaps we should n't even consider using the device as a bridge to transplant.'' `` We are at a point in the development of these devices that we need some experience and there is a price we're going to have to pay,'' including losing some patients, he said. He said if not for having moved ahead with such experimental implants as <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s, `` I would daresay that there would be no research going on on a national scale today to develop a total artificial heart.'' But he added that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> has provided $ 20 million a year for such development, and predicted a totally implantable device `` in the near future.'' <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, who worked with Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVries </PERSON> in the early permanent <PERSON> Jarvik </PERSON> implants, said the time may be approaching for a return to permanent artificial hearts. He said the donor shortage likely will force transplant programs to reject older patients as less-than-perfect candidates, in turn again making available a pool of candidates for permanent implants.

<HEAD>House Balks At Senate Effort To Ban Pornographic Phone Services</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House on Wednesday balked at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan to outlaw dial-a-porn telephone services after some members raised constitutional questions and said they had a better way to keep children from calling. The lawmakers voted 382-0 to instruct negotiators on an omnibus education bill _ one that now includes the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ban _ to agree on new provisions aimed at solving the dial-a-porn problem short of an outright ban. The alternative, pressed by some conservatives, would have been to instruct the negotiators to accept the ban. But others argued it would be vulnerable to court challenges based on the right to free speech. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the vote paved the way for a solution involving access codes that would prevent children from calling the pornographic toll numbers unless their subscriber parents gave them the code `` There is uniform concern in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over this problem. We want to get a bipartisan solution,'' said <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on communications. Sponsors of the successful motion said they did n't want to take the risk that the negotiators would drop the whole issue because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ban seemed unconstitutional. And they said they did n't want the negotiators to accept a plan that would result in an immediate court challenge and injunction `` It would be litigated for years before we got a solution,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>. `` And maybe we would get to one we sought, and maybe we would n't. <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON> said the purveyors of dial-a-porn might well go to court anyway, even over access codes, but their cases would be severely weakened without the First Amendment grounds. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, sponsored the dial-a-porn ban last December as an amendment to an education improvement act renewing and expanding federal programs for elementary and secondary school students. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> measure 98-0 despite some senators' reservations about its constitutionality and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s prediction that it would be challenged if it became law. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s negotiating team, praised the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> action Wednesday and promised that `` we will go as far as we can constitutionally to bring to a halt this obnoxious practice. That was not enough for some conservatives, who said neither children nor adults should have access to pornographic messages via their telephones. `` We should be voting here today to eliminate dial-a-porn from the culture of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>. He tried and failed to win a vote on instructing the negotiators to accept the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ban.

<HEAD>Decline in Corn Available to Market Pushing Prices Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A decline in the amount of corn readily available to the market is one reason feed grain prices have edged higher this winter, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is estimated to have around 1.75 billion bushels of corn in its inventory for 1987-88, compared with 1.44 billion bushels last season. In addition, farmers have large quantities of corn still under price support loan _ which can not be sold on the market or used until the loans are settled. If the loans are n't repaid, the grain winds up in CCC inventories. Grain also is held in storage under the `` farmer-owned reserve'' program, or FOR, and can not be released until prices rise to specified levels. `` A key factor in this year's stronger corn and sorghum prices is the commitment of a larger share of the 1987-88 supply to CCC inventory, FOR and regular CCC crop loans, and shrinking uncommitted stocks,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in an outlook report. `` Corn prices have been edging upward in expectation that cash redemptions from loans will be necessary to meet market demands,'' the report said. `` Corn prices received by farmers are expected to average $ 1.65 to $ 1.85 a bushel, up from $ 1.50 in 1986-87.'' Sorghum prices are projected at $ 1.50 to $ 1.70 per bushel, compared with an average of $ 1.37 in the 1986-87 season.

<HEAD>Israel, Egypt Earmarked for Most 1989 Foreign Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> are slated to receive a combined total of $ 5.3 billion in economic and military aid commitments in fiscal 1989 out of a global total of $ 14.3 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> told a news briefing that even though the request to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for spending authority on foreign assistance is up about $ 200 million from the 1988 allocation, many pressing needs will remain unmet. `` It is difficult to operate a foreign policy with such limited funds,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said, noting that the overall international affairs budget has dropped by some 30 per cent since 1985. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> have been given the highest priority in the foreign assistance allocations for years, and 1989 will be no exception. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is scheduled to receive commitments for $ 1.2 billion in economic aid and $ 1.8 billion in military aid while the figures for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> are $ 815 million and $ 1.3 billion respectively. The $ 14.3 billion proposed by the administration would not represent actual 1989 outlays, because some of the money will be spent on projects extending over several years. The outlay figure is expected to be several billion less than the $ 14.3 billion request. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said that of the $ 1.3 billion in military aid proposed for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, only a few million would actually be spent next year and the remainder would be in the pipeline for use in future years. The same holds true for the economic aid program although the percentage of cash outlays are somewhat higher compared with the military program for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the more than 40 aid recipients in sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ the world's poorest region _ are due to receive a combined total of $ 733 million in economic assistance commitments. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said the high assistance levels for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> are based on need, their decision to make peace a decade ago and the wishes of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is very little sympathy in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a reduction,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. He noted that, unlike past years, the global totals are likely to receive congressional approval because they had been agreed to by the congressional leadership late last year. In the past, however, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has earmarked specific amounts for countries it favors, forcing the administraion to make adjustments in the figures for other countries. The administration has strongly opposed congressional earmarkings and <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> expressed hope that lawmakers will exercise restraint when they take up the 1989 proposals. `` Firm earmarkings ... are not a good way to run a railroad,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. Among the few surprises in the proposed country-by-country allocations was the elimination of the program for <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, which is receiving $ 35 million in commitments during the current year. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said the decision to drop <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> from the list was based on the perception that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` does not receive a real return'' on its investment. Irish diplomatic sources expressed hope that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will reinstate the funding. For the past three years, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> has been funneled through the International Fund for <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, in which several countries make contributions. The bulk of the funds have gone for the reconstruction of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, with a small amount earmarked for border counties in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The fund was set up in 1986 for a three-year period but the Irish sources, insisting on anonymity, said a fourth year of allocations had not been ruled out. `` We understand the view of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that they do n't envisage funding beyond the third year, but the matter has to be considered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> where there is strong support for the International Fund,'' an Irish diplomat said The foreign assistance program also: __ Calls for a $ 98 million increase in commitments for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to $ 623.5 million <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s principal rival, would receive a $ 7 million increase. __ Reinstates military grant assistance to eight <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries which have been cut out of the 1988 program All told, Latin American countries would receive $ 90 million more in economic assistance commitments and $ 55 million more in military assistance commitments than they have at present. __ Earmarks $ 32.4 million in assistance commitments _ almost all economic _ to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> even though aid to that country was suspended late last year when the military abrogated election laws <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said the proposed aid to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> would be allocated only if there is progress toward democracy.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, 70, came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> 20 years ago as a hero <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> cop, rising above the poverty of a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> tenement to the lofty halls of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Now, he is fighting expulsion from the House. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee said it would recommend that <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> be ousted, a rare step. He is charged with violating the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s rules for the conduct of a congressman. The 10-term congressman says he wo n't give up his seat without a fight. But the development climaxes a yearlong decline for a once-respected lawmaker. The <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> Democrat's troubles began with his indictments in two separate cases. The first came last March 16. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was charged with accepting paid vacations in exchange for helping to steer government contracts toward Coastal Dry Dock and Repair, an ailing <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> shipyard. At his conviction last Sept. 22, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> scoffed that he had been found guilty of `` tipping.'' But he wept two months later when the judge, calling the case `` a Greek tragedy,'' sentenced <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> to 2 -LCB- years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was forced to relinquish his two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairmanships. The second indictment came June 3, when <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was charged with bribery and rackeeteering in connection with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, the now-infamous <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> military contractor. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> pleaded innocent and faces trial next month. When a cadre of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans threatened to challenge his right to vote. He has refrained from voting ever since. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was born in a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> tenement, the oldest of three sons of immigrants from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. He shined shoes and delivered laundry to supplement the income of his father, a marble-setter, and his mother, a charwoman. After high school, he worked as a foreman in a braid factory until when he got a job as a mailman. He quit in 1942 to join the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. As a policeman, he earned a record 28 bravery citations in 23 years. He received the Police Medal of Honor for Valor after killing a gunman who jumped into a car with him and a friend in an apparent robbery attempt. He was wounded 10 times in the line of duty. To this day, he walks with a cane after being kicked by a runaway horse. In 1960, the dean of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutman </PERSON>, heard <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> speak at a dinner and was so impressed that he offered <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, by then a police detective, a full scholarship to study law. With <PERSON> Gutman </PERSON>'s help, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> obtained a dispensation from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> waiving the requirement for a college degree. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> completed law school in 2 -LCB- years while on leave from his police duties. He retired from the police department in 1965 as a detective lieutenant and was granted a 75 percent disability pension. In 1966, he helped found a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> law firm which now employs his son <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, who has also been indicted in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> case. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> won election to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1968 with 60 percent of the vote and has not faced serious political opposition in the past decade. Combining a dedication to community service, support for federal spending for those in need, and outspokenness on such issues as Soviet-Jewish emigration and the conflict in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> won the loyalty of the large Irish, Italian and Jewish blocs in his district. But in 1973, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> mounted a campaign for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> mayor that nearly destroyed him politically. During the race, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> denied reports that he had taken the Fifth Amendment before a grand jury investigation allegations of payoffs to congressmen who sponsored certain immigration legislation. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> sued to get some, but not all, of the grand jury records made public. The idea backfired when the judge released all the minutes, proving that <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> had lied and had taken the Fifth. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> then launched an investigation, and <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> acknowledged that he had been questioned by another grand jury looking into whether a judge involved in a case tied to <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s law firm had been bribed. No charges were brought in either case.

<TEXT>
 Deputy Chancellor <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, head of the party that backed <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> for the presidency, stuck by him Thursday but the party itself did not make a statement of support after a leadership caucus. Mock also is foreign minister of the coalition government, in which his conservative <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is the junior partner of Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzy </PERSON>'s Socialists. <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> has indicated <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> should resign because of questions about his conduct as a German army lieutenant in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> during World War II. Other political leaders ranging from Socialist to conservative have also suggested <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> step down. Opinion polls this week have shown declining support for the president, who on Monday rejected demands that he resign because of the report a government-appointed commission of historians prpared on his war service. It said he was in `` close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities, knew of them and did nothing to stop them. The historians said they found no proof that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> committed war crimes, but they left the question of guilt open. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, now 69, has consistently denied wrongdoing since allegations about his war service first appeared in March 1986 during the presidential campaign. The government named the international panel of historians at <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s request in September, after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> put the former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general on a `` watch list'' of undesirable aliens that barred him from the country. After the party leadership caucus Thursday, <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s decision to stay in office `` should be respected by all democrats. A source who attended the meeting said privately that prominent conservatives other than Mock believe <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> must go. A statement issued after the meeting did not explicitly declare <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> support for <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, indicating disagreement among its leaders. Economics Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Graf </PERSON>, a conservative who has indicated <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> should resign, said he did not attend the party meeting. Asked how <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s political crisis should be solved, he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` The decision lies with the president.'' Mock would not tell reporters whether <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was criticized in the meeting. He urged political parties to quit discussing the matter, contending that more talk would `` endanger trust in political institutions.'' He accused the state radio-television monopoly <ORGANIZATION> ORF </ORGANIZATION> of `` brainwashing'' of the public against <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. `` The reporting of ORF is scandalous ... one-sided and unobjective,'' he said. Mock would not cite cases, but said in response to questions: `` There is a whole list of things where brainwashing of the public has been going on for weeks.'' <PERSON> Thaddeus </PERSON> <PERSON> Podgorski </PERSON>, head of the network, issued a statement saying the reporting conformed with regulations governing broadcasting. <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON>, who is in charge of information at <ORGANIZATION> ORF </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement later saying: `` The <ORGANIZATION> ORF </ORGANIZATION> correspondents were expressly ordered to include in their reports especially reactions positive for the president. It does not lie within the responsibility of ORF that foreign reactions were overwhelmingly negative.'' The government rejected a call by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION>'s parliament for <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> to be forced from office and tried for war crimes. The Foreign Ministry expressed `` <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s indignation'' over the resolution passed unanimously by the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said in rejecting the resolution that `` wholesale judgments and accusations of that kind'' would not serve anyone.

 Moslem militiamen searched rain-drenched citrus groves and valley caves Thursday for Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, and their leaders threatened to go after his kidnappers unless the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> is freed soon. `` We want <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> back and we have no red line as far as his case is concerned,'' said <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> of the moderate Shiite militia Amal, the dominant force around the ancient port of Tyre. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops and about 1,500 Amal militiamen virtually sealed off a 300-square-mile area. An anonymous telephone caller claimed responsibility for Wednesday's abduction in the name of a previously unknown group. He claimed <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who commands <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> truce observers in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, is a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> denied Thursday that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> had any <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> connections: `` There was a claim that Lt. Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was associated with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. That is not true.'' The abduction brings the number of foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to 25, including nine Americans. Most are believed held by pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremists, whose main <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militia has been challenging Amal's dominance in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. An Arabic-speaking man said in the telephone call to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that he represented the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades, and declared: `` <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> has joined the hostages. He will only come out after he is tried on grounds that he is one of the directors of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is now out of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after he was brought out from the south.'' He said a statement and photograph of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> would be released soon. There was no way to authenticate the claim. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a 43-year-old native of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, heads the 76-member observer group attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the peacekeeping force in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> known as <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>. Officers under his command represent 16 nations. <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> is military commander of <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, the Shiite militia led by Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>. He said in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>: `` We're capable of confronting the people who've carried out the abduction if need be, but I hope a quick, happy ending will be accomplished. He and senior aides told reporters they believed <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and the captors still were in an area southeast of Tyre, which is 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` We do not have any reason to believe that he is out of the south,'' <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said at headquarters in <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>, just north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border. When <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was seized, he was violating <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> rules for travel by Americans in dangerous areas, <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said, but the colonel `` felt he could n't abide by these restrictions. ... <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> felt that as chief, he should be out with his men and know what they are doing.'' American members of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces are restricted to the headquarters area and are permitted to travel in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> only with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military escort, he said. An Amal spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: `` Despite heavy rain, the search has been completed in areas north and east of Tyre. We are focusing now on <LOCATION> Wadi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jilo </LOCATION> southeast of Tyre.'' <LOCATION> Wadi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jilo </LOCATION>, six miles southeast of Tyre, is a stronghold of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be an umbrella for factions holding most of the captive foreigners. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, abducted March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' father died Thursday in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, of congestive heart failure. The family learned of the abduction while trying notify the Marine officer that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was near death. <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> and his aides met at a Lebanese army barracks in Tyre with <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> officers led by Lt. Col. Tor Planting of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> to coordinate the search effort. `` We hope the kidnappers will have no chance of slipping out with their captive,'' the Amal spokesman said. Cars manned by plainclothes <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> security men blocked roads along the <LOCATION> Litani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast to the slopes of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> about 25 miles inland. Uniformed militiamen with submachine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers patrolled a 12-mile stretch of coast from the <LOCATION> Qassmieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> north of Tyre to the kidnap scene three miles south of the city, the spokesman said. `` Our men are searching villages in an 800-square-kilometer -LRB- 300-square - mile -RRB- area north, east and south of Tyre,'' he said `` <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops block the southern exits of the region.'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> has issued orders that `` no one sleeps until we get the man -LRB- <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> -RRB- back,'' the spokesman said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> is `` anxious to protect and safeguard <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, regardless of the nationality of the peacekeepers. Amal views <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction as a deliberate challenge.'' <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> operates in predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> areas frequently caught in the crossfire of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s battles with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremists loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Security sources said French <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officers had interviewed a Lebanese bus driver who claimed he saw the abduction from a few yards away. `` The Frenchmen have managed to draw a face sketch of the gunman the eyewitness says he saw pointing his pistol to <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' head as he forced him into the kidnappers' car,'' one said. Officials have said two gunmen in a <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> kidnapped <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> after blocking his car on a coastal highway. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was the third U.N official kidnapped in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in three weeks. The other two, a Swede and Norwegian of the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, were seized Feb. 5 near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, midway between Tyre and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 World chess champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> will join 31 leading chess masters to compete for the record $ 75,000 World Blitz Championship in Saint <PERSON> John </PERSON> on Friday and Saturday. The event features a series of duels in which each player's thinking time will be limited to five minutes per game `` Its going to be outrageous. It will vanquish once and for all the idea that chess is a boring game,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, a 26-year-old International Master from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The series of four game knockouts will culminate Saturday in a six-game grand finale. Most experts are predicting a clash between <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> and his archrival, fellow Soviet <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>. It would be their first meeting since their world title duel ended in a 12-12 tie in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, last December, leaving <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> as champion. Other observers suggest the frantic pace of the games will increase the likelihood of an American or West European grandmaster's pulling off a giant-killing victory. While the 10-week <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> contest featured a total prize fund of $ 1.85 million, the victor in Saint <PERSON> John </PERSON> will walk away with $ 37,500 for four hours work, the highest first prize ever in a single tournament. `` It's a completely different kind of chess, but I think it's very exciting for the public You need to concentrate for every second because of the speed,'' said <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, 36, at a news conference Thursday. Spectators will be able to watch the play unfold using a special, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> - made computer called an Intelligent chess display Using sensors in the board and pieces, the moves will be instantaneously transmitted onto video screens throughout the hall. `` Such events are part of the future of chess, they are like an electric shock,'' the 24-year-old titleholder told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Of course, this kind of contest would n't have been possible without the new technology,'' <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> added. <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION>, the sports cable network based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, plans to broadcast three one-hour programs on the event. `` We are trying to use the same broadcast technology used in other sports, like split screens and extra close-ups, with the exception of slow motion replays,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Allies </PERSON>, an executive producer with Toronto-based Tier One Communications, which is producing the programs. A 12-man World Swift championship, played under similar conditions last April in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, was won by <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>. Dutch Grandmaster <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> came in second, with <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> third. Players reached this final through qualifiers held earlier in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Biel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and in Saint <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a city of 125,000 on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s eastern seaboard. The blitz championship is the showcase finale of the World Chess Festival, billed as the greatest chess spectacular ever held in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The monthlong event has attracted more than 700 players from 26 countries. It will be <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>'s first appearance in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. On Sunday, the titlist will travel with his British manager, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a four-day tour, including a display at a school in the city's poor south <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> district and an exhibition match against celebrities. `` The blitz is the kind of event to increase the popularity of the game. I hope my visit will help to promote chess throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Judge Upholds Denial Of Patent For Controversial Electric Device</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Wednesday upheld the government's refusal to grant a patent for an electrical motor which its inventor claims produces a net gain of energy but whose critics say violates a basic law of physics. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> found there was no valid scientific evidence to support inventor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s claims that his device produced more energy than it consumed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made his ruling on a 5-year-old lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which had refused to grant a patent after examiners determined that the machine did not do what <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> claimed it could do. The Patent Office, which did n't conduct tests, ruled that <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> was seeking a patent for a perpetual motion machine, a concept that violates the second law of thermodynamics. The law of physics states that in any mechanical process some energy is inevitably lost, usually in the form of heat, so that output can not exceed the input of energy. The judge said <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, an inventor from <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, produced evidence that was `` anecdotal and largely qualitative rather than quantified measured data'' to support his theory. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also found that <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> failed to rebut the findings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION>, which tested the machine and found `` the device did not deliver more energy than it used.'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> claims that his machine, which largely resembles an ordinary electric motor except for an unusually large coil of wire, converts what he calls `` gyroscopic particles'' into energy. The 51-year-old inventor has demonstrated his device to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee and to news reporters in several cities. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> found that `` aside from <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s own somewhat metaphysical writings which appear at multiple points throughout his patent application there is no evidence whatsoever ... from which to find the existence of such ` gyroscopic particles,' their observable -LRB- or measurable -RRB- ` release' or ` reaction' within the device.'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON>, said they expected to file an appeal of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s decision to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here. `` The procedure in the Patent Office was unfair and we think the testing procedure was unfair,'' <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> said, referring to the tests conducted two years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had improperly rejected the findings of former patent commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuyler </PERSON>, a court-appointed expert, who reported there was clear evidence that <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s device worked. `` We have an expert ... who agrees with our view and we have a district court judge's opinion that differs with that. So I think we will have to go the Court of Appeals for a tie-breaker,'' <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and patent officials of bias, charging they knew his invention would hurt oil companies. `` I am pleased the judge has finally ruled because I am counting on getting up to the higher court,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. But `` I do n't expect any justice from those people. The often acrimonious court battle included an incident in 1986 when <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> was cited for contempt of court for pressing <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s claim that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> recuse himself because he was appointed to the federal bench by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` I have had just about enough of your insolence in this case,'' the judge told <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> later withdrew the contempt citation.

 In another sign of eroding support for the Austrian president, a leading industrialist has suggested that <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> step down because of the controversy over his World War II record. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Krejci </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrialists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the fate of the country is even more important than the office'' of president. Vice Chancellor <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, at a news conference Wednesday, rejected as `` not important'' <PERSON> Krecji </PERSON>'s remarks, made a day earlier on national television. <PERSON> Krejci </PERSON> is a member of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is headed by Mock and which backed <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> for president in 1986. The chancellor runs the government and the presidency is a largely ceremonial post in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>.

The national leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled a meeting Thursday at which it is expected to discuss the <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> case. Last week, a commission of historians questioned <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s moral integrity, saying he was `` in close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities when he served as a lieutenant in the German army during World War II, but did nothing about them Though the panel said it found no evidence <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> had committed war crimes, it concluded he tried to cover up his involvement in the war, which was disclosed nearly two years ago during the presidential campaign. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, 69, a former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, has said he is innocent of wrongdoing and has refused to resign. The tabloid Kurier, which represents the conservative party's relatively liberal economic and business wing, has said at least twice in the past week that the party is weighing a plan to put more pressure on <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> to resign It did not describe the plan.

 A prominent forensic psychiatrist testifying Thursday in a $ 22.5 million lawsuit brought against Soldier of Fortune by a murder victim's family said a classified ad in the magazine led to the slaying. `` In my opinion, the advertisement was a proximate cause of death for <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON>, who headed the forensic team that evaluated <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> after he shot President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981, said Soldier of Fortune was the magazine of choice for people who looked through its classifieds for people willing to engage in illegal activity. In earlier testimony Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Soldier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fortune </ORGANIZATION> publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he was unaware of news reports linking classified ads in the magazine to criminal acts before a killer was hired through the ads. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, in a second day of testimony in federal court, said if he had known of the reports he might have eliminated the advertisements. `` I would have conducted an investigation to see if it was an aberration or a pattern,'' he said. `` If we could have developed a pattern, then I would have discontinued the ads.'' A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> family is accusing the Colorado-based magazine of negligence for running an ad that is linked to a woman's 1985 slaying. The magazine bills itself as the journal of professional adventurers. The ad placed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> brought him together with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> and led to the murder-for-hire of <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. Black is on death row for paying <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> $ 10,000 to carry out the killing. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> is serving three life terms for murder. <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Einmann </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s mother, and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, the victim's 18-year-old son, are seeking $ 2.5 million in actual damages and $ 20 million in punitive damages. Attorneys for the magazine do not dispute the ad brought <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> and Black together, but insist <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had no way of knowing the ad was for illegal activity. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON>'s ad, which appeared in four issues in late 1984, sought <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and weapons specialists with jungle warfare expertise for `` high-risk assignments'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or overseas. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> said in a deposition read into testimony Wednesday that his ad was intended to attract bodyguard and security work. He said it brought responses from people looking for help with bombings, assaults, jail breaks and killings. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he had not read in Denver-area newspapers about an extortion indictment linking the magazine's ads in May 1984 to a so-called `` collection agency'' allegedly involved in kidnap, extortion and death threats. Numerous stories about the extortion ring were run in 1984, but <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he may have been out of the area at the time or did n't see them <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also denied Thursday that an advertising policy adopted in May 1984 was in response to police inquiries about crimes that may have been linked to classified ads in the magazine. The policy established for the first time since the magazine began in 1975 a formal rejection procedure for classified ads. `` It was a matter of setting policy to preclude events that might happen,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` One of the motives was to upgrade the image of the magazine.'' The policy listed about a dozen reasons why a classified ad could be rejected, including any suggestion an ad would `` encourage illegal activity.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> acknowledged that continued publication of personal services ads had been discussed at the magazine for years and that he may have been the only person at Soldier of Fortune to favor their continuation. He has said that the magazine was aimed at <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and that the classified ads were run as a source of employment for them.

<HEAD>Arab League Calls For Assembly on U.S. Bid to Close PLO Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday demanded an emergency session of the 159-nation <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to discuss <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans to close the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> mission. The 21-nation league wants the assembly to `` shield'' the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s observer mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said a league spokesman, <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> He was vague about how the assembly might accomplish this. `` We can not recommend at this moment a specific course of action,'' he told reporters. But if an emergency session was held, it is expected the assembly would denounce the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and say it violated the treaty under which it is host to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are not seeking or eliciting a confrontation,'' <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> insisted. `` We are seeking that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abide by its treaty obligations.'' The request came in a letter to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ambassador, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Florin </PERSON>, who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Florin </PERSON> is expected to approve the request, said diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which enjoys strong support at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> diplomats have said they may ask the assembly to move to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> if the mission is closed. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had said the treaty obliged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to let the mission operate. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a law ordering the mission closed by March 22. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist organization. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> now must decide on whether to close the mission. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Thursday that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was expected to announce his decision near the end of March. Several congressmen have said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> assured them he would close the mission. <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> wants the assembly to begin its session no later than Feb. 29. During its regular session, which ended in December, the assembly overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to leave the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission alone. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was the only country to vote against the measure and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abstained. <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could avoid a confrontation with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> if the law is repealed or if the administration refuses to enforce it. Both possibilities seem unlikely. The legislation had strong support in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the measure last Dec. 22, despite the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s reservations. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission is the only <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> closed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> information office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last year.

 Former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> abandoned his bid for the Republican presidential nomination Thursday after losing badly in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` You listened, considered and chose,'' he said. `` I could not have asked for more.'' <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> withdrew just six days after <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> gave up his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidacy, leaving four Republicans in the 1988 race. Former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> dropped out earlier Thursday, leaving six Democrats. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, 53, a former congressman and state legislator as well as governor, is a great-great grandson of the founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Despite his efforts and the familiarity of his name, his candidacy never attracted widespread support in the 17 months after he announced his presidential plans. He had hoped to make himself the conservative alternative to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> front-runners <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, but he finished far down in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> on Tuesday, he won his only two delegates, finishing a distant fourth behind conservative Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> though slightly ahead of former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. He said Thursday he would n't endorse another candidate immediately. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, told reporters accompanying the vice president to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had received a call from du Pont on Air Force Two. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> described the conversation as `` very friendly'' and quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as telling the former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> governor: `` <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>, I've been there myself <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and I wish you and your family the very best.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> described the rest of the 10-minute conversation as `` private'' although he said the two voiced `` a general willingness to talk at some time in the future.'' Asked what they would talk about, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said it would involve the possibility of du Pont endorsing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying `` it's an interest we would have. ... I believe whe phone call was simply to let the vice president know he was withdrawing from the race.'' In his withdrawal announcement _ made to about 100 supporters, many wearing `` Pete 1992'' stickers _ du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said, `` Today our campaign lowers its flag, but our crusade continues to march.'' `` You have given me the opportunity of a lifetime,'' he said, thanking his supporters for their efforts in his behalf. `` In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> we do not promise that everyone wins, only that everyone has the opportunity to try. You have given me the opportunity,'' he said. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> took note of his controversial stands on such issues as mandatory drug testing for high school students and elimination of farm subsidies. `` We have moved those challenges forward to the center of the debate; they are urgent, they are real, they will not disappear,'' he said. `` Neither will our efforts to address them. All of us can pause to catch our breath; none of us should think it time to end our quest.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s press secretary, said in a telephone interview that financing was a major consideration in the withdrawal decision. He said the candidate would `` not run a deficit campaign.'' <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> raised $ 7.5 million and was left with $ 350,000 after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. But the campaign would have faced large expenses to carry on through the 20-state Super Tuesday contests March 8. `` We're solvent right now and we have enough money to run the campaign for another two weeks. Unlike some of the campaigns, we're meeting our payroll,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s conservative credentials were polished by his endorsement from the Union Leader newspaper of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> N.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> declared his candidacy Sept. 16, 1986, making him officially the first Republican in the field. `` I'm in a wonderful position,'' he said at the time. `` I'm unknown I'm underrated, and there's nowhere to go but up.'' That same day, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> took off for <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, N.H. In an interview later that week with the <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> News-Journal, he said if he did not do well in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, he would pull out of the race. On Thursday, he was true to his word. Being first to announce, he drew national attention, particularly for his provocative stands on several issues, including drug testing, creation of a private alternative to Social Security modeled after <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> accounts, and the replacement of welfare with a mandatory jobs program. Thursday evening, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> thanked several hundred supporters for their help during a farewell campaign party at a local high school. `` All of us are here tonight to celebrate what for me has been the greatest opportunity of my lifetime,'' he said. `` Now some of you are tired and you deserve to rest. And some of you are sad and you're not allowed to be sad because this is not a sad occasion,'' du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said. `` This is a celebration of a campaign for the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was run the way campaigns ought to be run, on principles, on issues.''

 `` You're a liar!'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s wife screamed at a prosecutor Thursday as the year-long Nazi war crimes trial of the retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker ended. `` Shame on you! Shame on you! You have no heart!'' <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> shouted. Mrs. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 63, her daughter, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>, and son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, mounted the stage of the converted movie theater where the trial was held to confront prosecutors. Security guards pushed the sobbing women out of the courtroom. The sounds of a scuffle could be heard followed by an angry expletive from <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 67, appeared startled but did not otherwise react. The Ukrainian-born defendant is accused of being `` Ivan the Terrible,'' a brutal guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> insists he is an innocent victim of mistaken identity. He was stripped of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship in 1981 and later extradited to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stand trial for war crimes. Holocaust survivor <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON> also interrupted the session, tearfully waving an aging photograph of his parents and three brothers and sister who were killed at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>. `` I was among the dead, and I am here in court today. The -LRB- defense -RRB- lawyers are liars,'' sobbed <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>, 63, who said he escaped death by jumping from the train transporting his family to <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>. The three-judge panel is expected to issue its verdict in April. The proceeding, which began Feb. 16, 1987, was the first war crimes trial in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> mastermind <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON> was convicted and hanged in 1962. The lengthy proceedings were broadcast live on television and radio. Initially, spectators waited hours in line for seats, but interest waned and the final session was sparsely attended. The <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> family's emotional outburst came after defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> ended his final arguments, and prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaked </PERSON> rose to respond to accusations that the prosecution withheld documents that could exonerate <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shaked </PERSON> said the prosecution had given all material to the defense `` on a silver platter,'' and even translated it. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 22, rose angrily from his front row seat, walked onto the stage, turned and said: `` You're a liar.'' He was followed by Mrs. <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>, 28, who shook her fist and screamed: `` You're lying! You're lying!'' before bursting into tears. Mrs. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> then rose, and in a heavily accented voice shaking with emotion, shouted: `` You're a liar! You liar! Shame on you! Shame on you! You have no heart _ nothing!'' She was pulled from the stage by two security guards. After the family's outburst, presiding Judge <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shaked </PERSON> and the defense team: `` You both ought to do away with this bitterness because ... we believe there was fair treatment.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s family said they did not believe he received a fair trial. `` They've been lying from the beginning, and they're ending with a lie,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tearfully after the trial, her hands shaking. `` We did n't expect the trial to end like that, with statements that are n't true. The defense should have been the ones to have the last say,'' she said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the family believed statements from 21 camp survivors who did not identify <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> as `` Ivan'' had been withheld by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and the prosecution had not intervened to help. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s purpose has been to educate young Israelis about the Holocaust and if they were to acquit my dad, that would not serve their purpose,'' he said. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> has been plagued throughout the trial by a poor defense. He fired <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, his attorney of seven years, midway through the proceedings. Several defense witnesses were discredited, including one who retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide after her credentials were called into question during cross-examination. Resting the defense case, <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> called on judges to recognize the prosecution had not `` presented the proof necessary to convict this innocent man.'' `` We have presented evidence sufficient to destroy the prosecution case,'' <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s life is in your hands.'' According to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law, both the verdict and sentence are reached by a majority vote of the three judges. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said the date of the verdict would be announced 10 days in advance. If <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is convicted, a separate sentencing hearing will be held about one month after the verdict. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> could be sentenced to death. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Chumak </PERSON> apologized for comparing the proceedings with the case in which <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfus </PERSON>, a Jewish officer in the French army, was falsely convicted of treason at the beginning of this century. <PERSON> Chumak </PERSON> told the court Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> was convicted `` on the basis of false documents in a wave of anti-Semitism. Paralleling this with anti-Ukrainism, this trial has all the earmarks of the Dreyfus trial.'' Dreyfus was later exonerated. On Thursday, <PERSON> Chumak </PERSON> said he `` meant no criticism or disrespect whatsoever to this honorable court. If there were any such inference that anyone could draw, then of course I apologize unhesitatingly.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday called the Super Tuesday series of Republican presidential primaries a crucial campaign showdown, and said: `` I intend to win.'' Capping the first day of his campaign in the southern and border states which hold primaries and caucuses on March 8, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an enthusiastic crowd, `` There is no way you can become president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by not doing well, if not winning, on Super Tuesday.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described what's at stake as he concluded a campaign foray into <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> with a return to his adopted home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> country,'' Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> told hundreds of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters massed in the flag-bedecked atrium of the <ORGANIZATION> Loews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anatole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> touted <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s record in asking <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> voters to give a chance to carry on the legacy that `` the president and I'' have established over the last seven years. `` We've come a long way under the Reagan-Bush administration,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> audience. `` The question now is, who is best qualified to carry on.'' Earlier, in <LOCATION> Friestatt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, he surprised customers at a truck stop and told one woman: `` Thought you were going to have a quiet cup of coffee, did n't you?'' After visiting several people in the <LOCATION> Tin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lizzie </LOCATION> restaurant at <ORGANIZATION> Sto </ORGANIZATION>'s Auto and Truck Plaza, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> carried a cup of coffee himself _ he ordered a small, but got a large _ as he returned to his limousine to continue campaigning. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his drive for the Republican presidential nomination, has repeatedly advertised his loyalty to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, he gave more emphasis to this part of his basic campaign pitch Thursday. `` I am proud to have stood with this president through thick and through thin, and in good times and bad times, next to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, without cutting and running,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has remained neutral in the race for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, although he is widely believed to privately favor <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> reiterated earlier this week that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plans to stay out of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominating process. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he was surprised by the size of his victory over Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary Tuesday, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got 38 percent of the vote to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s 29 percent. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he could not `` crow about'' elections of the past as he concentrates on the balloting still ahead. <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> is among the states with events in the crucial round of Super Tuesday voting March 8. As he campaigned in the state, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kept his promise to resume the grass-roots campaign style he began after he finished behind <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in the Feb. 8 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> precinct caucuses. `` Many things have improved since the president and I took office,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a crowd at an elementary school in <LOCATION> Monett </LOCATION>. On the same day that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a proposed $ 1.09 trillion budget envisioning a $ 129.5 billion deficit for fiscal 1989 which begins Oct. 1, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeated his own proposal for a four-year budget freeze. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, however, that his spending freeze would make allowances for the rate of inflation and would not `` freeze in'' expenditures which should go. Asked as he arrived in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> whether he needed a `` truth squad'' to check out his statements about <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` I do n't think so. I'm telling the truth. I had n't heard about that. I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing here _ get the message out, fight hard. Feel comfortable on the turf.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of running ads in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> which distorted the senator's position on several issues. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, some Republican senators supporting <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said they would go to the Super Tuesday primary states to present what they termed a clear and unequivocal picture of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s record. `` We're not going to attack anyone,'' Sen. <PERSON> Wrren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, told reporters who asked if they would criticize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his statements about <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s voting record. <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said, however, that during the late days of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaign, some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ads criticizing <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s record were `` a misstatement of his record.'' Rep. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, R-Mo., accompanying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the flight to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, said he thinks <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s standing in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> will benefit <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` We've had a great upswing in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>.

He also said he told the vice president he did not think negative advertising would be useful. Without mentioning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by name, Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, said `` to say that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has been anything but a tax-cutter, a deficit-cutter and a fiscal conservative is simply wrong.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he would honor his commitment to take part in Friday night's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate debate here, despite the fact that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> have said they will not participate. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> event would be a `` pep rally'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Snapp </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> campaign `` did not believe the format would provide a fair and equitable discussion of the issues.''

 A toxic chemical spill snaking its way toward <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> on Thursday forced the evacuation of hundreds of people and fouled drinking water for at least 22,000 along the <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. At least three people were treated for injuries after an estimated 100,000 gallons of toluene, an octane enhancer, spilled Wednesday from a ruptured <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> pipeline south of here. Five hundred people, including 300 residents of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION>, 10 miles to the south, were evacuated Wednesday and Thursday because of the fumes. `` It could get worse,'' said <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Gangwer </PERSON>. `` It depends on how slow it moves, and it's slowing down rapidly.'' The spill reached Fremont late Thursday, and the city stopped pumping water from the river, officials said. They estimated a 14-mile section of the river was contaminated; the river was flowing at about 1 mph. Officials fear the spill killed up to 1,000 fish, many of them under ice, in <LOCATION> Sugar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and could affect waterfowl, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a wildlife officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> declared a state of emergency for <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes Fremont. The declaration makes state assistance available. About 4 million gallons of water, one day's normal supply, was put in reserve tanks before the spill arrived, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathfelder </PERSON>, assistant superintendent of Fremont's water plant. Toluene is a flammable chemical that can produce irritating or poisonous gases, according to an emergency response guidebook published by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. The spill was detected around 6 p.m. Wednesday after <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> workers noticed that pressure had dropped in the pipeline, which carries the chemical from a Sun oil refinery in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> to a refinery in <LOCATION> Marcus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Elam </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the chemical spilled in a swampy area in <LOCATION> Seneca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, population 22,000, and then leaked into <LOCATION> Sugar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, a tributary of the <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> flows north into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of here. Ms. <PERSON> Elam </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> workers were building a road into the swampy area and setting up a dike to contain the chemical. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnet </PERSON>, an environmental safety coordinator for the <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, Okla.-based Sun Pipe Line, said authorities had not located the leak. `` It's been shut off, but it's still leaking,'' <PERSON> Arnet </PERSON> said. Neither EPA nor Sun officials could estimate how much of the chemical had entered the <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Two emergency workers were treated at <ORGANIZATION> Tiffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after they fell through ice and into contaminated water, while a volunteer firefighter was treated after inhaling the fumes. All were subsequently released. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a corporate spokesman for Sun, said the company would take `` liability and responsibility for the leak.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, operations manager for <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, said the source of the leak was an 18-inch split in the pipeline, which is buried 3 -LCB- feet deep and carries the chemical from northwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to a refinery in <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. The cleanup could cost as much as $ 1 million and last three to four months, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said they believed much of the chemical would dissipate by the time it reaches <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, environmental coordinator for the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not expect lasting environmental problems, but added, `` I expect quite a bit of environmental impact on <LOCATION> Sugar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>.'' `` It's not the kind of stuff you want in a river,'' he said. `` It wo n't kill you, but you do n't want to be around it for too long.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> launched a campaign Thursday against what it called an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to force a strike at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and transfer its operations to non-unionized <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries. The 14.3 million-member federation's industrial union department said it has established a citizen's commission to hold hearings on a `` campaign of abuse'' against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 22,550 unionized workers and `` steady deterioration of service and safety standards'' since <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> acquired it two years ago. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union representing some 12,000 Eastern mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground personnel have been in mediation since November after declaring an impasse on the airline's demand for a new round of wage concessions. In the meantime, the company has attempted to spin off its Northeast air shuttle linking <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> _ a move contested in court by the union _ and made extensive preparations to continue operating in anticipation of a strike as early as April 1. `` Eastern has steadily increased work pressures and economic pressures on its employees with the clear intention of forcing a strike,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Recruitment of strikebreakers in the midst of negotiations leaves no doubt that it -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- intends to repeat the all-out union-busting effort that it carried out after seizing <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, when it cynically exploited the bankruptcy laws to abrogate its union contracts,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, head of the federation's industrial union department, said the citizen panel's hearings and demonstrations planned in Eastern hub cities _ <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> _ are intended to put public pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s debtholders to get Eastern to settle with the Machinists. A boycott was rejected as `` playing right into his -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s -RRB- hands to destroy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> said. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the unions' public relations campaign will only backfire. `` The intent is to cause further deterioration in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s already serious financial condition,'' he said `` If such a self-defeating and destructive campaign were to be successful, the economic impact would unquestionably have a serious and detrimental effect on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 32,500 employees.'' Eastern, which reported a net loss of $ 181.1 million in 1987, is demanding $ 265 million in concessions from the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> over the next two years. For some, that would mean wage and benefit cuts of up to 48 percent, union officials said. Contracts with two other unions representing the airline's 3,550 pilots and 7,000 flight attendants also come up for renewal in July and December, respectively. The company last year told them it needs concessions totaling $ 185 million from the two groups. <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> said the citizen's panel will be chaired by <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and includes among its members former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirtz </PERSON>; the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A biotechnology company said Wednesday it has developed a 95 percent accurate method of determining the sex of calves in the embryo. `` This embryo-sexing technique makes it possible to control the composition of the herd,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Granada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The technique involves removing a few cells from the cow embryo and examining them with a gene probe capable of detecting the Y chromosome, which is present only in male cells and indicates a male embryo, the company said. Embryos designated male or female can then be shipped to clients for transplantation, the company said. Producing cattle of the desired sex has obvious advantages to dairy farmers, who need only females, <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said. Because of widespread use of artificial insemination, one bull can sire thousands of calves.

<HEAD>Debris From Russian Rocket Expected to Hit Earth Saturday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Soviet rocket exploded before reaching orbit this week, and debris believed to be from the blast landed off <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, with another chunk expected to hit <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Saturday, a defense official said. `` We are trying to identify it and project an entry area. We ca n't do that right now ... but should get that sometime tomorrow morning,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollie </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Thursday. One chunk, believed to have been a foundation piece that held three satellites to a Soviet Proton rocket launched sometime this week, came down off the southern coast of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hollie </PERSON> said. A second piece wo n't make it past the earth's atmosphere, but a third being tracked by <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be too big to burn up before hitting <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hollie </PERSON> said. `` They may or may not be related to the <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> launch by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hollie </PERSON> said. `` We are not saying they are or are not. The problem we have is they never made it into orbit. The rocket blew up before it attained orbit.'' <PERSON> Hollie </PERSON> said it's `` hard to say right now'' if the debris poses any danger. `` We do n't know exactly how big the piece is,'' he said, but added that it is bigger than the piece that hit near <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` Because of the low orbit, it is very hard for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Space Command to track it,'' <PERSON> Hollie </PERSON> said. The Space Command, also located near <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, tracks satellites, rockets and space debris. <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION> tracks of bombers and missiles.

 A baby born with most of his brain missing and kept on life-support systems to preserve his organs for transplant was pronounced brain dead Thursday, and a search was under way for compatible organ recipients. The 7-pound child known as Baby Boy <PERSON> John </PERSON> remained on life-support systems at <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday afternoon, officials said. The infant suffered from anencephaly, which kills most babies within days. Four babies whose blood type matched that of Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> were known to need livers, and they were being evaluated for transplant, said Dr. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON>, <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> chief of neonatology. No other cases in which anencephalics have been kept on life-support for organ transplant have been announced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, although Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, chief of <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>'s heart transplant program, last year suggested there have been such infants. Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> was born Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> and transferred to <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> has pioneered infant heart transplants. `` By 9 o'clock last evening our clinical criteria for brain death were met,'' Ms. <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON> said. She added that a neurologist unconnected with <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> confirmed the brain death Thursday. The organs of anencephalic babies can be transplanted only if organ damage is prevented by maintaining the infants on life-support. <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s parents, who asked not to be identified, had wanted other babies to receive his organs. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> maintained the infant on life-support under guidelines developed last year after a woman pregnant with an anencephalic child waged a nationwide campaign to find a hospital that would consent to keep the baby on life-support until the organs could be donated. However, the baby was stillborn. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> guidelines call for doctors to use machines to keep the organs of anencephalic infants functioning for up to seven days, then disconnect life-support and let the baby die if brain death has n't occurred. The procedure was denounced by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which accused <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> of going beyond prevailing medical ethics. `` It is an outrage to see how <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> has bulldozed ahead in anencephalic experiments,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, the group's Western director He called for a halt to further use of organs from anencephalics. `` We are confronted with the very real possibility that body parts will be taken from live children,'' he said. One of the hospital's 13 heart transplant patients under age 4 received the heart of an anencephalic baby earlier this year, but the donor child was in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> set off a medical controversy in 1984 when he transplanted the heart of a baboon into an infant known as Baby Fae. She died 20 days later.

 A man who had confessed a role in the slaying of the country's most prominent human rights activist recanted Thursday and said he had been drugged and abused in jail. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, 19, retracted his confession in a writ filed by his lawyers in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> court where the case is being heard. He had said last month that he was a leftist guerrilla and was a lookout in the killing. The document, handwritten and signed by <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, asks the judge to set a date for a new declaration that will negate the confession. <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>'s lawyers made a copy of the document avaialble to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Justice Minister <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON> presented Miranda to reporters on Jan. 5 to reinforce the government's contention that leftist insurgents killed <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> last Oct. 26. <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> was president of the independent <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Human rights organizations and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic archbishop, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>, had blamed the slaying on a death squad. The rightist squads, reportedly linked to security forces, have been responsible for thousands of political killings since civil war broke out in 1979. Rightists contend the rights commission headed by <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> was a front organization for the guerrillas. Three members of the commission have been killed in recent years and two disappeared. Death squads claimed responsibility for two of the slayings. <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> last month told journalists he served as a lookout for the assassins who shot <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>. He said he was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, one of five guerrilla groups in the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The government contends the rebels killed <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> to create a martyr for their movement. <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, who is the capital's <LOCATION> Mariona </LOCATION> jail, said in his writ: `` I took responsibility in that death -LRB- of <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> -RRB- because I felt very bad and worn out because of the treatment I was given by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. `` I felt worn out since a doctor arrived and, while I was blindfolded, gave me an injection ... this and other acts against me and my family pressured me to take responsibility for things I did not do.'' There was no indication as to when <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>'s new declaration would be taken by the presiding judge.

 A computer whiz who authorities say went on a shooting rampage at his former company when his fantasies of romance with a co-worker unraveled was charged Thursday with seven counts of murder. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> also was charged with three counts of attempted murder, burglary and vandalism in Tuesday's shotgun massacre at the defense plant in neighboring <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>. The 39-year-old <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> man, a software development engineer fired two years ago from <ORGANIZATION> ESL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was ordered held without bail. He is scheduled to enter a plea March 4. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON> said he would seek the death penalty. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, who was being held under a suicide watch at the county jail, shot his way into the high-security installation and damaged the interior, authorities said. Three people were wounded by gunfire; a fourth broke an arm trying to escape. Among those recovering Thursday was ESL employee <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a 26-year-old electrical engineer, called the main target of the shootings. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> says she refused to date <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> but he haunted her for four years with strange gifts and threatening letters and frequently followed her. She obtained a temporary court order earlier this month for him to keep away from her, and that order was made permanent Wednesday. At ESL's offices Thursday, several employees were led through the facility where the attack occurred. The tours were `` part of the healing process'' and were recommended by counselors, spokeswoman <PERSON> Edie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON> said. Employees saw walls and floors riddled with bullet holes and dozens of computer terminals with screens shot out, she said. Numerous windows also were shattered. Blood stains had been painted over and most rugs removed. The extent of damage made it evident `` we were very lucky not to lose a whole lot more people,'' <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON> said. The company plans to reopen its first floor Friday and its second floor, scene of most of the damage, on Monday. Meanwhile, investigators and colleagues reported that the burly <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> native apparently had no criminal record, had been honorably discharged after 11 years in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, was highly intelligent and performed satisfactorily at several top-secret defense jobs he had held in the <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. He is a part-time student in computer science at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and was engaged to marry another computer student. He was known as `` competent, cheerful, a pretty nice guy,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Edinger </PERSON>, president of Sunnyvale-based <ORGANIZATION> Covalent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, his current employer. But neighbors said <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, who lived in a dilapidated cottage with peeling paint, was a loner who never said hello to anyone. When he failed to get dates with <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, he began living in a fantasy world, said <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> was fired in May 1986 from his $ 36,000-a-year job as a software development engineer after sending a letter threatening <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s life, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> DeRuntz </PERSON>, a company manager. The attack, said police Capt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and Lt. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON>, was <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s way of showing he would n't tolerate being spurned by Black or laughed at by other ESL employees. According to court records <PERSON> Black </PERSON> filed in seeking the court order, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> believed the two had taken vacations together and even tried to pass faked photographs as proof that the dates occurred. Toward the end of the four years of alleged harassment, he issued frequent warnings that `` something bad'' could occur. `` It might not really occur to you how far I'm willing to go to upset you if I decide that's what I'm forced to,'' he wrote in a letter to Black last July. Then on Nov. 13 he wrote: `` This is going to escalate ... All because you think I'm a joke and refuse to listen or to understand that I'm gravely serious.'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said fear of the consequences had caused her to endure the behavior, obtaining an unlisted phone number and moving three times, until she realized last month that `` I'm at the end of my rope.''

 The chief mediator in Nicaraguan peace talks offered a five-point proposal Thursday night in an attempt to break what he called an impasse between the Sandinista government and Contra rebels. The Contras said they accepted the proposal by Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> `` in principle,'' but the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said it needed to be clarified in further talks Friday before they could respond. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, called on the Contras to accept a 30-day cease-fire in exchange for four major concessions by the government. Those concessions were: _ A `` full, general'' amnesty for the several thousand political prisoners remaining in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, including members of former dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>'s National Guard _ A promise to `` reconsider'' a mandatory military draft law that has sparked protests in some cities _ Full freedom of the press, which now is extended only to a handful of communications outlets _ A dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' internal opposition, including 14 dissident political parties and a coalition of business, labor and political groups <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, said <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> did not spell out conditions for the cease-fire `` as to when and where it would take place. We have to clarify those points. `` The requirements of the government were very clear and very well defined,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said. `` But the requirement for the Resistance was not as clear.'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said the cardinal's proposal did not say whether the cease-fire should be country-wide or limited only to certain zones. He said it also lacked any mention of a verification procedure. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> told reporters he offered the proposal after the two sides could not agree on the terms of a cease-fire in the opening session of a second round of face-to-face peace talks. He said the Contras wanted to discuss a cease-fire in `` terms of unifying the Nicaraguan family'' through political reforms, while the government sought to negotiate only a halt in hostilities. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had offered the rebels `` a very, very flexible proposal'' at their first round of direct talks in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, in late January. `` Our attitude is fundamentally open,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> told reporters shortly before the talks resumed Thursday morning. `` We are willing to listen to what they have to say ... on all aspects of a cease-fire.'' <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON>, one of seven Contra negotiators, said his side also approached the talks `` with our minds open. We hope we can make definite progrss in these negotiations.'' The talks took place in church offices next to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, where the presidents of five Central American nations prayed together after signing a peace accord last Aug. 7. It was that pact that brought the two sides in the 6-year-old Nicaraguan conflict together, first in indirect talks in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> late last year, then in face-to-face meetings. The Sandinistas arrived at 3 p.m., passing about 75 Nicaraguan refugees who gathered outside the church offices chanting slogans and carrying anti-Sandinista banners. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> arrived minutes later and met privately for about half an hour with the Sandinista delegation. The Contras came to the meeting at 3:30 p.m. in a rented bus and were greeted as heroes by the protesters. One rebel negotiator, a field commander known as Commandante Tono, held a fist aloft in defiance. He was hugged and kissed by women demonstrators. The Contras and <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON> sat down together and began talks at 4:30 p.m. The discussions are due to continue through Saturday. The first round of direct talks came one week before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for $ 36.2 million in additional Contra aid. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and other Democratic leaders are trying to put together a new package that would provide only non-lethal assistance to see the Contras through a transition to peace. The Contras want the talks to include the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' internal opposition, primarily represented by a coalition of business, labor and political groups known as the Democratic Coordinate. The Coordinate and the Contras have called for 17 changes in the Nicaraguan Constitution, including separation of the army from the Sandinista political party, electoral reforms and the creation of a tribunal to guarantee constitutional rights. The government has countered with a call for a 30-day cease-fire, during which the Contras would be confined to three zones totaling about 4,000 square miles in the northern, central and southern parts of the country. During the cease-fire, the Contras would be able to retain their arms and receive humanitarian aid from relief agencies. At the end of the 30 days, they would be required to either accept amnesty or leave the country.

 A former security consultant to <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $ 50,000 Wednesday for conspiring to obstruct an investigation of alleged fraud by supporters of the political extremist. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankhauser </PERSON> was the first of 14 individual and five corporate defendants in the case, including <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, to stand trial. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, six aides and the five organizations are on trial in federal court here. <PERSON> Frankhauser </PERSON>, 48, of Reading, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, was convicted in December of helping <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and his aides cover up alleged credit card and loan fraud by <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> followers during his 1984 presidential campaign. Testimony indicated <PERSON> Frankhauser </PERSON> advised <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> to order fund-raisers to leave the country, burn documents and refuse to cooperate with investigators. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s attorneys have argued that they thought <PERSON> Frankhauser </PERSON> was working for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and that in following his orders they were acting in the interest of national security. Prosecutors and <PERSON> Frankhauser </PERSON>'s attorney said at his trial that <PERSON> Frankhauser </PERSON> lied about having <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> sources to impress <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frankhauser </PERSON> was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice, which carries a maximium penalty of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> requested a four-year sentence. <PERSON> Frankhauser </PERSON> pleaded for leniency, saying he had to take care of his elderly mother and was planning to get married. He also said that he frequently urged <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> to settle with the alleged fraud victims and that he had cooperated with the government. <PERSON> Frankhauser </PERSON> also alluded to his past membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, the American <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and other extremist groups, telling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON>, `` I've had enough of demonstrations.'' In rejecting the plea for leniency, <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Frankhauser </PERSON> and his attorney had understated <PERSON> Frankhauser </PERSON>'s role in the conspiracy. <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> earlier had told <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> that two grand juries that investigated the alleged fraud were repeatedly stymied because <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> aides followed <PERSON> Frankhauser </PERSON>'s directions on how to obstruct the investigation. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, a candidate for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, is charged with conspiring to obstruct justice. His trial began the week after <PERSON> Frankhauser </PERSON> was convicted and is expected to last several more months. Three other <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> aides named in the 125-count indictment have been granted later trials and three are fugitives.

<TEXT>
 A baby born with most of his brain missing was on life-support systems Wednesday to preserve his organs for transplant, a hospital official said. It was the first such case announced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The baby, whose name was withheld to protect the parents' privacy, was born Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> and transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> At <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>, the baby was put on life-support equipment. `` The infant appears comfortable and is showing signs of brain-stem death,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. The baby suffers from anencephaly, in which most of the brain is missing. Such children almost always die within days. Their organs can be transplanted only if organ damage is prevented by maintaining the infants on life-support. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> is maintaining the infant under medical guidelines developed last year after a woman pregnant with an anencephalic baby waged a nationwide campaign to find a hospital that would consent to keep her child on life-support until the organs could be donated. However, the child was stillborn. The guidelines call for doctors to use machines to keep the baby's organs functioning properly for up to seven days, Ms. <PERSON> Rockewell </PERSON> said. If doctrs declare the infant brain-dead within seven days, he will be listed on national organ donor registries. If the baby is n't brain dead after seven days, life-support systems will be removed and the baby allowed to die. `` We do n't want to prolong the agony of the parents. ... We feel there needs to be a limit set as to how long we'll continue this,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>. No cases of anencephalics being maintained on life-support have been announced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, although Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, chief of <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>'s heart transplant program, hinted last November there have been such infants. One of the hospital's 13 heart transplant patients under age 4 received the heart of an anencephalic baby, but the donor child was in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> triggered an international medical controversy in 1984 when he transplanted the heart of a baboon into an infant known as Baby Fae. She died 20 days later.

<TEXT>
 Watching the frumpy, middle-aged wife of a provincial English vicar spiral out of control may not seem to be the ideal subject for what appears, at first, to be a domestic comedy. But <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON>'s `` Woman in Mind,'' which opened Wednesday at off-Broadway's <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, is a very funny play. It is also a dark, disturbing one, an unsettling look at someone slowly going mad. What makes `` Woman in Mind'' special is its fractured, odd-angled look at the play's main character, a dispirited, dowdy housewife named <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>. The woman is defeated by life and trapped in a marriage where she is not so much unloved as ignored. The play could have been a dismal household harangue, but <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> makes it decidedly unconventional. He carries theatergoers into <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>'s psyche, and it's a harrowing journey. A blow to the head from a garden rake sets <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> off on an escape into fantasy. What <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> does is juggle reality and illusion in front of us, while posing questions about happiness, love and faith and what happens to a woman who has very little of each in her life. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>'s fantasies come alive in the form of a make-believe family, a husband, brother and daughter who look and sound like they just stepped out of a <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON> comedy. Drinking champagne and perpetually dressed for tennis, the trio offers her relief from her unrelenting and uncaring world. These people are the antitheses of <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>'s real-life husband and assorted relatives and friends. The stuffy, smug husband is more concerned about finishing a 600-year history of the local parish than with his wife's mental collapse. The woman must also endure a comic gorgon of a sister-in-law whose ineptness as a cook sends guests fleeing in terror; a well-meaning but accident-prone doctor who develops a crush on her, and an unforgiving son who returns home from the clutches of a bizarre sect where silence was not only golden but absolute. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> sorts out life in her garden, a wonderfully verdant and deceptively tranquil oasis designed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON>. She survives by withdrawing from her tormenters and just refuses to fight when her imaginary and real families battle over her soul. Much of this is accomplished with high humor. The playwright pricks the social, moral and cultural conventions of a lower middle class where appearances count most. It's the one thing Ayckbourne's heroine ca n't keep up with Under <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Meadow </PERSON>'s sensitive direction, <PERSON> Stockard </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON> gives a compelling, unsentimental performance as <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON>'s haunted heroine. It's a wide-ranging portrait, capturing the character's acerbic humor as well as her ever-increasing despair The actress, almost unrecognizable, is a lumpy vision of growing dementia. She wears an unattractive, flower-print dress, and her hair gives new meaning to the term `` dishwater blond.'' Her two families are not of equal interest, and the disparity shows in the performances. <PERSON> Remak </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> is superbly self-absorbed as the vicar, and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Conolly </PERSON> turns in a masterful job as the lethal cook and relentess sister-in-law. There is also a gentle, low-key and thoroughly ingratiating performance from <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> as the well-meaning doctor. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>'s fantasy family is not as well defined, and such fine actors as <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerroll </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Countryman </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>'s idealized husband and brother _ must struggle to make them seem more than just comic devices. To his credit, <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> does n't make <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> completely sympathetic, but gives her several abusive tirades which demonstrate why her husband and son have turned away. The playwright also keeps the audience off-center and at arms length. As <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> descends further and further into insanity, <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> darkens the comedy. The audience still laughs, but it's a nervous laughter born out of the bleakness of the situation. `` Woman in Mind'' never forgets the humor in the horror _ a remarkable balancing act well worth seeing.

 A judge Wednesday ordered the last tenant of the rundown <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON> out of her home of 11 years so that the site of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s assassination can be turned into a civil rights museum.

Local citizens organized in 1982 to buy the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> at a foreclosure auction, and the state later took title to the property. The motel was closed Jan. 11 and its few remaining residents were told to move out. <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a former motel employee, ignored a state deadline Feb. 8 to move out and likened her protest to civil rights battles led by King. She has said the museum would force poor people out of the neighborhood.

<HEAD>Would Tax Amnesty Be The Answer?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twenty states in recent years have conducted tax amnesty programs, most of them with enormous success. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>, about 151,000 people sought to pay up without penalty in 1985-86, bringing $ 392 million to the treasury that otherwise might not have been collected. Illinois raised $ 159.1 million, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> $ 146.8 million, and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> $ 101.7 million. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> collected $ 86.3 million, about four times what it had projected. Viewed as an investment, the states did spectacularly. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> spent $ 2.8 million to bring in 140 times that amount. Illinois' cost was $ 2 million, and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s $ 5.8 million Impressive as they might be, those figures tell only a fraction of the benefits that accrued to states. The states discovered continuing sources of higher revenue because they were able to identify those who had heretofore eluded identification. And honest taxpayers were reassured that they were n't carrying an unfair burden. Moreover, the amnesty programs generally were followed by more disciplined administrative procedures to assure that evasion would n't be so attractive in the future. And that brings up the question: With the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> having spent two decades wrestling with budget deficits, should an amnesty program be considered on a national level? The significance of that question descends with a shock on anyone familiar with the 1983 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> estimate that more than $ 100 billion a year of federal revenue is lost because of under-reporting and nonreporting. The question of a federal amnesty is n't new, having been discussed in the media, academic circles and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has expressed concern about underpayment. Honest and dishonest taxpayers have supported the idea. Now there is more grist for the argument with publication of a study of state amnesty programs by a college professor that suggests there are ways to assure a program' success. Working under a fellowship from the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chugh </PERSON>, economist at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION>, found that the most successful programs were followed by tougher penalties immediately thereafter. <PERSON> Chugh </PERSON> found that guilt and gratitude were among the three most important motivations in successful programs. The other factor, cited most often of the three, was fear. `` Amnesty programs in several states were accompanied by warnings that tax enforcement would be much stricter after the amnesty period,'' said <PERSON> Chugh </PERSON>. And in the more successful programs, publicity reinforced those warnings. There are lessons for the country in the experience of the states, one of them being that failure to pay taxes is n't always to save the money. Ignorance of the law was cited. Confusion was mentioned. Divorce. Procrastination, too. While criminality is an obvious factor in the failure to pay taxes, there are many reasons, some apparently involving simple human failings. One of those may be a failure to understand the tax system. That much becomes clear not so much from <PERSON> Chugh </PERSON>'s study as from the differing answers given to the same questions by those interpreting the tax laws, including the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s own personnel Whatever the reasons, the consequences can not be measured in money alone. <PERSON> Chugh </PERSON> comments that tax evasion in its various forms has grown more serious in recent years, leading to significant social and economic consequences. For one thing, he says, `` the honest taxpayer ends up bearing the additional tax burden.'' And, he suggests, the existence of a huge element of nonpayers actually distorts official data on the economy's performance.

<HEAD>Swedish Crystal Makers Cling to Old Tradition</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VAXJO, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoglund </PERSON>, a commercial artist, brought a new style to the old art of making crystal in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> 30 years ago. He did it with a potato. He threw the potato into a pot of molten glass, creating air bubbles. But when glassblower <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hjelm </PERSON> began to shape a piece at the end of his five-foot-long iron pipe, he became enraged. The crystal had bubbles in it and was n't clear as good crystal should be, <PERSON> Hjelm </PERSON> told <PERSON> Hoglund </PERSON>, and stormed out. The story goes that it took a bottle of shnapps to get <PERSON> Hjelm </PERSON> back, and thus was created a style of crystal bowl and vase _ with bubbles frozen into the thick glass _ that has distinguished <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> in the art of glassmaking. The story of the potato and the air bubbles has entered local folklore in <LOCATION> Smaland </LOCATION>, a southern province in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> known as the Crystal Kingdom. Here, glassblowing is a matter of pride, tradition and economic survival. Smaland, which is too hilly, rocky and forested for farming, has lived from glassmaking for 100 years. The industry has suffered some hard times, but the marriage of artistry, craftsmanship and export marketing has helped bring a revival. Glassmaking employs some 2,500 of <LOCATION> Smaland </LOCATION>'s 700,000 people, and earned $ 180 million in export income during the first 10 months of 1987. Tableware from the Orrefors and <PERSON> Kosta </PERSON> <PERSON> Boda </PERSON> companies appear in homes from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> and can sell for as much as $ 80 per glass. One vase made by Orrefors in 1939 fetched $ 93,000 at an auction this past November. Glassblowing is a craft that generally takes 10 years to master. It's a tricky art to breath a bubble of air into molten glass to give the edge just the right thickness, twirl the fiery mass on the end of the pipe, shape it, cool it and cut it. It's an art still passed on from father to son in <LOCATION> Smaland </LOCATION>. But some aspects of the industry are changing as big companies and high-powered managers take over. `` When I first started working here in 1959 this was a family-owned company,'' said <PERSON> Gunnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cyren </PERSON>, one of eight designers for Orrefors. `` All the youth in the village gathered in the blowing hall to keep warm by the ovens. The door was always open. Today there is a fence around the factory.'' Half a million tourists a year come to the village of Orrefors, which has a population of 1,000, to see the glassworks. Smaland once had as many as 60 glass factories with 4,000 workers. Many companies closed during <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s economic crisis of the 1970s, and now only 20 remain. Orrefors, which began as an ironworks in 1726 and turned to glassmaking later, was bought in 1971 by Incentive, one of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s largest holding companies <PERSON> Kosta </PERSON> <PERSON> Boda </PERSON> was acquired by Uppsala-Ekeby, another multi-company group. Anxious to keep employment high, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s Social Democratic government subsidized the industries and pressured the larger companies to buy up the smaller factories to keep them open. `` They were afraid that the villages would die if the plants closed,'' Orrefors' president, <PERSON> Goran </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhoff </PERSON>, said in an interview. A 1982 devaluation of the Swedish krona, together with the big-scale management and marketing of the new owners, turned around the industry. Now the numbers are climbing again. About 40 young artists have opened studios to sell to tourists and other small markets, says <PERSON> Gunnel </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, curator of the Smaland Museum here in <LOCATION> Vaxjo </LOCATION>, the regional capital. The threat to the handblown glass industry today comes from new technologies, said Mrs. <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>. `` If we make good tableware here, others soon copy it with machines and sell it much cheaper. But the unique pieces, the ` art glass,' that's something else,'' she said. Glassmaking is a symbiosis between the artist and the artisan. `` You do n't do any of the craftwork yourself,'' says designer <PERSON> Erika </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagerbielke </PERSON>. `` You make a sketch and try to explain to the glassblower what is to be done. When you work well with someone, one plus one sometimes adds up to three or four. Sometimes you both end up surprised.'' That was the way it was 30 years ago with <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoglund </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hjelm </PERSON> and the hot potato.

 They call themselves `` The Steeple People,'' and their creations can be found reaching for the sky from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has been one of them since his college days when he took a part-time job to help pay for his education. Today, at 48, he is president and co-owner. `` There are n't many things we ca n't do when it comes to steeples,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` We also specialize in cupolas, crosses, towers, or anything else needed to decorate a church or a building.'' <ORGANIZATION> Campbellsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>' products are shipped everywhere and may range from six feet to 229-feet, which is the size of what <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> calls the world's largest prefabricated steeple. `` We're trying to get it included in the Guinness Book of Records,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, adding that the $ 350,000 project was built for the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huntsville </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. Other installations include the Baptist Pavilion at the 1982 World's Fair in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>; the Solidarity Tower replica in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; and reproduction of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, steeple, which was originally constructed during <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Revere </PERSON>'s time `` The order from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> called for a cupola for a waterworks system.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s plant, located 80 miles from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, has 85 employees, including six draftsmen who will furnish a design if the customer does n't know in advance what he wants. The company mails out more than one million pieces of advertising annually, but <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he also gets sales from the interstates. `` Somebody will see our trucks, loaded with steeples or cupolas, and then telephone us to ask, ` How do I get one of those things?''' His crews do a lot of driving. Several years ago, they made four 1,200 mile trips to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, to erect a spire on a Roman Catholic landmark there. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> became involved with steeples after <ORGANIZATION> Campbellsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> set up a small industry complex on campus to help students with their finances. `` I was among those who were able to work with wood or metal, turning out items that could be marketed for a nominal profit.'' Later, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> taught art in high school but returned to the college as a full-time employee handling designs and sales for the complex. In 1969, <ORGANIZATION> Campbellsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> sold the business to a private individual who kept it 10 years before he was bought out by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and three other employees. Although the company is diversified, steeples still account for 60 to 70 percent of sales. They also have caused a few embarrassing moments. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> recalled the time that a contractor in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> purchased a steeple and gave `` our deliveryman vague instructions about reaching the church where it was to be installed.'' The spire went to another church and the contractor showed up the next morning to retrieve it. Before he could say anything, the excited minister told him: `` We have been praying for new pews and an anonymous donor provided them. `` We prayed for new carpet and got it anonymously. `` The last item we wanted was a new steeple. Last night, the Lord put it in our front yard.'' The contractor explained the mixup and admitted later to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> that `` it was the hardest thing I've ever done.''

 Oil prices remain mostly lower amid sluggish demand and adequate supplies. At the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, contracts for March delivery of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, closed Wednesday at $ 16.61 per 41-gallon barrel, down 6 cents from Tuesday. Among refined products, wholesale contracts for unleaded gasoline closed at 46.66 cents a gallon, up 0.37 cent, while wholesale heating oil was down 0.79 cent at 45.58 cents a gallon. A trade report published late Tuesday stimulated an early rally, because the numbers showed sharp drawdowns of gasoline and heating oil supplies, as well as a cutback of refinery use in the week ended Friday, analysts said. They said the figures _ released by the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> _ led many traders to believe that prices would increase, as existing demand chased tigher supplies.

<HEAD>Union: Northwest Flight Attendants Will Strike if No Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' 6,500 flight attendants will vote to strike on Feb. 26 if they have n't reached agreement on a new contract, <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union officials say. About 300 flight attendants with the <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, Minn.-based airline began the strike authorization vote Tuesday during a union meeting in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>. Results of the voting, which will continue through Saturday in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and five other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, are expected to be announced at a strike rally Monday night, <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> Local 2747 officials said Wednesday. Strike authorization requires a two-thirds majority of the membership. In the last strike against <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, the machinists union walked out for 27 days in May 1982. The two sides have not negotiated since the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> released them from mandatory negotiations last month because they were deadlocked over wages, fringe benefits and work rules. A 30-day cooling-off period ends Feb. 26. A federal mediator is expected to bring the two sides together again next week, although no date has been set. Northwest officials said they are determined to keep flying if a strike occurs. About 2,000 Northwest managers are qualified to be flight attendants and would be used during a strike, said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. Northwest also has advertised to recruit replacement flight attendants over the past few weeks. But some travel agents are beginning to warn prospective <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> passengers of a possible strike. `` People are starting to ask about it, `` said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mossier </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> travel agency Northwest, which merged with <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, controls about 60 percent of the Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> passenger traffic In the event of a strike, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 2 carrier in the Twin Cities, would bring in larger planes for Twin Cities flights, according to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonring </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, a federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> ordered the Teamsters local to reinstate <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants Guy Meek and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> as members of the union's negotiating committee. Meek and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> formerly worked for Republic. The Teamsters must allow the two men to participate in negotiations and vote on whether to send any contract offers to the flight attendants for ratification, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> ruled. Teamsters officials had ejected the two men from the bargaining committee last fall, alleging that they tried to persuade 2,800 former Republic attendants not to pay union dues. Former Republic attendants said the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> have urged them to pay union dues voluntarily. It was not clear from the judge's order whether the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> can force the members to pay dues, but <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said all flight attendants would be allowed to vote on the strike authorization whether or not they were current on dues. On another front Tuesday, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and its machinists union will have to arbitrate a 1 -LCB- - year-old dispute over restoration of wage cuts granted by about 1,200 former <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> dismissed a lawsuit brought by <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 143 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> in November 1986 and refused to order Northwest to pay the higher wages. The dispute, which involves mechanics, stock clerks, plane cleaners, custodians and clerical workers who granted wage concessions to Republic, should be resolved by an arbitrator, not a federal judge, <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> ruled.

The <LOCATION> Towson </LOCATION>, Md.-based manufacturer will consider raising that price, `` only on the basis of information that we have n't seen yet.'' However, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing should not be taken as a sign that <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> is willing to raise the price, she stressed. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> has urged its shareholders to reject <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>'s $ 2.1 billion hostile takeover. The New York-based maker of plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment has also adopted a `` poison pill'' defense that allows its shareholders to buy back shares of the surviving company at half their market value. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> also has said it is considering alternatives to the bid, including a restructuring, leveraged buyout or a friendly merger with another company. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, which originally bid $ 56 a share for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> stock, said last week it had obtained bank financing for the deal.

Ms. <PERSON> Bianchi-Sand </PERSON> proposed reforms that she said were inexpensive ways to improve cabin safety. `` All that is needed is a will to make flying truly safe,'' the union president said. `` We have learned from emergency after emergency that changes are needed.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bianchi-Sand </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> should update its standards to require passenger seats that do not break loose in a crash, require life vests on more planes, and limit the hours that flight attendants can work. Ms. <PERSON> Bianchi-Sand </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> also should resist industry pressure to repeal a ruling that would require improved cabin materials and reduce the threat of toxic smoke. `` Where costs are involved, the industry is almost shameless,'' she said.

<HEAD>Campeau Increases Pressure On Federated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has intensified the pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by boosting its tender offer for the giant retailer to $ 61 a share. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, meanwhile, continued to look into ways of avoiding a hostile takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s amended offer came Wednesday a day after the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> board of directors rejected the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> developer's previous proposal to pay $ 66 a share in a definitive merger agreement. The board had questioned whether <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had the necessary financial backing to complete the $ 5.85 billion deal. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said it would further sweeten its bid to $ 66 if <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> agreed to be acquired by midnight Sunday. The company was only willing to pay $ 66 a share if <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> management agreed to go along voluntarily. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> is offering a lower price if Federated management resists. Instead of accepting the tender offer, the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> directors decided on a restructuring that could include retaining <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s department stores and selling its other assets, the company said The latest rebuff by <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s directors did not deter <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, which said Wednesday it has the necessary financing to buy <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s latest tender offer of $ 61 a share amounts to about $ 5.4 billion, a sharp increase from the $ 47 a share, or roughly $ 4.2 billion, it initially offered on Jan. 25. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> rejected the original tender offer as inadequate. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock fell $ 2 to $ 61.75 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Wednesday. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> also twice rejected <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s alternative offer for a definitive merger agreement, including offers of $ 61 and $ 66 per share, because it questioned <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to complete such a deal. However, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joele </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Wednesday that `` financing for a $ 66 bid is absolutely solid.'' <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> managers are looking into other options, such as selling to other unspecified interested parties, issuing perferred stock and buying back more than half of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s 88.5 million shares. Analysts said it was unclear how <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> might proceed if it chooses to sell its non-department store assets. `` A lot depends on whether they sell them to someone outright or spin them off'' through a public stock offering, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Seidler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amdec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> operates about 650 stores in 36 states and had sales exceeding $ 11 billion last year Its holdings include <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, both based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s - <LOCATION> Wilshire </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; and The company could be considering selling chains such as its <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION> grocery stores, Main Street soft-goods stores, Gold Circle discount stores and Children's Place clothing stores, industry observers said. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s directors said a shareholders' rights plan adopted by the board last month would take effect Thursday. The plan, known as a `` poison pill'' defense, is designed to discourage an unwanted takeover by making such a move more expensive. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> spent last weekend negotiating with numerous parties, including <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, which bought <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in December 1986. Among those believed to be interested is the takeover specialist firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s upgraded tender offer Wednesday includes a provision that recently enacted anti-takeover legislation would have to be invalidated. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> is challenging anti-takeover measures in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Cincinnati-based <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> could be covered by both anti-takeover measures because it is based in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>.

In <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters refused to confirm or deny the accuracy of the report. `` On Jan. 8, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> announced as part of its restructuring plan that it would aggressively move foward to get partners in joint ventures based on its downstream operations,'' said <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON>. `` At this stage, it would be inappropriate to issue public statement regarding those discussions.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has been considering taking a large stake in the refining and marketing arms of one of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> major oil companies which were once shareholders in the <ORGANIZATION> Arabian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, or Aramco, oil industry officials said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has made satisfactory moves to regulate its stock and futures markets to curb insider trading, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` I think the Japanese are moving at a good pace toward insider trading restrictions,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, who arrived here this week at the invitation of Japanese officials for talks on improving cooperation to guard against insider trading and cope with market volatility. `` I have had a great sense of a desire for cooperation between the American and the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> stock markets, futures markets and regulators,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities industry, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a joint statement Wednesday saying both sides had agreed to strengthen measures against insider trading and improve communication between exchanges in both countries. The statement came a day after the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> recommended in a report stronger measures against insider trading on par with those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The report said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Securities and Exchange Law should be tightened to specifically prohibit insider trading and recommended that criminal penalties replace current civil penalties for such abuses. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said the proposal `` seemed to cover the elements of insider trading as we know it in the corporate environment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Wednesday's joint statement vowed to encourage discussions between self-regulatory organizations in both countries to detect fraudulent activity and develop `` procedures for the exchange of financial, surveillance and investigatory information among those organizations.'' Restrictions on insider trading, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said, must be approached carefully because of a conflict between preventing inside corporate information from leaking to the public and a desire to encourage public disclosure of certain information. The infrequency of corporate takeovers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> helps prevent large-scale insider trading, he said. Knowledge of a planned takeover before its public disclosure is a key reason for insider trading, as it creates an opportunity to buy stocks of a target company and often sell them at a higher price later. But financial sources have said information is often leaked to investors in the Japanese market. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s big four securities firms _ <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> _ can handle as much as 80 percent of daily stock trading volume, creating an environment for market manipulation, financial sources say. Until October's worldwide stock market crash led the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to impose rules on reporting transactions, Japanese executives were not required to report transfers of their shareholdings. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> recognized a growing `` interlinkage'' between markets in both countries and agreed that planned expansion of futures trading in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will intensify their interdependence, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said. He also said communication between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese markets would be improved after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is put in direct contact with the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> In talks this week, the ministry and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> agreed to create safeguards to counter `` market emergencies,'' their joint statement said. `` Market volatility, as experienced in October 1987, becomes even more a global concern,'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said, and praised the caution exercised by Japanese institutional investors in times of crisis. Stock prices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> fell about 23 percent on Black Monday, but the Nikkei Stock Average, the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market's key indicator, followed with a fall of less than 15 percent partly because Japanese institutional investors were reluctant to flee the market, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said. `` I think I will go back to give the message to institutional investors that they should be more cautious in their reactions, like Japanese investors,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a $ 1.09 trillion conciliatory, election-year budget today that combines his most restrained military request ever with proposals for more spending on education, science and the fight against AIDS. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1989 budget, the last budget of his presidency, calls for reducing the federal deficit from $ 150.2 billion last year and the $ 146.7 billion estimated for 1988 to $ 129.5 billion in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1. That is below the target of $ 136 billion called for in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. The new budget also contends that the `` economy has shown few signs of serious damage'' from last October's stock market plunge, and that the recent boom in exports holds out the promise of continued economic expansion. But signs of economic weakness were evident in the government's reports that housing construction fell in January while industrial production rose at a slower rate than in each of the previous two months, some analysts say The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that housing construction fell 1.9 percent to its slowest pace since the end of the last recession five years ago. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said industrial production rose 0.2 percent in January after 0.4 percent gains in November and December. The report on construction of single-family homes and apartments raised new concerns among some economists about the possibility of a recession this year. The January decline in housing construction followed a 15.5 percent December tumble and pushed building activity down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.38 million units, the slowest pace since a rate of 1.3 million units in December 1982, just as the last recession was ending. Housing is being watched very closely in the aftermath of the stock market crash last October because it is often one of the first sectors to weaken at the onset of a new recession. The weakness last month came from a 2.9 percent decline in construction of single-family homes, which fell to an annual rate of 1.01 million units. This drop offset a 0.8 percent increase in construction of multi-family housing, which edged up to an annual rate of 366,000 units. Building permits, considered a good sign of future activity, fell 8.2 percent in January to an annual rate of 1.25 million units, the lowest level for permits since January 1985. Permits had fallen 7.4 percent in December. In a separate report, a private forecasting firm estimated that construction contracts will drop 4 percent this year, led by steep declines in office and other commercial building and lesser drops in housing and public works projects. Builders will commit to $ 246.2 billion worth of new contracts in all of 1988 compared with $ 255.2 billion last year, according to an update of the 1988 Dodge-Sweet's Construction Outlook from <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Private analysts said the slower growth in industrial production may indicate the economy will slow in the early part of 1988 as businesses work off a backlog of unsold inventories built up during the final three months of 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> traced the output rise in January to production of non-durable goods, which rose 0.4 percent. Production of durable goods, items expected to last three years, showed no increase last month.

<TEXT>
 In a budget that calls for few tax changes, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today recommended a tax break to help parents save to pay for a college education for their children. The president, in submitting his 1989 budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said he will ask lawmakers to make tax-exempt the interest on savings bonds that are redeemed to finance post-secondary education. This would cost the government an estimated $ 10 million during the 12 months beginning next Oct. 1. The tax benefit would be targeted for lower - and middle-income families and would be eliminated as earnings exceed a certain level `` The costs of post-secondary education have increased substantially in recent years, often faster than inflation,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his written message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` As a result, parents may have difficulty bearing these costs unless they establish a savings program for this purpose when their children are young.'' The biggest new revenue-raiser recommended by the president would require all state and local government employees to pay the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> hospital-insurance tax. The tax, which most Americans already pay, is 1.45 percent of the first $ 45,000 earned. The levy is collected as part of the Social Security tax. The tax already is collected from state and local workers hired after March 31, 1986. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said workers hired before that date also should be required to pay in order to reduce a drain on the Medicare system. The change, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has rejected several times, would bring in $ 1.6 billion in 1989. Repeal of the `` windfall-profit'' tax on the oil industry, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also has rejected, is included in the president's budget. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says the tax, which was imposed when oil prices were rising, is an unnecessary paperwork burden on the industry at a time of declining prices. The oil industry would get a $ 52-million tax break under the budget if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> goes along with a proposed modification of rules affecting the depletion allowance. Other revenue proposals: _ A permanent tax break for owners of shares in mutual funds, who would be affected by a 1986 tax change that limits miscellaneous itemized deductions to those that exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted an exception to mutual-fund deductions for 1987 only. _ Permit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to allocate at least two-thirds of their total research and development expenditures to domestic operations This would save them about $ 600 million in 1989. _ Make permanent a temporary tax credit for research and experimentation, saving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies $ 400 million next year _ Repeal a provision imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that reduces air-ticket taxes and aviation-fuel levies when federal spending for airport and airways imporovements drops below a certain level _ Increase user fees incurred in federal regulation of nuclear power plants _ Change the method of calculating a special fee on imported products, costing the government about $ 100 million next year The modification of the 0.17-percent fee is necessary to bring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into compliance with international trade agreements.

 A major Wall Street debt analyzer has lowered its credit ratings for eight of the nation's biggest banking institutions because of a decline in its valuation of their foreign loans. The action Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> comes 15 days after another credit ratings service, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, lowered its estimate of the creditworthiness of five big banking companies. Among the banking concerns downgraded by <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> was <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which lost its top rating. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s affirmed its top rating for <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION>'s banking unit, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> In a statement, the company said it was disappointed that the rating of the holding company `` does not appear to recognize fully our exceptional capital position and our capacity to repay all debt without reliance on any dividends from <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> also said it had confirmed its ratings for three banking companies and was continuing to review its rating on debt from a 12th banking concern, <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The ratings help determine interest rate levels for companies borrowing money in the credit markets and apply to securities of various maturities. A lower rating often means a company may have to pay more interest to sell debt. The downgradings affected about $ 48 billion in outstanding debt, while the confirmations applied to about $ 34.6 billion in debt, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s said. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Arner </PERSON>, senior analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, said the action followed a review begun last December of loans that a dozen major banking companies and their subsidiaries had outstanding to Third World countries. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> had previously indicated that some Third World countries, including <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, were becoming economically less capable and politically less willing to continue servicing their debt as agreed. <PERSON> Arner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> review indicated that some banking institutions continued to carry some Third World loans on their books at a higher value than the ratings concern felt was warranted. `` We think their assets are worth less. We think banks will continue to need to build their capital and that our ratings are reflective of our assesment of their ability to do that,'' he said. The ratings cuts generally ranged from one to three steps on the agency's 10-step system for investment quality ratings, depending on <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s assessment of the varying earnings potential, capital and assets of each of the concerns. The eight downgrades included <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N.A </ORGANIZATION>.; <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The three ratings confirmations were for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nova </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s took different approaches in some cases on its ratings of debt issued by a bank holding company and that by its subsidiary bank. While lowering the rating for <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s confirmed its rating for the parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's biggest bank and <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's biggest bank holding company. On Feb. 2, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's said it was lowering its rating on debt from <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, citing Third World loans. At the same time, it affirmed its ratings for <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Many major banking companies reported losses or sharply diminished earnings in 1987 as they boosted their loan-loss reserves, which provide a cushion for future earnings against loans that may be written off or sold at a loss. But <PERSON> Arner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s viewed some of those actions as `` accounting transfers'' that the agency felt `` have not added any real strength to the balance sheet.''

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration today issued an economic forecast any Republican presidential candidate could run on with pride, predicting a record sixth year of peacetime economic growth with no increase in inflation. The administration, which in the past has been derided for its `` rosy scenarios'' of future economic activity, presented an optimistic view that the current expansion will continue into the indefinite future. And it derided initial recession fears from the October stock market crash as `` greatly exaggerated.'' `` Despite the sharp reversal in stock prices, however, the real economy has shown few signs of serious damage,'' the budget forecast stated. While the economic assumptions that underpin the president's 1989 budget are more optimistic than the predictions made by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and most private forecasters, they are not as far from the general consensus as in previous years Indeed, the administration boasts that its economic forecast a year ago, which was also above the general consensus, turned out to be closer to right. The economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew 3.8 percent in 1987, when measured from the fourth quarter of 1986. The administration had predicted 3.2 percent growth. `` Most forecasters failed to anticipate the magnitude of the improvement in the manufacturing sector just then getting under way,'' the budget stated. For 1988, the administration predicts manufacturing will remain a source of strength with export sales continuing to rise because of the weaker dollar. The administration predicts the overall economy will expand at a 2.4 percent annual rate this year with much of that growth coming from the improving trade deficit. This compares to a CB0 growth forecast of 1.8 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> forecast is the same as the consensus view of 51 top economists surveyed by <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION>, an investment newsletter. Among the economic assumptions, the administration predicts: _ GNP growth will rebound in 1989 to a 3.5 percent rate and stay above 3 percent through 1993 _ Consumer inflation, which rose 4.4 percent last year, will rise by 4.3 percent this year and decline steadily over the next four years to a 2 percent rate in 1993 _ Unemployment, because of the modest growth, will show no improvement this year, remaining at 5.8 percent at the close of the year, matching the current level However, the jobless rate will begin declining modestly in future years, dropping to 5.5 percent in 1989. These assumptions provide the basis for the administration's hopes of making further progress in getting the federal budget under control The 1989 spending plan, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s eighth submission to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has a valedictory quality about it, reviewing in detail the president's economic goals when he took office in 1981 and trying to explain the reasons for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s biggest economic failure, the string of record budget deficits. The administration, as it has in the past, put much of the blame on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for failing to enact its domestic spending cuts. But the budget also says the 1981-82 deficit played a large role, adding $ 112 billion to the deficit in 1983 alone. The new budget calls for reducing the federal deficit to $ 129.5 billion in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, down from an actual budget deficit of $ 150.2 billion in the 1987 fiscal year and an estimated deficit of $ 146.7 billion for the current fiscal year. The 1987 deficit was originally put at $ 148 billion but was revised in today's budget document. The 1989 budget estimate is below the target of $ 136 billion called for in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, but the administration concedes that its estimates in the past have fallen victim to worse-than-expected economic performance. Those pitfalls could derail the current plan as well, the administration says, noting that if GNP growth is just 1 percent lower than the administration is forecasting over the next five years it would add $ 6.3 billion to the 1989 deficit and $ 66 billion to the 1993 deficit. A minority of economists is predicting an even worse outcome for this year, forecasting the economy will fall into an actual recession. If growth is slower than the administration forecasts, or in a worst-case scenario, the country does enter a recession, then that would mean smaller federal tax revenues and higher spending for such programs as unemployment benefits. The current economic recovery began in December 1982, following the worst recession since the Great Depression, and is now in its 63rd month, surpassing the old record for a peacetime recovery of 59 months set between 1975 and 1979.

 The stock market declined slightly today in sluggish trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1.98 to 1,999.01 in the first half hour.

Analysts said there was little in the economic news to prompt traders to take big positions either way. The market rallied last week and Monday as some of investors' worst fears about the business outlook eased But expectations for economic growth and corporate profits remain subdued, and many market participants are evidently reluctant to buy stocks with the Dow hovering around the 2,000 level.

 Early returns in voting today by 32,000 striking empoyees from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s British plants indicated strong approval of a new two-year contract, the company said. `` We are greatly encouraged by the voting figures coming in,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` There have been some big swings in favor of accepting the offer, compared to voting on the last offer, which was turned down.'' The final results were to be released on Friday, but the spokesman said hourly workers from at least eight of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 22 British plants voted to accept the contract. The strike, which began Feb. 8, prompted the layoff of more than 9,700 workers. It disrupted production at a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plant at <ORGANIZATION> Genk </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, and threatened production at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plants in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which rely on parts made at the British plants. The settlement was worked out in negotiations Tuesday between company and union officials. If accepted, operations at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s British plants could resume Monday Shop stewards representing 8,000 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> workers at the traditionally militant Halewood plant near <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on Wednesday recommended rejection of the offer. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a local union official at Halewood, said: `` We feel there should be more money on offer, but we are also concerned that plants on the Continent are getting improvements in hours and holidays and we wo n't be getting that for another two years.'' Shop stewards at a Ford engine-manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Bridgend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, recommended acceptance, saying they believed the company had made significant concessions. That plant employs 1,300 hourly workers. The Financial Times, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s leading business daily, said in today's editions that the strikers seemed set to accept the deal, although possibly by a narrow margin. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the deal appeared likely to gain at least 60 percent support. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> backed down on its demand for a three-year contract, offering instead a two-year pact with wage increases of at least 14 percent over the term of the contract. A <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> assembly worker in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> now earns a basic $ 320 a week. The unions agreed to changes in working practices designed to increase productivity, but the changes must be agreed upon at the plant level instead of being imposed by management. Legislator <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday condemned the proposed settlement `` It is quite clear that other industrial unions will take this climbdown by the management as their bench mark for their claims in the future. This has national implications in relation to the government's fight against inflation,'' he said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s annual inflation rate is now 3.3 percent. This is the lowest it has been since October 1986. The government introduced tough measure to curb the once powerful unions and the last major industrial strike in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was a yearlong walkout by more than 90,000 coal miners in 1984-1985. But the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> strike, a walkout by English Channel ferry crews, and unrest in the state-run <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere prompted fears in some quarters that they could herald a new wave of industrial strife and an explosion in pay demands. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s British workers last walked out for nine weeks in 1978.

 Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Soybean prices fell on profit-taking from Wednesday's sharp gains and in reaction to an increase in farmer selling of soybeans, analysts said. Soybean futures advanced as much as 13 -RCB- cents a bushel Wednesday, partly in reaction to a <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> radio commentary about a `` sudden-death syndrome'' affecting soybean crops. The story turned out to be based on research findings that were first reported nearly two years ago. Speculative buying limited the losses in soybeans this morning, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON>, senior grain and oilseed analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The market's not breaking as much as it could have, so there's some underlying strength,'' <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON> said Corn prices also retreated on increased farmer sales, while wheat prices declined in follow-through selling from Wednesday, analysts said. In early trading, wheat was -RCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 3.26 \ a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 2 \ cents lower with March at $ 2.00 \ a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with March at $ 1.91 a bushel; soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 6.30 Livestock and meat futures were mixed to lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .08 cent higher with February at 71.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .45 cent lower with March at 83.42 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .42 cent lower with February at 46.85 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .28 cent to .48 cent higher with February at 56.00 cents a pound.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Nettleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, citing a downturn in the nation's housing market, says it plans to shut down half its mortgage banking operations and cut about 20 percent of its workforce. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> company, which is the nation's largest independent mortgage banker, said it would take a $ 93 million charge in the current quarter as a result of its restructuring plans. <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> said it expects to lose about $ 69 million for the three fiscal quarters ended March 31 and about $ 55 million for the year. <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wooten </PERSON> said Wednesday that the company planned to close offices in more than 30 of the 65 cities in which its mortgage branch operates, and lay off 500 of its 2,650 employees. The company also cut nearly 1,000 employees last year. Although final decisions have not been made on which offices to eliminate, several are expected to be in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wooten </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s big four commercial banks, said Thursday it suffered a huge loss during 1987, due to the October stock market crash and its decision to raise its loan-loss provision to cover shaky Third World debt. The bank said it lost 456 million pounds, or about $ 798 million, last year, compared with a net profit of about $ 424 million in 1986. <PERSON> Midland </PERSON> took a charge of $ 1.79 billion in the middle of last year for an increase in its loan-loss provisions. But it said an extraordinary gain of $ 110 million, on which it would n't elaborate, helped narrow the 1987 loss. Excluding the loan-loss provision charge, <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> said, its pre-tax profit would have been about $ 894 million. Several major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks also reported a severe drop in 1987 earnings or losses due to their decision to build up provisions for loan losses. The banks' goal was to establish a cushion to protect future earnings from loans that must be writen off or disposed of at a loss. The action was taken after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the developing world's biggest debtor, halted interest payments on its international bank debt a year ago The banks also cited continuing economic woes in Third Wrold countries and a series of debt restructurings. <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> also said `` losses incurred by -LRB- the -RRB- institutional equities business were ... a serious setback, but we believe our investment banking operations as a whole weathered the financial storms of 1987, especially the period since October,'' when worldwide equity markets collapsed. <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> said it began a cost-cutting program at the end of last year.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a $ 1.09 trillion conciliatory, election-year budget combining his most restrained military request ever with proposals for more spending on education, science and the fight against AIDS. `` In presenting this budget, I am keeping my end of the bargain. I call upon <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to uphold its end,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the eighth, and for practical purposes, final budget of his presidency. Unlike earlier <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budgets, the new document embodies an agreement on spending priorities already reached with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1989 budget calls for reducing the federal deficit from $ 150.2 billion last year and the $ 146.7 billion estimated for 1988 to $ 129.5 billion in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1. That's even below the target of $ 136 billion called for in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981 with a promise to balance the budget within three years the annual deficit stood at $ 78 billion. At a White House photo session with congressional leaders, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> extolled the budget for not increasing taxes while increasing spending to battle illicit drugs and AIDS. With a pile of blue budget documents stacked before him on the table, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he hoped the White House and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` can work together through this budget process this year, sticking to our agreement and completing the appropriation process before the end of this fiscal year.'' Leaving a White House meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the Democrats who head the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees said the budget was better than past <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> efforts. Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., said, `` I think it's a good faith budget It looks like it meets the -LRB- budget -RRB- summit agreements. It's right at the targets.'' But <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would not agree to sell off so many government assets as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants. The House budget chairman, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., said, `` There are some better domestic priorities than in the past However, there still are some problems areas, such as the willingness to build more houses in space as opposed to housing here on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.'' In today's budget message, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> conceded the new document `` does not fully reflect my priorities, nor, presumably, those of any particular member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' But, citing `` give and take on all sides,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>: `` The goal of deficit reduction through spending reduction must be paramount.'' The two-year budget pact struck with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last November, in the wake of the stock market collapse, sets limits for both military increases and social program cuts and restricts new taxes to the $ 14 billion already passed for 1989 by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Because of this prior agreement, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fiscal 1989 budget was expected to generate few fireworks on arrival at <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. And budget leaders played down prospects of a major election-year budget fracas. The new <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget contends that the `` economy has shown few signs of serious damage'' from last October's stock market plunge, and that the recent boom in exports holds out the promise of continued economic expansion. In fact, the new <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget assumes a declining rate of inflation, falling interest rates and economic growth of 2.4 percent this year and 3.5 percent next year. This projection is more optimistic than forecasts by congressional budget analysts and private forecasters but closer to their predictions than in previous years. However, if growth is even one percentage point less than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s forecast, the deficit would rise an additional $ 6.3 billion in 1989 and $ 18 billion in 1990, the budget report conceded. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s new budget proposed military spending authority of $ 299.5 billion in fiscal 1989 and actual outlays for the year of $ 294 billion _ up from $ 291.4 billion in 1988 in budget authority and $ 285.4 billion in outlays. That increase, which does n't even keep pace with last year's 4.4 percent increase in inflation, represents the smallest military spending increase ever sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. It is likely to result in reductions in some of the military forces and weapons programs that have grown substantially since he became president. `` Anything less would jeopardize not only our security ... but would also dim the prospects for further negotiated agreements with our adversaries,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget recycles a number of favorite administration proposals for reducing government programs. These include the abolition of the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> direct loans, urban development action grants and public subsidies for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> rail passenger service and mass transit systems. In addition, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> again proposed the sale naval petroleum reserves and some regional power-marketing authorities _ including the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Even though these `` privatization'' efforts have never gained much support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expanded the concept this year by proposing, for the first time, the sale of waste treatment plants, mass transit projects and the <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, he asked for studies of `` possible privatization'' of some <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> operations and the government's uranium enrichment facilities. However, this year, the administration backed away from some of the more politically controversial proposals of past <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budgets _ including abolition of the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and sale of the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION>. At the same time, the president laced his 1989 request with a number of items certain to be politically palatable _ including nearly $ 2 billion in spending authority to combat `` the scourge of AIDS,'' a 38 percent increase over 1988 levels. In addition, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ who last year caused congressional consternation by proposing sharp cuts in education spending _ proposed a $ 1.5 billion increase in education outlays, a rise of 8 percent, well over inflation. The new budget also earmarked $ 1.6 billion in spending authority to upgrade the nation's air control system and a $ 430 million increase for the `` Superfund'' program to clean up hazardous waste sites. Other new proposals for spending authority in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1989 budget: _ A request for $ 437 million, more than double last year's budget, for federal prison constructon to relieve overcrowding _ A 13 percent increase, to $ 3.9 billion, for drug law enforcement and treatment programs. _ A request for $ 11.5 billion for space programs, including the program to orbit a manned space station and to improve the `` performance and reliability'' of the space shuttle. _ Spending of $ 363 million to begin construction of the Superconducting Super Collider, `` the largest pure science project ever undertaken.'' _ Stepped up law enforcement efforts, with a focus on white collar crime, organized crime and terrorism. _ Full funding for a $ 2.5 billion, five-year program to combat acid rain. Although the budget proposal would come in under the $ 136 billion deficit ceiling specified by the Gramm-Rudman law, part of the savings would be accomplished with the sale of federal assets _ including about $ 12 billion in federal loans. Under the budget agreement, asset sales can not be fully counted toward meeting the deficit reduction target. Taking out these sales, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget would result in a deficit of about $ 143 billion. That would still be within the bounds allowed by the law, which says the 1989 deficit can be as high as $ 146 billion without triggering automatic spending cuts.

 Prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fell Thursday after a weak early trend on Wall Street compounded earlier worries about inflationary pressure on the British economy. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed down 12 points, or 0.69 percent, at 1736.1. The market was depressed during the morning by the release of economic data that pointed to increased inflationary pressure on the economy. The figures revived worries of a further increase in base lending rates. The market was especially concerned by an increase in bank lending last month. Share prices fell to the day's low during the afternoon because of a weak early trend on Wall Street, dealers said.

Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> B.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its fourth-quarter profit jumped 58 percent from a year earlier, partly because of higher sales in its key polyvinyl chloride plastic business. <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> said it earned $ 20.5 million, or 73 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31 compared with $ 13 million, or 51 cents a share, earned during the same period of 1986. Fourth-quarter sales were $ 567.3 million, compared with $ 491.3 million during the same period in 1986. Sales of polyvinyl chloride and intermediates rose 26.4 percent to $ 273.4 million during the quarter, the company said in a news release. <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> also reported a 25 percent boost in sales of specialty chemicals, to $ 181.4 million. Sales of industrial products were down 36.4 percent, while sales of aerospace and defense products dropped 4.7 percent, <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> said. Rising polyvinyl chloride sales also were credited with more than tripling <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON>'s annual profit, although total company sales declined. Net income for 1987 was $ 105 million, or $ 4.06 a share, compared with $ 32.7 million, or $ 1.32 a share, in 1986. Annual revenue fell to $ 2.2 billion from $ 2.5 billion in 1986.

<HEAD>Post Office Hops Cuts Will Save $160 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mail cutbacks, forced by federal budget reductions, are starting to be felt by customers who are finding some windows closed at post offices and their out-of-town mail being delayed. Post offices dropped their third shift on Sundays starting last weekend, said <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. The group works from about 3 p.m. to midnight and sorts mail bound to other cities. The move is expected to save between $ 55 million and $ 60 million toward covering the $ 160 million the agency has to absorb in cuts in the current fiscal year, she said. In addition, $ 50 million is expected to be saved by closing post office window services for a half-day a week, with the balance to come from cuts in transportation, management travel, training and other expenditures. Dropping the third-shift of mail processing on Sundays is expected to primarily affect mail going out of town, said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. She said Sundays were chosen for the cut because that is the day when the least mail is deposited in the system. The first and second shifts, which generally sort mail for delivery within the city where the office is located, are remaining at work on Sundays, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> closed most of its post offices on the Saturdays following Christmas and New Year to cut costs, and now has instituted a local program of closing a half-day a week. The decision on when to close is being left to local managers. In general, postal managers have said they do not expect the cutbacks to have a major effect on mail delivery, although elimination of some sorting on Sunday could slow outgoing mail. Over the next 21 months the postal service will have to trim $ 430 million from its operating budget and also has had to either postpone or scrap $ 1.7 billion in capital construction and purchasing because of the budget cuts imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. There has been disagreement over how postal workers will be affected. Postal officials have said they do not expect any layoffs, while union leaders contend that the cutbacks could result in loss of several thousand jobs nationwide.

 The stock market hovered in a narrow range today, continuing the sluggish pattern of Wednesday's session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up .83 to 2,001.82 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 683 up, 706 down and 511 unchanged. Analysts said there was little in the economic news to prompt traders to take big positions either way. The market rallied last week and Monday as some of investors' worst fears about the business outlook eased But expectations for economic growth and corporate profits remain subdued, and many market participants are evidently reluctant to buy stocks with the Dow hovering around the 2,000 level.

<HEAD>Supercomputer May Reduce Guesswork in Economic Forecasting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> area will soon be at the center of an attempt to use one of the world's fastest supercomputers to dramatically reduce guesswork in economic forecasting. If successful, the three-year project using a <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> supercomputer could make businesses, consumers and workers less vulnerable to blunders caused by faulty assumptions about the nation's economy. In recent years, supercomputers have produced revolutionary solutions to complex problems in engineering, chemistry, physics, biology, meteorology and other disciplines. Computers have been less successful in economic forecasting, and some economists argue that the problems are so complex that they can not simply through faster `` number crunching.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolnick </PERSON>, director of research at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` In the long run, the supercomputer research should mean a smoother-running economy with fewer government mistakes. That's the objective. That's the hope.'' The supercomputer project, to be conducted at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Empirical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macroeconomics </ORGANIZATION>, will make <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> a magnet for top economic thinkers from around the world. The institute already has applications from as far away as <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> from scholars seeking one of several resident fellowships to work with supercomputers, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkle </PERSON>, the institute's associate director. Ten to 15 economic researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> will take part in the supercomputer research, a study that will begin sometime this year. `` This is path-breaking work,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Newlon </PERSON>, economics program director at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which is reviewing an application to finance a large share of the supercomputer research. The balance of the tab would be picked up by the <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. The Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> is donating free access to a supercomputer. <PERSON> Newlon </PERSON> said the project promises to bring together public and private economic forecasters, who make their living predicting the future, with researchers who are on the frontier of using supercomputers to expand economic thinking. `` What could emerge from this is a new generation of policy, analytical and forecasting tools that will dramatically improve our ability to understand and forecast the way the economy performs,'' he said. In computerized economic forecasting, a computer sifts through millions of pieces of information about the behavior of thousands of businesses and millions of consumers. In this process, the computer tries to simulate changes in the economy in the face of changing circumstances. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, director of the macroeconomics institute, said the mammoth memory and rapid pace of a supercomputer will vastly increase the number of pieces of information that a computer simulation of the economy could store and manipulate. If all goes well, <PERSON> Cray </PERSON> and other supercomputer makers could find a whole new market among economists and other social scientists.

<HEAD>SEC Enforcement Chief Quoted As Saying Heavy Penalties ImpedingNew
Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Severe insider-trading penalties are damaging new cases by discouraging potential defendants from cooperating, a top official of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was quoted as saying Thursday. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> enforcement director and one of the architects behind an aggressive campaign against Wall Street corruption, was quoted as saying in an interview that the prospect of imprisonment, civil fines and financial ruin is convincing some people `` it's better to hunker down than cooperate. It was unclear from <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>'s remarks whether he was suggesting less stringent sanctions against insider trading, the illicit use of nonpublic information to profit in securities transactions. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> spoke to `` The Wall Street Journal Report,'' a weekly television program of business and financial news produced by <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. The company released a partial transcript of his remarks, to be broadcast this Sunday, one year since the Feb. 20, 1987 sentencing of <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a former investment banker whose arrest for massive insider trading infractions spawned a widespread federal investigation. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, who cooperated with the government, was forced to relinquish $ 11.6 million in illicit profits. He received a criminal punishment of two years imprisonment and a $ 362,000 fine. `` We're getting less cooperation today,'' <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> was quoted as saying in response to a question about what has changed in the past year that has made the investigation easier or more difficult. `` More people are asserting their fifth amendment rights and not cooperating,'' he was quoted as saying. `` So we're not able to ask basic questions about contact, and that's certainly their constitutional right, but it does make it more difficult to put together information for an investigation.'' Asked for further explanation, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> was quoted as saying: `` It was one thing when people had to be concerned about a civil action by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and perhaps the disgorgement of money. `` It's another thing, when you talk about putting them out of business completely and, not getting disgorgement of profits, but a civil penalty as well and then subjecting them to the possibility of time in federal prison. So, add it all up and some lawyers are advising their clients: It's better to hunker down than cooperate.'' <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> was traveling abroad until Monday and unavailable to comment about the interview, his office said. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCue </PERSON>, who did n't attend the interview, said `` I've heard <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> say before that there is more hunkering down, so I would not dispute that, but I do n't know if I would make that the greatest news release that ever hit the pike.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s cooperation led investigators to <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, once one of Wall Street's most powerful stock speculators. He paid a record $ 100 million to settle civil charges of insider trading in November 1986 and was sentenced to a three-year criminal term last December. Although <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> are said to have implicated a number of other Wall Street professionals in illegal activity, there have been no significant arrests in the past year.

<HEAD>U.S. Pressure For Trade Concessions Changing Taiwan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Taiwanese trade concessions made under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure are profoundly changing this prosperous island, enraging businessmen who face stiffer competition and delighting consumers who find lower price tags on foreign goods. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which ran up a record trade deficit last year, has pressured <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to cut its hefty tariffs and revalue its currency. Roughly one-tenth of the $ 171.2 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit came from trade with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s most important political ally and receives nearly half of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s exports, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s wishes can not be ignored `` We want to maintain our export market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> so we must take more positive measures to help solve the trade problems -LRB- between the two countries -RRB-,'' Economic Affairs Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ta-hai </PERSON> told a recent legislative session. After decades of closely linking the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollar to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> authorities have allowed their currency to rise about 40 percent against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar since January 1986. The changing exchange rate makes <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> goods more expensive overseas and American products cheaper in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> also recently reduced tariffs on 3,500 agricultural and industrial products in a sweeping move that cut the average duty on imported goods to an estimated 3.8 percent from 7.5 percent, although tariffs on some goods remain much higher. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, however, have indicated they want even further trade concessions from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s other newly industrialized countries _ <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. That upsets Taiwanese who believe the trade concessions already have hurt the country, whose exports account for 58 percent of gross national product. In a poll conducted by the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and published at the end of 1987, about 350 people out of nearly 1,000 interviewed chose the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the most unfriendly nation to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. That was more than double the number of people who picked <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s arch rival. `` Our 40 years of endeavors may be wiped out in these one or two years,'' grumbled <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> K-Moebel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a sporting goods manufacturer whose 140-member work force was cut in half to reduce costs as the rising <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollar squeezed profits. <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' decision in January to remove duty-free and preferential tariffs on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> products would make business even more difficult. `` I am worried that mainland Chinese products, which will continue to enjoy the preferential tariffs, may gradually take over,'' he said. Businessmen argue that the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> government has made too many trade concessions too quickly under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure, giving labor-intensive local industries little time to adjust. Farmers also say the government has sacrificed their interests to please the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by cutting tariffs on farm products. Thousands of farmers descended on <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> last December to protest sharply lowered fruit prices. But <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s policy changes have not all been painful. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> citizens generally welcome the government's tariff cuts on a wide variety of foreign products, which have long been too expensive for most people to afford. An estimated 8,000 American passenger cars were sold to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> last year, an eightfold increase from the year before but still representing only 4 percent of the domestic market. Total imported cars sales increased an estimated 35 percent. Imports of some <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> home appliances and many other goods more than doubled last year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods accounted for an estimated 5 percent of color televisions sold, 14 percent of refrigerators, 21 percent of washing machines and 8 percent of cigarettes. `` American cars are no longer considered as expensive, bulky and gasoline-consuming. Many people are buying them now as the second family car,'' said auto dealer <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>. Office managers, secretaries and salesmen armed with fatter paychecks are buying Buicks, <ORGANIZATION> Skyhawks </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cieras </ORGANIZATION> that once were only within the reach of the most wealthy. A Skyhawk sells for about 700,000 <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollars, or $ 25,000, about 30 percent cheaper than two years ago. `` Many people are finding for the first time they can afford American products,'' said <PERSON> Dustine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, a dealer of <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> home appliances, which used to be more than twice as expensive as local products. `` I did not hesitate at all in buying it,'' <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Pei-pei </PERSON> said of her new <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> washer.'' I know it is more endurable, has a larger capacity and not much more expensive'' than her old Taiwan-made machine. Recent statistics indicate the trade gap is narrowing. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s January trade surplus of $ 843 million with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the lowest since February 1986. With its January exports of $ 1.2 billion, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> replaced <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for the first time since 1963 as the country selling the most goods to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. But the trade battle between the two countries is not yet finished. Local newspapers, with dispatches from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials indicated they would ask <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to further appreciate its currency after the one-month state mourning period for President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, who died Jan. 13 of heart failure. The local media also have reported that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural officials have protested against planned measures by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> authorities to protect local farmers against foreign competition.

<HEAD>Airlines Announce Fare Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has sparked a new round of air fare increases by boosting some one-way coach fares by $ 5 and first-class tickets by $ 10, effective Saturday, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> airlines are among those who matched the increases that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> said Wednesday would affect most tickets except advance-purchase fares, the cheapest available for air travel. `` We felt that a slight, upward fare adjustment was economically justified at this time,'' American spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said at the company's headquarters here. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which in the past year has served as the industry's price leader, matched the fare hikes in a few markets, said company spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Birdsall </PERSON>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> will continue studying the markets where it has not yet raised fares. The higher prices will affect mostly business travelers and people traveling because of a personal emergency or some other spur-of-the-moment reason, officials said. The price increases will affect: _ Many coach and first-class fares for non-stop flights between major cities, including <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> _ Most unrestricted _ and unadvertised _ one-way discount fares _ Some round-trip discount fares with advance-purchase requirements of up to 14 days and cancellation penalties of up to 50 percent American's higher fares will mean, for example, that an unrestricted coach ticket to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> will cost $ 410 one way instead of $ 405. A discounted, unrestricted coach ticket will cost $ 214 on those routes, up from $ 209.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday reported an increase in its fourth quarter profit despite a slight drop in sales, while another major retailer, <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said it had stronger second quarter earnings <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said net income for the three months ended Jan. 30 rose 10 percent, to $ 280 million, or $ 1.93 a share, from $ 253 million, or $ 1.80, during the same period a year ago. Sales totaled $ 4.94 billion, down from $ 4.98 billion. For its fiscal year, the giant retailer's net income totaled $ 608 million, or $ 4.11 a share, on sales of $ 15.33 billion. That compared with earnings of $ 478 million, or $ 3.53, and sales of $ 14.74 billion. Los Angeles-based <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> netted $ 20.4 million, or 94 cents per share, on sales of $ 866 million for the three months ended Jan. 30. A year ago, it lost $ 24.2 million on sales of $ 995.1 million, reflecting a major restructuring. The company earned $ 31.1 million, or $ 1.33 per share, during the first half of its fiscal year, vs. a deficit of $ 7.8 million in the previous year. Sales fell to $ 1.48 billion from $ 1.7 billion. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said the company's retail operations achieved record results during 1987 despite fierce competition during the lucrative Christmas holiday season. The company's catalog operations also were especially strong throughout the year, he said. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> was able to cut many expenses during the fiscal year, particularly in personnel and advertising. As a result of the 1986 tax law, income taxes were cut by $ 17 million in the fourth quarter, he said. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said the company was `` well positioned to respond to consumer buying patterns'' in 1988. `` The expansion of women's apparel offerings and the continued strengthening of men's and children's apparel will result in significant opportunities for stores and catalog,'' he said in a statement. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>'s results for last year included a loss of $ 29.3 million in both the quarter and half for early retirement of debt, although this year's results reflected sharly higher interest payments because of debt linked to its restructuring. As part of the restructuring, the company spun off its higher-end specialty-store operations. It also sold its <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanamaker </PERSON> chain and two <LOCATION> Broadway-Southwest </LOCATION> stores in August 1987. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>'s stores include Broadway, <PERSON> Emporium </PERSON> <PERSON> Capwell </PERSON>, Thalheimers and <PERSON> Weinstock </PERSON>'s department stores.

 <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> police are investigating allegations that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> tampered with the jury in a cigarette liability case that ended in a mistrial last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday.

The allegations were made in affidavits gathered by attorneys for the family of <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, who died at age 50 of lung cancer after smoking American's Pall Mall cigarettes for more than 30 years. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>'s family filed a $ 16.5 million suit in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, against the cigarette maker. The suit ended in a hung jury Jan. 29. In the affidavits, two jurors said they were called during the trial by employees of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION>'s legal team and and told of a change in scheduling. Other affidavits said an American Tobacco adviser boasted of receiving $ 2,700 for his work and was seen talking to a third juror. The company's lead lawyer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON>, termed the affidavits `` absurb'' and `` an absolutely pathetic effort to get some type of publicity.''

 Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower Thursday in a modest sell-off on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Soybeans led the decline in reaction to reduced demand for soybean meal, analysts said. Many traders also took profits after Wednesday's sharp advance in soybean futures, analysts said. Increased farmer selling of soybeans also pressured futures prices, but the losses were limited by news of new soybean oil sales to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and expectations for more export business, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Based on the profit-taking which could have ensued, you're still looking at good underlying strength'' in the soybean market, <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON> said Corn prices followed soybeans lower, while wheat prices retreated on expectations of adequate near-term supplies, he said.

 The stock market showed no clear trend today, continuing the sluggish pattern of Wednesday's session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.15 to 1,997.84 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.

Analysts said there was little in the economic news to prompt traders to take big positions either way. The market rallied last week and Monday as some of investors' worst fears about the business outlook eased But expectations for economic growth and corporate profits remain subdued, and many market participants are evidently reluctant to buy stocks with the Dow hovering around the 2,000 level.

<HEAD>British Petroleum Reports Higher 4th Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 British <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said its fourth-quarter earnings rose by 95 percent, under the accounting standard used by most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil companies, with profits bolstered by stronger gains in refined products, chemicals and minerals The world oil giant, which acquired full ownership of Cleveland-based <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> last year, said it earned 394 million pounds, or $ 683 million, compared with 202 million pounds, or $ 281 million, in the fourth quarter of 1986. Earnings per share totaled 81.6 pence, compared with 44 pence a year earlier. Earnings per American Depositary Receipt, each of which equals four shares, were $ 1.42, vs. 61 cents in the fourth quarter of 1986. Sales totaled 6.8 billion pounds, or $ 12 billion, in the October-through-December period vs. 6.6 billion pounds, or $ 9.4 billion, in the 1986 fourth quarter, the London-based company said. For the full year, the company said it earned 1.3 billion pounds, or $ 2.1 billion, compared with 1.8 billion pounds, or $ 2.6 billion. Earnings per share totaled 208.8 pence, compared with 388.4 pence in 1986. Earnings per American Depositary Receipt totaled $ 4.61 last year, compared with $ 5.72 in 1986, when the dollar was stronger. Revenue for all of 1987 totaled 27.6 billion pounds, or $ 45.2 billion, up from 27.2 billion pounds, or $ 39.9 billion, in 1986. The figures are based on the `` replacement cost'' system of accounting, which is most directly comparable to the Last-In-First-Out system used by virtually all major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil companies. Under this method, the value of inventories is listed according to their market value at the time they are used and must be replaced. By tradition, however, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> also uses the `` historical cost'' method of accounting, under which inventories are valued at their original cost on a First-In-First-Out basis. In its report issued Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> said that under the historical cost method, its profit rose 10.2 percent, to 260 million pounds, or $ 471 million, in the fourth quarter, from 236 million pounds, or $ 341 million in the last quarter of 1986. The results included a loss of 134 million pounds, or $ 212 million, on the value of inventories over that period. For the year, the company said it earned 1.4 billion pounds, or $ 2.3 billion, under the historical cost method, compared with 817 million pounds, or $ 1.2 billion in 1986. Earnings per share totaled 298.8 pence in 1987, vs. 178.4 pence in 1986. Earnings per ADR totaled $ 4.61, compared with $ 5.72. `` Despite a substantial fall in the dollar against sterling and softening of oil prices in the last quarter, our results for 1987 represent a robust performance in a difficult year,'' said <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> researchers have made the world's fastest dynamic memory computer chips, the company said Wednesday at a research conference in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The experimental chips can retrieve a bit of information in 20 billionths of a second, three times as fast as the current generation of so-called D-RAM chips. D-RAM chips are the most common kind of memory chips in computers. They are more compact and cheaper but also slower than static random access memory chips, known as S-RAMs. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said it had built an experimental S-RAM chip that can retrieve information in a record 11 billionths of a second. It announced another experimental S-RAM capable of storing 1 million bits of information, unprecedented for that kind of chip. The announcements were made at the annual International Solid-State Circuits Conference, an event that draws top researchers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Meat Industry Group Concerned Over South Korea Imports Ban</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A meat industry group has asked the government to investigate whether <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has violated international trade practices through its 3-year-old ban on imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said it filed a complaint Tuesday with the Office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative, contending <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s import ban is `` unjustifiable, unreasonable and burden or restrict <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AMI </ORGANIZATION> said the import ban is actionable under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. <PERSON> Manly </PERSON> <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> AMI </ORGANIZATION>, said that historically the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the major supplier of high-quality beef to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, a market that averaged about $ 5 million a year. <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was in violation of obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and under tariff concessions agreed to in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Round of multilateral trade negotiations.

<HEAD>Venezuela Foresees Trouble in Meeting International Payments This
Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Venezuelan government foresees trouble in making foreign loan payments this year but a top government official denied Wednesday the country will seek new terms for repaying $ 20 billion in refinanced debt. `` We will make every effort this year to prevent a significant drop in international reserves, but this will depend on oil prices,'' Finance Minister <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> told a press conference. `` We think we can partially cover the oil price drop,'' <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> said. Petroleos de <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chacin </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> said recently the state oil company will earn around $ 15 per barrel on its oil exports in the first half of the year, or $ 1.70 less than the company's $ 16.70 per barrel estimate for the year. The drop means around $ 1 billion less in oil income, according to private estimates. The oil company originally estimated oil earnings this year of $ 9.6 billion, while other exports could reach $ 1.3 billion. <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> said the government would be paying around $ 3.5 billion this year in interest and principal on its $ 32 billion foreign debt. It will amortize $ 400 million of refinanced debt. `` Renegotiations -LRB- on the refinanced debt -RRB- make no sense while we continue to pay interest,'' <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> said. He said the drop in oil income will be partially covered by $ 300 million more from exports of aluminum and gold. The government will also press for multilateral loans and foreign direct investment, and it is considering additional issues of dollar-denominated bonds, he said. Last week the government launched a $ 100 million Eurobond issue aimed at Venezuelan investors. The government recently reduced the private sector import budget to around $ 7.2 billion but indicated there could be further cuts. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign reserves were $ 9.3 billion at year-end 1987, including $ 3.5 billion of operating reserves. The nation is in technical default of its refinancing agreement if operative reserves fall below $ 2 billion.

<HEAD>EPIC Bailout Expected to Proceed Despite TMIC Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bailout plan in the $ 1.4 billion collapse of real estate syndicator <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is expected to continue despite the financial problems of EPIC's major mortgage insurer, officials said Wednesday. However, the decision last month by <ORGANIZATION> TMIC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to halt claims payments put into default 6,600 of EPIC's properties with unpaid balances of $ 485 million. Deeds to those properties were offered to lenders in lieu of foreclosure, said <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skyline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. That means the lender assumes ownership, rather than the partnerships that had been formed by EPIC to buy the properties Virginia-based Skyline has been hired to oversee the sale of EPIC's properties. The number already had been reduced to 12,500 from 20,000 in the past two years before the <ORGANIZATION> TMIC </ORGANIZATION> default. Cross said the EPIC bailout was expected to proceed despite <ORGANIZATION> TMIC </ORGANIZATION>'s difficulties. Meanwhile, state Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Roxani </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said talks are under way between her agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and private mortgage companies in efforts to rescue <ORGANIZATION> TMIC </ORGANIZATION> and the EPIC bailout plan. A new actuarial study indicating how deep <ORGANIZATION> TMIC </ORGANIZATION>'s troubles are is expected to be completed later this month, Ms. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>, a major purchaser of mortgages from EPIC, was the lead agency in arranging the EPIC bailout plan. <ORGANIZATION> TMIC </ORGANIZATION> is a subsidiary of the nation's leading title insurer, <ORGANIZATION> Ticor </ORGANIZATION>, and has been operating under state conservatorship since April 1986. The bulk of <ORGANIZATION> TMIC </ORGANIZATION>'s problems stemmed from the collapse of EPIC. <ORGANIZATION> TMIC </ORGANIZATION> had insured about 45 percent of the 20,000 mortgages worth $ 1.4 billion syndicated by EPIC as tax shelters for the well-heeled. In 1985, EPIC defaulted on the mortgages and the insurers were left holding the bag. Besides TMIC, two other major mortgage insurers had large liabilities when EPIC collapsed: <ORGANIZATION> MGIC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of Milwaukee-based <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurace </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market gave ground in late trading Thursday as traders apparently shied away from the 2,000 level in the Dow Jones industrial average. Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips dropped 14.58 to 1,986.41 after closing slightly above 2,000 in the week's first two sessions. Declines outnumbered advances by about 7 to 6 among New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 688 up, 813 down and 478 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 151.43 million shares, against 176.83 million in the previous session. Analysts said there was little in the economic news to prompt traders to take big positions either way. The market rallied last week and Monday as some of investors' worst fears about the business outlook eased But expectations for economic growth and corporate profits remain subdued, and many market participants were evidently reluctant to buy stocks with the Dow hovering around the 2,000 level. Speculation has also died down lately that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will take any new steps in the immediate future to relax its credit policy. Not everyone was entirely cool to the market, however. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Clough </PERSON>, chief investment strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, recommended that investors move some money from bonds into stocks, citing evidence of strength in the manufacturing economy, among other things. He suggested that they have 50 percent of their money in stocks, 40 percent in bonds and 10 percent in money market investments, compared with a previous recommendation of 45 percent stocks, 45 percent bonds and 10 percent `` cash.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> was a standout gainer among the blue-chip and technology issues, rising 2 to 59 -LCB-. The company reported earnings for its fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31 of 71 cents a share, up from 45 cents in the comparable period a year earlier. By contrast, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> fell 2 \ to 42 The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $ 1.87 a share, up from $ 1.50 in the last quarter of 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Lomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Nettleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -RRB- to 15 \ on top of a 1 -LRB- - point drop Wednesday, when the company said it would take a charge of about $ 93 million in the current quarter in connection with moves to cease its homebuilding operations and restructure its mortgage banking <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> jumped 4 | to 58 The company said it had n't been approached by anyone with a merger or acquisition proposal. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 10.31 billion, or 0.40 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped .58 to 145.14. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 175.83 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 1.61 to 296.98, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.30 at 257.91.

<TEXT>
 The dollar staged an unusual turnaround Thursday, closing mostly lower in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but rising domestically on technical factors and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement that he wants to rescue a kidnap victim in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Gold prices were mostly lower. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported a late bid for gold of $ 442.80 a troy ounce, down from Wednesday's late bid of $ 446.00. In European trading, the dollar finished lower against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar, with little news to affect trading. Traders sold dollars in anticipation the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency would fall through certain technical levels. But when the dollar failed to cross those points, dealers had to buy back dollars to cover their positions, pushing the currency higher in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> activity, traders said. `` The markets were n't going anywhere, and people needed to buy dollars back,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a vice president and financial market economist at <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Separately, traders said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement that he wants to rescue Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, sparked sudden interest in the dollar. `` The prospects of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> going in with forces to get the colonel out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> adds fuel to the fire because in the case of war breaking out, the dollar is a safe haven,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cally </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 130.00 Japanese yen, down from 130.41. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Thursday, the dollar traded lower at 129.72.

<HEAD>Profit-Taking Pulls The Plug On Livestock Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Livestock futures plummeted the limit allowed for daily trading Thursday in a wave of profit-taking apparently prompted by weak demand for beef and pork products. Futures prices also fell on most other commodity markets. Precious metals, copper, grains and soybeans, energy futures and stock-index futures all retreated. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> index, a measure of the performance of 21 commodities, fell 2.07 points, a fairly large move for the indicator. Livestock and meat traders on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> had been ignoring the weakening cash markets for beef and pork products, but their attitude changed abruptly on Thursday, analysts said. `` We've had a horrible beef market for three weeks and it never bothered anybody. Today it started bothering everybody,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Waldock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We had people start to take profits, and later in the day everybody decided they wanted out,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. Analysts said there had been no change in market fundamentals. `` The profit-taking kind of fed on itself,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Norem </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Agri-Visor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` We had quite a few orders to get out of long -LRB- buy -RRB- positions at the close, and that carried over into the pork complex.'' The selling caused limit-down moves of 1.50 cents a pound in some live cattle, feeder cattle and hog contracts and 2 cents a pound in some contracts for future delivery of frozen pork bellies. Live cattle settled .53 cent to 1.50 cents lower with the February contract, which expires Friday, at 71.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to 1.50 cents lower with March at 82.50 cents a pound; hogs were .48 cent to 1.50 cents lower with February at 46.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .60 cent to 2.00 cents lower with February at 53.70 cents a pound. Gold and silver futures registered substantial declines on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after gold for April delivery passed the psychologically important level of $ 450 a troy ounce only to encounter strong resistance at $ 451.40, analysts said. The subsequent price decline was `` a very typical reaction to a market that breaks out and fails to follow through,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled $ 3.10 to $ 3.50 lower with April at $ 445.80 a troy ounce; silver was 9.5 cents to 10 cents lower with March at $ 6.35 a troy ounce Copper futures fell sharply on the Comex, with the March contract settling 5.75 cents lower at 98.75 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures settled mostly lower in a modest sell-off on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Soybeans led the decline in reaction to reduced demand for soybean meal, analysts said. Many traders also took profits after Wednesday's sharp advance in soybean futures, analysts said. Increased farmer selling of soybeans also pressured futures prices, but the losses were limited by news of new soybean oil sales to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and expectations for more export business, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Based on the profit-taking which could have ensued, you're still looking at good underlying strength'' in the soybean market, <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON> said Corn prices followed soybeans lower, while wheat prices retreated on expectations of adequate near-term supplies, he said. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cent to 6 cents lower with March at $ 3.21 -RCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.00 -RCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $ 1.91 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 6 cents lower with March at $ 6.28 -LCB- a bushel. Unleaded gasoline led energy futures prices lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said crude oil supplies were abundant while demand for gasoline and heating oil was weak. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .13 cent to .19 cent lower with March at $ 16.45 a barrel; heating oil was .50 cent to .73 cent lower with March at 45.08 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .69 cent to 1.30 cents lower with March at 45.97 a gallon. Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.55 points lower at 258.30.

 The nation's basic money supply fell by $ 3.4 billion in mid-February, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure of money known as M1 fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 760.7 billion in the week ended Feb. 8 from $ 764.1 billion the previous week. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $ 754.7 billion, a 1.9 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. Analysts said the latest figure was within the range expected by a number of economists, and as such had little effect on the bond market. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> last year stopped setting a specific growth target range for M1 because of doubts that the measurement accurately reflected underlying economic activity. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> indicated, it was more closely monitoring broader monetary aggregates known as M2 and M3, exchange rates and other economic indicators. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> began reporting M2 and M3 on a weekly instead of monthly basis. M2 fell $ 1.8 billion in the week ended Feb. 8 to a seasonally-adjusted $ 2.94 trillion, and M3 fell $ 2.1 billion to an adjusted $ 3.712 trillion. M2 is made up of M1 and such accounts as savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is the sum of M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday also released its benchmark revisions to the monetary aggregates for 1987. The central bank said M1 growth in 1987 was 6.2 percent, revised from 5.9 percent; M2 growth was 4.0 percent, revised from 4.1 percent, and M3 growth was unrevised at 5.4 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had set a growth target range of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent for M2 and M3. The actual growth was the slowest in those aggregates since the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> began targeting growth in 1979. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks fell $ 368 million in the week ended Feb. 10, compared with a gain of $ 87 million a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said discount window bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> averaged $ 254 million daily in the week ended Wednesday, up from $ 118 million during the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 272.4 billion in the two-week period ended Feb. 10, down from $ 272.9 billion two weeks earlier

<HEAD>Farm Credit System Reports Profit In Quarter, But Loss For Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Farm Credit System said it earned a profit of $ 179 million in the final quarter of 1987, but posted a loss for the full year in spite of a big reduction in its reserve for loan losses. The loss of $ 17 million for all of 1987 was a fraction of the losses of $ 2.7 billion in 1985 and $ 1.9 billion in 1986. The Farm Credit System said its interest income fell because of competition from other lenders and a general decline in the demand for agricultural loans. On the positive side, the system said it was able to reduce the amount of money set aside for possible loan losses because of `` continued improvement in the general agricultural economy and the increased capacity of farmers and ranchers to service their debt.'' Loan-loss reserves were decreased by $ 684 million during the year, to $ 2.95 billion at the end of 1987 from $ 3.64 billion at the end of 1986. The Farm Credit System is a 71-year-old group of 37 banking cooperatives and nearly 400 local lending associations. It was hit hard by weakness in the agricultural economy. Bailout legislation signed into law last year created a private assistance corporation that is authorized to issue up to $ 4 billion in government-backed loans to financially troubled institutions in the system. Interest on the loans will be paid initially by the government, although the Farm Credit System would eventually pay everything back. The Farm Credit System said its profit of $ 179 million in the fourth quarter came on total interest income of $ 1.46 billion. In the year-earlier period, the system had a loss of $ 384 million on total interest income of $ 1.65 billion. In all of 1987, the Farm Credit System's loss of $ 17 million came on total interest income of $ 5.78 billion, in contrast to a year-earlier loss of $ 1.91 billion on total interest income of $ 7.17 billion. The strong fourth-quarter results are not indicative of expectations for 1988, the Farm Credit System said, because they include a chunk of interest income from previous periods that was not previously recorded. The results were also boosted by one-time reductions in loan-loss provisions. The reduction in the provision for loan losses, partly offset by some actual losses, added $ 207 million to the system's bottom line in the fourth quarter and added $ 196 million to the bottom line in all of 1987. In contrast, new provision for loan losses had subtracted $ 356 million from the bottom line in the fourth quarter of 1986 and subtracted $ 1.80 billion from the bottom line in all of 1986. Price Waterhouse, the system's independent accountants, issued an opinion on the statement that was qualified because of questions surrounding the implementation of the federal bailout. `` The successful and timely implementation of the 1987 act is dependent on several factors, many of which are outside the control of the system,'' the Farm Credit System said in a news release.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union is girding for a worldwide strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, but some travel agents say the troubled airline's incentives will keep passengers lining up at the gate. In formally announcing strike plans at a press conference Thursday, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON>, director of the union's airline division, promised a `` traditional type'' of Teamster walkout. Separately, the airline announced it lost $ 265.3 million last year, compared with a $ 462.8 million loss the previous year. The airline, which earlier estimated it lost $ 90 million last year, reiterated in the earnings statement its pledge to remain fully operational in the event of a strike. Genoese said there is enough support for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Local 732 among other <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> locals to cut off the airline's supplies of fuel, laundry and liquor around the world. And he added that there will be violence `` if the company provokes violence.'' The strike is set to begin at 12:01 a.m. EST Sunday, the end of a federally mandated 30-day cooling-off period in the labor dispute. Several travel agents polled Thursday said the public is barely aware of the conflict, which centers on the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' demand for higher pay and the airline's call for belt-tightening. The 4,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> local represents passenger reservation clerks, customer service employees and workers who fuel planes. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s new chairman, told union members in a letter earlier this month that in the event of a strike, the airline `` can and will hire someone to provide the services you withhold.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said the carrier already has recruited potential replacement employees and trained managers within the company to perform some of the Teamsters' clerical functions. The Teamsters have yet to receive a show of support from <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s four other unions. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON>, a spokesman for the 5,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said members voted unanimously Thursday against supporting the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. And a spokesman for the airline's flight engineers said members were advised to `` continue with their work assignments.'' The pilots and flight attendants unions also are not expected to support the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. The pilots, flight attendants and engineers already have accepted labor concessions in an effort to ensure <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s financial recovery <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teison </PERSON>, of Travel Smart for Business in <LOCATION> Dobbs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ferry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said most travelers `` do n't even know about the strike.'' And <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, president of JB's <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he has n't seen any cancellations yet. `` Their frequent-flier program, their special fares that are lower than most other carriers and their triple mileage offer keeps people choosing money over service,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> had no comment on a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> claim that the carrier has begun installing armed guards throughout its facilities at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the airline's main hub. `` Obviously security is a top priority,'' <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said. `` We are making preparations to deal with it, but we wo n't disclose what they may be.'' Genoese said the hiring of the guards was a provocation that by itself could spark violence among members. The Teamsters, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> <PERSON> Buel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, acknowledge that negotiations are still going on. But Genoese said no progress has been made and he remains pessimistic. Picketing is expected to begin Sunday morning, and several rallies have been scheduled at hotels near <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> <LOCATION> airport </LOCATION>. `` Our people are all positioned, they have signs and they know where to go,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertucelli </PERSON>, business representative for Local 732. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, which operates <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Northeast air shuttle and other services, needs labor concessions totaling around $ 540 million over three years to ensure its survival, analysts and company sources estimate. The Teamsters say they have offered $ 75 million in concessions over the next three years. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has sought an 8 percent wage cut per year, work rule changes and revisions to its health care plan. The Teamsters claim that the give-backs amount to a 15 percent to 17 percent wage cut for members, who make an average $ 480 a week and have not received a raise since 1981. Last month <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> last month rejected an offer from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to arbitrate the contract dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. By rejecting arbitration, <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> set in motion a federally mandated 30 - day `` cooling-off'' period between the two sides At the end of that time, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> would be free to impose its demands on the union, which in turn would be free to strike.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> signed into law Thursday bills giving top corporate officials greater protection from lawsuits filed by disgruntled stockholders. <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> had sought the legislation to enhance the state's business climate and to prevent some Maryland-based companies from moving their headquarters to neighboring states that offer such protection to officers and directors As of Jan. 1, some 35 states had enacted laws offering some degree of immunity from stockholder suits and are actively using such laws to sell their states to companies considering reincorporation, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>'s top legislative aide. `` This says something to business,'' <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said as he signed two identical bills passed at morning sessions of both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` It says we're interested in working together for the good of the state,'' he said. The measures are specifically aimed at lawsuits brought by stockholders who believe a business decision by an officer or director was responsible for a drop in the value of a company's stock Business leaders strongly supported the measures, telling lawmakers that skyrocketing liability insurance premiums have made it increasingly difficult to attract quality business people to serve on boards of directors. The <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> administration introduced a bill for the same purpose last year, but it was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, reportedly because 1987's version did not give stockholders the right to reject such immunity for its officers and directors. The bill signed Thursday requires formal ratification of the immunity provision by stockholders. The law also specifies that such protection does not apply to lawsuits brought by third parties. Under the new law, which went into effect immediately after <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> signed the bills, such immunity is lost when an officer or director receives an improper financial benefit or in cases involving deliberate dishonesty by a top corporate official.

<HEAD>Reagan Sees No Recession; Factory Use Flat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, proposing a $ 1.1 trillion federal budget on Thursday, predicted the economy would continue to grow without threat of recession. In other economic news, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the nation's industrial operating rate was unchanged in January at 82.2 percent of capacity, remaining at the highest level in almost eight years In the financial markets, the stock market gave ground in late trading Thursday and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped below 2,000, falling 14.58 to 1,986.41. Bond prices and the dollar edged higher. In its 1989 budget request, the administration foresaw no storm clouds on the economic horizon, contending growth would slow during the first half of 1988 but then rebound to robust levels in 1989 and beyond. The administration's economic forecasts, which provide the underpinning for its assumptions on revenues and spending in the budget, have been attacked in the past as rosy scenarios which bore little resemblance to reality. But this year's version was greeted with less skepticism, although it was still more optimistic than the outlook prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and most private economists. `` In the last couple of years, the administration has lightened the tint on their rose-colored glasses although their outlook is still a lot rosier than we think is justified,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an economic forecasting firm. The administration derided as greatly exaggerated recession fears stirred by the record 508-point drop in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average on Oct. 19 and contended the economy had escaped with `` few signs of serious damage.'' The administration predicted the gross national product, the total output of goods and services, would expand at a modest rate of 2.4 percent this year, down from 3.8 percent growth in 1987, when measured from the fourth quarter of 1986. Congressional analysts are forecasting lower growth of 1.8 percent in 1988 and <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said Data Resources has just scaled back its own GNP forecast to 1.4 percent, a full percentage point below the administration. In the capacity utilization report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said cutbacks in the production of steel and autos offset gains in other areas, the government reported Thursday. The January operating rate remained at the highest level in almost eight years, but it was the first month since September that the operating rate had failed to move up.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has assembled an ensemble of actors from the `` M-A-S-H'' television series for its advertising, said Thursday it has signed the star of that popular program. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alda </PERSON>, who starred as <PERSON> Hawkeye </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> in `` M-A-S-H,'' signed a multiyear agreement earlier this month to appear in commercials for the computer and office systems giant. The company declined to disclose how much <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> was being paid. The first ads featuring <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> will appear Saturday during <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s Olympics broadcasts, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said. He will initially appear alone in <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> ads. In one commercial, <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> paddles about a flooded office and describes how an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> service team worked without stop to restore a customer's computer operations. He says <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> can help customers face the future in another ad, and describes in a third commercial how the company can help businesses of all sizes. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, an advertising executive for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, said the company eventually plans to work <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> into ads that feature other former members of the `` M-A-S-H'' cast. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> launched advertising for its new family of Personal System 2 computers featuring seven former `` M-A-S-H'' cast members last April, including <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Burghoff </PERSON> who played <PERSON> Radar </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> who was Col. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Swit </PERSON> who played Hot Lips <PERSON> Houlihan </PERSON>. For <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, they played the roles of co-workers in an office. Conspicuously absent from that group was <PERSON> Alda </PERSON>, who reportedly was still under contract to another computer company, <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> had been interested in having <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> appear in its ads for some time, but that <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> had other commitments that were preventing it A call was placed to <PERSON> Alda </PERSON>'s agent, but was not returned. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> continues to be widely recognized and is well liked by the public although the `` M-A-S-H'' program creators and actors have disbanded and the show has gone into reruns. He said <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> has done little advertising and said his appearances for <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> occurred five years ago and should not diminish his effectiveness for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. `` You do n't have a sense that he is saying anything he does n't believe in,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a creative director for the ad agency Lord, <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Federico </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which created the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> ads <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said the ads using the former `` M-A-S-H'' actors have scored better than the industry average with the public. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has said that it did not set out to reassemble the `` M-A-S-H'' cast for its ads. Among those from that program who are missing from the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> ensemble are <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, who played Col. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> declined to speculate on whether any new characters would be added to the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> ads. `` Stay tuned for further developments,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it lost $ 245.5 million in the 1987 fourth quarter and $ 265.3 million for the year, blaming the results on labor costs, poor marketing, uncollectable bills and the airline's frequent-flier program. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's fastest-growing airlines, reported slightly lower fourth-quarter earnings but record earnings for the year, during which it acquired two other carriers <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s losses, reported against a background of labor-management feuding, an executive shakeup and an impending strike this weekend, bring the venerable airline company's losses to more than $ 883 million in the past four years. The quarterly loss was 24 percent higher than the $ 197.5 million loss in the same quarter of 1986, although the yearly loss was about 43 percent lower than the 1986 loss of $ 462.8 million. Still, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> officials expressed alarm. `` Last year's results are terribly disappointing for the company,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON>, who was elected chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> last month. `` A loss of this magnitude underscores the urgent need for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> to lower its current operating costs and revitalize its marketing and revenue-generating programs,'' <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> said in a statement. Fourth-quarter revenues totaled $ 877.1 million, up 9.8 percent from $ 798.6 million in the same quarter of 1986. For the year, revenues totaled $ 3.59 billion, up 18.2 percent from $ 3.04 billion in 1986. Aside from blaming labor costs, which are among the highest in the industry, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said the losses last year were aggravated by $ 42 million in `` increased allowances for inventory obsolescence, uncollectible receivables, and costs associated with the WorldPass frequent-flier program.'' Such programs, offered by all major carriers, attempt to gain repeat customers by offering them free trips after they fly a certain number of miles. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said its 1987 fourth-quarter earnings totaled $ 26.7 million or 62 cents a share, a 16.6 percent drop from the $ 32 million or $ 1.06 a share reported a year earlier. The company had 43.19 million shares outstanding in the 1987 quarter vs. 31.73 million a year earlier. Quarterly revenues totaled $ 1.12 billion, more than double the $ 483.38 million reported a year earlier. For all of 1987, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> said it earned a record $ 194.64 million or $ 5.28 a share, nearly double the $ 98.35 million or $ 3.34 a share earned in 1986. Revenues totaled a record $ 3 billion vs. $ 1.83 billion, a 63.5 percent gain. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> is an airline holding company that includes <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>. PSA was acquired in May 1987 and <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> was purchased in November 1987.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed Thursday his smallest <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> increase but sharply higher spending for AIDS research and airline safety in a $ 1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 budget that was largely pre-ordained in a deal with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` This budget does not fully reflect my priorities,'' the president said in his message accompanying the last spending plan he'll see through to completion. `` But ... abandoning the deficit reduction compromise would threaten our economic progress and burden future generations.'' The spending plan only hints of the `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution'' years as it strives to comply with the administration's agreement with congressional leaders last November to reduce the federal deficit. The agreement set overall spending limits for domestic, military and foreign aid spending. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has already signed the tax increase required under the agreement, adding $ 14 billion to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s receipts for next year. The president's plan envisions overall spending of $ 1.094 trillion, offset by $ 965 billion in receipts. That would leave a deficit of about $ 129.5 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, within the guidelines of the Gramm-Rudman, budget-balancing law and down from $ 150.4 billion last year and an estimated $ 146 billion this year. Because of the agreement with congressional leaders, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was forced for the first time to submit a military budget that would not keep pace with inflation. Restrained to $ 294 billion in outlays, up from $ 285.4 billion this year, the president proposed reducing the nation's active-duty forces and abandoning the goal of a 600-ship <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Servicemen and women would get a 4.3 percent pay increase, compared to 2 percent for other federal employees. On the domestic side of the ledger, the president requested new spending authority that he has resisted in the past but which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would likely favor anyway in an election year, including: _ $ 1.3 billion for AIDS research, a 38 percent increase. _ An increase of $ 1.5 billion, or 8 percent, on education _ A 13 percent boost, to $ 3.9 billion, for drug law enforcement and treatment programs _ $ 363 million to begin construction of the Superconducting Super Collider, a huge new atomic research facility. _ Full funding for a $ 2.5 billion, five-year program to combat acid rain, and an increase in spending on hazardous waste cleanup _ A 44 percent increase, to $ 1.6 billion, for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to modernize its air traffic control system _ $ 11.5 billion for space programs, including the manned space station and space shuttle improvements. The actual outlay would be $ 10.9 billion in 1989. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> offsets those increases by calling for an halt to <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> and mass transit subsidies, ending <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grants </ORGANIZATION>, and eliminating the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, government assets such as loan portfolios, the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> power administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would be sold. The president's budget director, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, told reporters that, even though <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has rejected many <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget proposals like asset sales in the past, he believed they would fare better this time. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to come up with these additional savings one way or another,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, suggesting that the cuts outlined in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget might be `` the course of least resistance for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said it was `` the intention of both the executive and legislative branches to honestly fulfill the terms of the budget agreement. It's a rather unique budget year.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his budget reflected the give-and-take of last fall's budget `` summit.'' `` In presenting this budget, I am keeping my end of the bargain. I call upon <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to uphold its end,'' he said. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would live within the agreement but `` there is obviously room for setting priorities in a different way than the president's budget proposes. The deputy Democratic leader in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was less generous. He said the failure to do more to tackle the deficit leaves `` an enormous problem to the next administration and to the next generation. It is a sad closing chapter to the failed story of Reaganomics.'' The administration predicts that if its budget is adopted deficits would continue to retreat from the record levels earlier in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term. When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981, the annual deficit was $ 78 billion, and he promised to bring the budget into balance within three years. Instead annual deficits nearly tripled by fiscal 1986. To stay below the $ 136 billion deficit target for fiscal 1989 in the Gramm-Rudman law, the budget includes $ 10 billion in revenue from selling government assets and other one-time receipts. But those sales are n't counted in Gramm-Rudman's calculations, because they are only temporary solutions. So the president technically failed to hit the $ 136 billion target, although not by the $ 10 billion margin that would trigger automatic spending cuts. The goals for future years are missed by the plan even by the president's own estimates. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he doubted either the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would face up to the continuing deficit problem this year `` This is the year of the big wink,'' he said. `` I do n't envy the president who will follow this administration because of the deficit he will inherit.'' The administration figures are based on projections that economic growth will continue undiminished by last fall's stock market collapse, and that inflation will ease. GNP growth will rebound in 1989 to a 3.5 percent rate and stay above 3 percent through 1993, according to the budget. Consumer prices, which rose 4.4 percent last year, will rise by 4.3 percent this year. The jobless rate of 5.8 percent will hold steady, according to the budget. The forecast is more optimstic than that of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and private economists, but not so far out of line with them as in past years. The chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees said they thought <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget was more realistic than his past efforts. `` I think it's a good faith budget,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee `` What we're doing now is working together,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chairman `` The president and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> compromised.'' Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, a member of the budget committee and co-sponsor of the Gramm-Rudman law, said the administration's deficit projections might be too optimistic, but `` no one's going to talk about it.'' The administration said if growth was even one percentage point less than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s forecast, the deficit would rise an additional $ 6.3 billion in 1989 and $ 18 billion in 1990. But <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> predicted this year's battles will be over the details, not the overall thrust of the budget or its deficit-reduction goals. `` It's like tying two cats by the tail and throwing them over the clothesline,'' he said. `` There'll be a lot of small intramurals, but nothing really's going to happen.''

 Children's television advocates in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> introduced legislation Thursday designed to rid the airwaves of programs that feature toy manufacturers' products as the central characters. `` Children's TV has been grossly overcommercialized,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure. `` You flip the dial and you'll find toys _ <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovelylocks </PERSON>, ThunderCats, Inhumanoids, GI <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> _ all starring in their own shows.'' Since the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 scrapped its commercial limits on children's TV shows, at least 70 programs that critics call `` program-length commercials'' have appeared on television, he said. Such programs are nothing more than `` sophisticated marketing strategies aimed at kids,'' he said. `` I just say that's absurd and it's wrong. The airwaves belong to the people of this country and they're being abused,'' he said at a news conference attended by other members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and organized by Action for Children's Television. The legislation was attacked by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, which called it `` anachronistic, unnecessary, inappropriate and ineffective,'' and said it raises First Amendment questions. The NAB said toy-based programs are not commercials and not subject to government regulation. `` Does the federal government want to eliminate the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, Sesame Street and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> programs?'' NAB said. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s bill would restore the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s previous guidelines that limited ads on children's shows to 9 -LCB- minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays. A similar House bill also would reinstate the limits and in addition would require TV stations to provide seven hours per week of educational programming for young viewers. `` We can make children's television better,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, D-Ill., who co-sponsored the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure with Reps. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, in response to a federal appeals court ruling last June, is reviewing its children's TV policies and is considering whether ad limits are needed and whether toy-based shows constitute program-length commercials. But <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will not wait for the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to act. `` The commission clearly has demonstrated that it can not be trusted to protect children from commercial exploitation,'' said <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, who has crossed swords with the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> over many broadcasting issues. `` When it comes to children's programming, this commission has never found an offensive practice that it did not like.'' <PERSON> Charren </PERSON> said her group has been concerned for years that commercial considerations dominate programming decisions regarding children's TV, making it difficult to get stations to devote time to educational and informational shows for kids. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Boise </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes a dozen different toys on which cartoon shows are based, said the programs are not commercials because the toys themselves are not shown and ads for the toys never appear during or adjacent to the program featuring the toy's cartoon character. `` It's an entertainment concept,'' he said. `` The characters are shown in cartoon or animated form, not static form like the toys.'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said the content of many of the toy-based programs for children would be classified as commercial time and, with ad limitations in place, would be driven off the air. `` There will be certain clear areas where it will be indisputably evident to all who witness it that a seamless fabric connecting commercials to program content has been developed,'' he said. `` We may reach some gray areas where there is a more open question, but clearly there is going to be an overwhelming consensus in the bulk of the areas ... that will be very difficult for anyone to deny that products are actually seeking to be promoted as part of the program content,'' he said.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said the economy was shrugging off the impact of the October stock market collapse and would enjoy modest growth this presidential election year with no threat of a recession. In its 1989 budget request released Thursday, the administration foresaw no storm clouds on the economic horizon, contending that growth would slow during the first half of 1988 but then rebound to robust levels in 1989 and beyond. The administration predicted the gross national product, the total output of goods and services, would expand at a modest rate of 2.4 percent this year, down from 3.8 percent growth in 1987, when measured from the fourth quarter of 1986.

 The nation's industrial operating rate was unchanged in January at 82.2 percent of capacity as cutbacks in the production of steel and autos offset gains in other areas. The January operating rate reported by the government Thursday remained at the highest level in almost eight years, but it was the first month since September that the operating rate had failed to move up. Some economists suggested this provided further evidence of an impending slowdown.
