 Police fired tear gas grenades and rubber bullets Sunday to disperse hundreds of stone-throwing Arabs on the biblical Via <LOCATION> Dolorosa </LOCATION> in the walled Old City of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. At least eight people were injured, witnesses said. Massive police reinforcements were rushed to the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

The riot was one of the most serious in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule started nearly seven months ago.

 A strong earthquake shook northern <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> on Sunday. Police said it unleashed rockslides that injured 13 people. They said the injured people were hit by falling rocks at three waterfall tourist sites in suburban <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. The quake, measuring 5.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, set off rock avalanches in an area covering 1,200 square yards, authorities said. The injured, who were all Taiwanese, were taken to a hospital, police said. One was reported to be in serious condition, and the others suffered only minor injuries. The Central Weather Bureau placed the epicenter of the early-afternoon earthquake in <LOCATION> Sanchi </LOCATION>, a coastal village about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. The earthquake was felt in the capital, where residents reported their houses shook violently, the bureau said. The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a ten-fold increase in intensity. An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause serious damage in a populated area, and one of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> announced it has developed a new, more powerful rocket in its successful Long March series and said it soon will launch a meteorological satellite into space. The new Long March 4 has a propelling power of 300 tons and the capability of putting a 2.5-ton payload into orbit, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said late Saturday. Aeronautics officials hope the new rocket will help attract more foreign customers for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s nearly 3-year-old satellite launch service, which despite cut-rate prices has only one customer under contract. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has launched 22 of its own satellites in the past 18 years using the Long March 1, 2 and 3 rockets. Most recently, the Long March 3 sent a communications satellite into orbit that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said would double domestic communications capacity. The Long March 3 was introduced in April 1984. It can put up to 1.4-ton load in long-distance orbit and up to 3 tons in low-altitude orbit. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report quoted <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shouchun </PERSON>, chief engineer of the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s launch company, as saying the No. 3 rocket uses advanced low-temperature technology applied in only a few other countries. He did not give any details about the new Long March 4. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said in November that scientists had modified the Long March 3 to nearly double its launch capabilities. It was not clear if that modified version was the same as the Long March 4. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> announced its international launch service in October 1985, hoping to take advantage of the halt in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle and European launching programs caused by accidents. The <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has reported numerous inquiries from potential foreign customers, but only one, <ORGANIZATION> Sweden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has signed a formal contract. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> agreed in December to launch a scientific and telecommunications satellite for <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> using the Long March 2.

 At least 100,000 Slovak Roman Catholics converged on a remote hillside Sunday in a show of religious strength 40 years after the Communist takeover. The pilgrims thronged the <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Levoca </LOCATION>, an eastern Slovak town of 11,000 about 25 miles from the Polish border. Some said they walked up to 125 miles. Pilgrims and some independent observers said that up to 200,000 people may have attended the pilgrimage, which began Friday and is an annual event started more than 200 years ago. `` Interest in religion before our very eyes is growing,'' <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garaj </PERSON>, the apostolic administrator of <LOCATION> Spiss </LOCATION> diocese, told the crowd at an open air Mass. Thousands arrived Friday and stayed through Sunday for 20 hours of Masses, prayer sessions and singing that climaxed with Sunday's open air Mass <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s Catholics have been buoyed by the recent consecration of two auxiliary bishops in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and bishop <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokol </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Trnava </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>'s largest diocese. The church has also been strengthened by a petition signed by about 600,000 people calling for religious freedom and the appointment of new bishops. About 60 percent of the 15.5 million residents of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are Roman Catholics, according to church officials. Most of them are Slovaks. <PERSON> Garaj </PERSON> hailed Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> as `` the greatest pilgrim of our century.'' The pope was not at the pilgrimage. Many worshipers spent the night in tents. Elderly Slovak women knelt in the mud hours after a downpour had soaked the ground. Groups of young people trekked up and down the hill led by youths carrying wooden crosses. Attendance at the <LOCATION> Levoca </LOCATION> pilgrimage dropped during the 1950s but began to pick up again in 1968 during a brief liberalization attempt in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. It was crushed when Soviet tanks intervened. Attendance has been growing since then. Police watched the crowd climb the hill on three different treks but did not interfere. An unspecified number of plainclothes police were said to be observing the rites. The recent appointment of bishops came after 15 years in which the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> government and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> failed to agree on candidates acceptable to both sides. None of the three new bishops is a member of Pacem in <LOCATION> Terris </LOCATION>, a pro-government clergymen's organization banned by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>.

But <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> added that Democratic unity is likely to prove short-lived and that special interests will reassert themselves if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins the White House in the fall. `` The day they win, <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> bar the door,'' he said. That's a problem Democrats will worry about if and when the time comes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has made a number of largely symbolic concessions to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> since the primary season ended, and party officials are crowing about the relatively smooth transition between the primary campaign and the convention. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who will have the support of more 1,100 delegates at the convention, has said repeatedly that he deserves a vice presidential offer, and that he has decided whether he would accept one but wo n't say what his decision is. He and his wife will have dinner at the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> home on Monday, and the topic of the vice presidency is expected to come up. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is widely expected by his aides to select a different running mate, and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor frequently quotes <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s earlier statements that a nominee is entitled to make his own pick. Other Democrats say they doubt <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will raise a furor if he is passed over, although there has been no clue about what might happen if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chooses a political partner whom <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finds offensive. `` I think he has been and will be very positive no matter what happens,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman who challenged for the presidential nomination last winter. With the exception of the vice presidential nomination, this year's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign has been remarkably free of the types of disputes that produced divisions in earlier conventions. This year: _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wrapped up the nomination on the final day of the primaries, and unlike in 1980 and 1984 no one has questioned his control over a majority of delegates. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has continued to campaign publicly, occasionally sniping at the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, but thus far has never suggested summoning his forces for an all-out fight such as the one Kennedy waged in 1980. The other, losing contenders generally have endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> warmly and most of them are expected to speak at the convention, although <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> will be in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> writing a newspaper column and offering commentary for an Italian television audience. _ Democratic draftsmen came up with the shortest platform in decades, in keeping with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' desires and <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s hope of avoiding a `` litany of social, cultural or ideological buzzwords.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> yielded to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on some issues, notably his desire to brand <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state and his call for periodic increases in the federal minimum wage to keep pace with inflation. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has described the platform as bland, and his aides have filed a dozen minority planks for possible votes at the convention. But <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> says, `` If there are planks that will be discussed and debated it will be a civil agreement to disagree.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides sound almost like they welcome a floor vote to demonstrate their stand against higher taxes and a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> freeze, two key <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> demands. `` There may be some fights and that's a normal part of the process and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will stick to his position,'' says <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, the campaign's communications director. _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> agreed to several concessions sought by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on party rules covering the 1992 campaign. That mollified <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> without costing this year's winner anything. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will not care about the selection of delegates in 1992 if he loses this year _ and wo n't have to worry about it if he wins and is running for re-election. Thus, he agreed to a sharp reduction in the number of automatic super delegates who will attend the 1992 convention, the party officials who have overwhelmingly favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> this year. He also consented to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s demand to award all other delegates in 1992 in proportion to the vote received in primaries. _ All potential credentials challenges were ironed out between the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces, averting a floor fight. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> picked up eight new delegates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>; six in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and three in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> in the process. Most of them came from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has more than he needs.

<HEAD>As Spending Limit Looms, Bush `Party Builds' and GOP Picks Up the
Tab</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was talking about crime and politics and Democrats versus Republicans, sounding for all the world like the presidential candidate he is. But something was missing _ there was no specific mention of his Democratic rival, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The reason _ this <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> speech was not a campaign trip, it was a `` party building'' mission paid for by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. The semantic distinction _ in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacks liberals or Democrats but not <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by name _ has allowed the vice president to take several trips on the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> tab at a time when his own campaign funds are virtually gone. Since the primaries ended June 7, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken nine out-of-state swings, five of them at least partially financed by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The practice is legal under <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> guidelines, but demonstrates a loophole the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp has found to keep his campaign in the public eye. Democrats accuse <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of sleight of checkbook to circumvent the law that places a $ 23 million ceiling on primary campaign spending. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is pushing the limit, having spent $ 21.3 million by the beginning of June. He severely cut back on campaign spending to avoid surpassing the cap before the Republican National Convention Aug. 15-18. The <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> will be pitching in to help with expenses once the convention declares <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the nominee, but can give him no more than $ 5,000 while he is still technically a primary candidate. That's where party building has come in handy. The <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> can spend whatever it wants to help its <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates and state party organizations around the country. Such spending logically includes sending a sitting vice president on speech-making tours to help promote the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> cause, says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman Ede Holiday. `` He's got a proven track record as one of the best fund-raisers in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said, adding that the party would utilize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> even if he was not a presidential candidate. It's not so much his dual role, however, as the financial arrangements that explain why sometimes his talks are peppered with criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his certain opponent in November, and other times laced only with general attacks on Democrats. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> fund-raising luncheon on Thursday: `` I am under these constraints because this is a party-building event. That means I can not put in perspective the differences between me and the man I'll be running against.'' He then proceeded with a lively attack on liberals in a clearly coded reference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` You can call it party building, but it's campaigning,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anbender </PERSON>. `` When the vice president is the certain presidential nominee and is traveling around the country, it is fairly evident that ... his primary purpose is to promote his candidacy.'' `` If he does n't talk about his opponent, it's not a campaign trip,'' countered <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign attorney <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>. `` The Republicans are being very careful not to do this one wrong. If there's any question they allocate it to the campaign.'' Once the Republican convention nominates him in August, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will get an infusion of $ 46 million from the federal Treasury for his campaign and the Democratic nominee will get the same amount. In addition, the national parties are allowed to spend $ 8.3 million each on their nominees. Even trips to raise the $ 8.3 million are not necessarily considered campaign-related by the Republicans because the $ 8.3 million _ while designated to help elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ is party money rather than campaign money, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. Any RNC spending on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before the convention is not counted against the $ 8.3 million because he is not the nominee yet. Despite Democratic frustration, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> practice `` is totally within the statutes and the regulations,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. She said the law `` recognizes the double or triple functions and double or triple hats a that a candidate may wear.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forces are quick to point out that they are not charging any of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s travel in this post-primary period to the taxpayers, even when he is invited to speak in his vice presidential capacity. In those cases, the campaign has scheduled fund-raising events in the same state so the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> can pick up the tab. Even his <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two plane expenses are charged to the campaign to avoid charges of using his office. The campaign is particularly sensitive on the issue, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said, in light of a complaint filed against President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaign when he charged a Veterans of Foreign Wars speech to the White House budget rather than the campaign The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> decision that there was no violation in that case is the subject of an ongoing federal court case.

<HEAD>New Orleans: Not Just A Great Place To Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Six weeks before the Republican National Convention, officials here are doing everything they can to avoid the problems that have been reported in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, convention city of the Democrats. City officials desperately want to show the world that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is a good place to do business, not just a great place to party. `` We have never had this kind of opportunity before and I think the people have basically responded,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>. After a rocky start, the civic machinery is humming along for the Aug. 15-18 convention. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, by contrast, persistent reports of poor planning and confusion are marring the road to the July 18-21 Democratic gathering. `` Not Ready For Prime Time'' barked the headline about <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in one national newsmagazine last week. It's the kind of spotlight <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> officials have been working all year to avoid. The city is no stranger to Big Events: annual Mardi Gras street parties, six Super Bowls, a papal visit and the 1984 World's Fair. But this is different. The convention comes at a time when the city is reeling from an economic depression caused by a slump in the oil industry. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a local businessman and vice chairman of the host committee, sees the convention as a major step toward helping the city and state recover from the oil slump, which sent unemployment rates in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> soaring to the highest in the nation. `` We have an opportunity with this convention to change how the people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> perceive the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and the state of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> and others are hoping the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> meeting will rid the city once and for all of any negative feelings left over from the 1984 World's Fair. Although the fair was a great party, it was a financial flop that drew mostly negative publicity. Bad press started the day before it opened, and stories of its financial problems and lawsuits followed. `` There were never any logistical problems with the World's Fair,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said `` The problem was not enough good publicity, and not enough people came to it.'' When the national media shows up this time, organizers will have 10,000 volunteer workers to make sure delegates, reporters and convention guests find everything in place. `` We want to see that everything is ready from hotels and night spots, down to the little man in his house who's being asked to hang a flag out,'' Councilwoman <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. A $ 280,000 message center will be set up in the Superdome, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Computer terminals in the major hotels will allow delegates and reporters to check messages from various points in the city. Two fund-raising groups are raising the $ 5.5 million <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> agreed to put up when it signed the contract to host the convention. `` We ca n't afford another tax,'' <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> said. `` We had to go another route so we're asking for contributions.'' Collections got off to a slow start, but by the third week of June, 60 percent of the money had been raised, according to <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and head fund-raiser. Convention Manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> says he's not worried about the city's ability to pay. `` I'm not concerned about the city living up to its obligations, they have met every one of them on time,'' he said. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> also said he sees no reason to worry yet about another possible snag, a police organization's demands that the city enter into a collective bargaining agreement. `` In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1984 the police and the taxi drivers both said they were going to strike if something was n't agreed upon and neither did,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. `` The city has said they're talking with the police association and it's coming along. It's a wait and see.'' A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> study says the convention will have a $ 137 million impact on the local economy, but local officials think the long-range impact is far more important. `` This is a wonderful chance to show the city off,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` We want to make sure we take full advantage of it. `` We're paying very close attention to all the details.''

 A man has asked a court whether he can keep $ 160,200 in $ 100 bills that his aunt wrapped as a Christmas gift and gave to him before killing herself. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s aunt had been accused of defrauding <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of about $ 180,000, police said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> took a brown grocery sack of money to <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Friday and turned it over until a judge rules on its ownership.

<HEAD>Despite Market Crash, Congress Stalled on Stock Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are drifting into the waning days of this year's session gridlocked in a struggle to pass legislation addressing the continuing woes of the securities industry. News from the stock market over the last several months raises the kinds of issues <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> usually pounces on quickly: One trillion dollars in equity values vanish overnight in history's worst stock market crash. Billions of dollars go up for grabs in an endless series of corporate takeover battles. Insider trading scams net millions of dollars in illegal profits. Yet, no bills are even close to passage. Congressional offices have files fat with testimony they've collected at hearings on Wall Street's problems But most lawmakers and lobbyists seem convinced that the chances of any major legislation being enacted in 1988 are increasingly remote. `` I'm unhappy about it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., who is retiring from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next year and has made stock market legislation a priority in his final months in office `` But there's not much I can do.'' Turf fights have slowed the proposals, as regulatory agencies, securities exchanges and even congressional committees with market jurisdiction struggle to expand or retain powers they now have. Deeper divisions exist, however, over the very need for new laws. The growing influence of the futures markets, increasingly common dramatic price swings and hostile takeovers are villains to some. But others say they are little more than inevitable changes that do more good than harm and that legislation could not control anyway. `` No one is for the crash,'' said executive director <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Teslik </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION>, which represents large pension funds. `` It would be lovely to say, ` Here are the problems.' But is there a problem?'' The measures that have been introduced are ambitious attempts to stifle what their sponsors say is abusive, unbridled behavior that threatens the nation's economy. One <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> bill, a response to last October's stock market collapse, would tighten federal regulation of the stock, futures and options exchanges. An <ORGANIZATION> Intermarket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would be formed, consisting of the chiefs of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The committee would create `` circuit breakers'' to automatically shut down trading if wild price swings occur, and make a range of changes designed to dampen speculation and enhance information gathering by the exchanges. A second Proxmire measure attempts to clamp down on corporate raiders by forcing them to make their takeover efforts more public. A third bill, introduced last Thursday by Rep. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, D-Va., would require brokerage firms to set up systems to weed out insider trading, and offer bounties to people who tell the authorities about the leaking of privileged information All three proposals face imposing hurdles in a year in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has only about 50 work days left, and in which lawmakers are becoming increasingly distracted by the political campaigns. The market regulation legislation has yet to make it out of <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>'s own committee and has still not been introduced in the House. It has run into opposition from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, many lawmakers, federal regulators and market officials, who question whether any changes are needed. And its supporters have lost momentum as the crash recedes further into the past. `` It's a case of everyone sort of stumbling around and in the meantime the problem seems to be going away,'' says <PERSON> A.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a lawyer who monitors Capitol Hill for business groups. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> brought his corporate raider bill to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor last month, only to see his colleagues vote to attach what he calls killer amendments, provisions that would help raiders by limiting the defenses corporate managers could use. The surprised lawmaker pulled the bill off the floor and says he still has n't decided what he'll do next. The insider trading legislation may have the best chance of passage, especially with last week's new charges against an investor and a trader accused of earning $ 19 million in illegal profits. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee and a co-sponsor of <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>'s bill, says the insider trading measure is his `` best bet'' for action As <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heard </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consultant to financial institutions, argues, `` There's nobody who's against stronger enforcement or tightening up insider trading laws.'' But <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> and his allies still need to sell their proposal to their colleagues, who will have numerous measure competing for their attention as the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> winds down. Even if the securities bills are not approved in 1988, lawmakers pressing the legislation are succeeding in keeping the stock market issue in the news and getting public reaction to their ideas. `` We may not be able to get everything passed this year, but we'll set the stage for next year,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>JVC Latin Jazz Concert A Fitting Tribute To Machito</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The great Cuban jazz musician <PERSON> Machito </PERSON> died in 1986, but the <ORGANIZATION> JVC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>'s tribute to him provided ample evidence that the Afro-Cuban jazz tradition <PERSON> Machito </PERSON> fathered is strong and well. On Saturday night, <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> resounded with the salsa and jazz of <PERSON> Mongo </PERSON> <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paquito </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Rivera </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> and <PERSON> Celia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> in a concert that underscored the continuing vibrancy of <PERSON> Machito </PERSON>'s legacy. <PERSON> Machito </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in the late 1930s and is generally credited with being the first to combine Cuban rhythms with jazz melodies and harmonies. Among the members of <PERSON> Machito </PERSON>'s early orchestras was a young drummer named <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, who ultimately launched his own big band after World War II and has become one of the biggest names in Latin music. <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> appeared with his big band Saturday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Machito </ORGANIZATION> tribute, where he performed with all the vigor of the young man who once worked for <ORGANIZATION> Machito </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>'s music is a true salsa-jazz fusion, seamlessly mixing jazz-inflected horn arrangements with a churning Latin rhythm section. While the Latin rhythmic groove was paramount in everything <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> played, he also revealed an introspective side with a silky, mysterious performance of `` Autumn Leaves,'' which he played on vibraphone. <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> followed a rousing opening set by <PERSON> Mongo </PERSON> <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON>, whose smaller band revealed crisp, clean rhythms and taught arrangements. <PERSON> Santamaria </PERSON> was followed, in turn, by the Cuban-American alto saxophonist <PERSON> Paquito </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Rivera </PERSON>, who has brought Latin music to a wider audience of jazz afficionados. <PERSON> D'Rivera </PERSON>'s quartet opened with a deft interpretation of `` All The Things You Are,'' and later welcomed <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON>, the Puerto Rican flute player, for a guest spot. In one of the few apparent instances of poor planning during the concert, <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> was ushered off the stage after only one selection, just as he was warming to the sound of the concert hall. <PERSON> D'Rivera </PERSON> also introduced to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> a young Brazilian singer and guitarist named <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Caram </PERSON>, who performed two breezy numbers that revealed a supple if slightly hyperkinetic vocal style and a considerable talent as a guitarist. The high point of the evening came with the appearance of <PERSON> Celiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, the great salsa singer whose 35 years in the business earned her a standing ovation before she began to sing. She delivered several selections in a deep, powerful voice before all of the evening's musicians gathered on stage for a freewheeling performance of `` Machito Forever,'' a Puente composition.

 The Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is bragging about a session of unusual productivity, although the circumstances that have helped make that possible may soon be gone. `` We think it is probably the most productive <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in recent history,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said. The record backs up that statement. _ For the first time in years, the House has passed all 13 of the annual spending bills on time When the final two measures were voted on Wednesday, it was the earliest that had been done in 28 years. _ The catastrophic health insurance bill, signed into law Friday by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, is the biggest change in the Medicare system since the program began 23 years ago _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratified the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ After a seemingly endless partisan battle over aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels through most of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle approved a non-weapons aid package _ Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have approved bills to overhaul the nation's welfare laws, and an agreement between the two chambers is being negotiated _ The housing aid programs have been renewed, and after years of stalemate, a compromise has been struck on toughening the nation's laws against discrimination in `` Those are some pretty significant things done in this <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' conceded Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, the House Republican leader. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> was also quick to point out that Republicans `` played a meaningful role'' in those accomplishments. Still on the agenda are <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> completion of the spending bills, a pre-election anti-drug bill, and another veto fight with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> over trade and a companion plant-closing notification bill. And lawmakers are talking optimistically about finishing the session on time in the first week of October. `` The reason we have been productive is because we have a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. After six years of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> control, Democrats won back the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the 1986 election. But crediting a unified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as the main reason for the legislative success would be misleading. Last year, when both chambers were <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION>, not one of the annual spending bills was finished on time. The most important reason <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was able to move speedily this year was last fall's deficit-reduction pact with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, which set in advance the overall spending levels Another reason for this year's success has been just-departed White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. The former senator's non-confrontational style, and his work directly with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to iron out wrinkles, helped keep the process moving on several occasions `` This illustrates that there is nothing wrong with the budget process that a cooperative president can not fix,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> himself, of course, is in his final months in office. Like other presidents after a long tenure, he has been concentrating on foreign policy initiatives, including the summits with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Meanwhile, domestic programs have regained some of the attractiveness in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that was tarnished in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s early years of anti-big-government rhetoric. `` It's in large measure due to the fact that it's an election year,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif. Republicans, too, are voting for measures that `` members can point to as establishing their credibility on a broad range of domestic issues. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s chief vote-counter, Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., said that while Republicans have complained about the sometimes strong-arm tactics of the Democrats to keep the schedule moving, members of both parties were tired of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' traditionally chaotic approach `` You have an atmosphere for strong leadership,'' he said. `` But if the leadership was n't willing to take advantage of that, it would n't happen. ... We are always working the system _ It's hands-on. The test of whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is running better will come next year. Although most observers expect <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will remain in Democratic control, there will be a new president ambitiously pursuing an agenda that may not jive with that of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and the budget summit with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be a memory. `` I'm not so naive as to think we wo n't fall back into the same old syndrome,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will again have a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> opponent _ and one with more vigor. If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins, there could be a clash of the expectations that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have pent up in the past eight years and the huge national debt that has built up. `` We have begun to reverse the trend that was eroding and beginning to do away with our domestic infrastructure,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. A <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> victory would also take away <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s much-enjoyed role as the top elected Democrat in the country, an adjustment some associates say might be difficult for him. Another adjustment will come by next year when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics investigation against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who is accused of using his elective office for financial gains, should be completed. If <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is found to have done wrong, it could shake up the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has declared his innocence, and has called the current probe wearying. But the ethics case is also a useful distraction for the right-wing opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which is spending more time attacking the speaker and less time sabotaging the legislative schedule. `` I do n't think I intended it that way,'' chuckled <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Why a Drought?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Meteorologists know that a stalled high pressure system and a split jet stream are causing the drought in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but they are at a loss to explain why the phenomena occurred and when they might end. In a high-pressure system, also known as an anticyclone, dry air gradually descends toward the ground and moves in a clockwise pattern around the center. It is the opposite of a cyclone, where rising, moist, counterclockwise winds promote the development of clouds, and thus rain. As followers of newspaper weather maps and broadcast reports know, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s changing weather pattern generally consists of a series of highs and lows _ anticyclones and cyclones _ marching across the country from west to east. That pattern is stalled, has been for a month or more, and is likely to stay stalled, according to <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Long-Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Predictions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. In normal times, the highs and lows, and their accompanying weather fronts, are steered across the nation by strong, high-altitude winds known as the jet stream. Tearing across the nation's middle and southern sections in winter, these winds pull along the major storms that many people dread. When warm summer weather comes, the jet stream usually edges to the north. There, it brings in moisture from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, while at the same time helping pull storms north into the nation's middle from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Not so this year, <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> said. The jet stream has split in two. One stream is sweeping to the north in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, steering <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> storms north of the Farm Belt. The second is moving across just south of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, blocking gulf storms from coming north. And trapped in the middle is that dismally warm and sunny anticyclone. This split is `` not a rare event, if you define rare as something that almost never happens. But it's not frequent either,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Livezey </PERSON>, an associate of <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>'s at the federal Climate Analysis Center. Can he say why it occurs? `` Unfortunately not. The processes which lead to this sort of event are n't well understood right now,'' <PERSON> Livezey </PERSON> said. It may simply be part of the natural variability of the atmosphere, he said. At any rate, the meteorologists are n't ready to attribute it to any specific cause. `` That's one of the problems in dynamic meteorology that we're still working on Figuring out how -LRB- these patterns occur -RRB- is one of the keys to long-range forecasting,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabol </PERSON> of the Climate Analysis Center. Even determining whether the high caused the jet stream to split, or the split jet stream trapped the high, is difficult, <PERSON> Livezey </PERSON> said. At any rate, the two work together. The high blocks the movement of storms into the Farm Belt while the jet stream guides them around it. Once that pattern starts, the hot, dry weather tends to worsen and reinforce itself, said <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kousky </PERSON>, also of the Climate Analysis Center. `` Everybody has felt the cooling sensation when water evaporates after they get out of the ocean or a pool,'' he explained. In the same way, `` If you have wet ground, some of the solar radiation is used to evaporate water, the area is kept cooler and this is good for man and plants as well.'' The drought, however, has reduced ground moisture. Without the cooling of evaporation, and the clouds that the evaporated water might eventually form, the weather can get hotter and hotter. `` You might call it a drought feedback mechanism, it tends to perpetuate on itself,'' <PERSON> Kousky </PERSON> said. When it will end, no one was willing to say. `` There is no normal lifetime of a drought. They can last from several months to years,'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> noted in a statement on the drought. `` Unfortunately, reliable predictions of the drought's end, its geographic spread, or changes in severity, can not be made today,'' the service said. In his long-range forecast, <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> called for the current weather pattern to continue, at least through July. The most intense focus of the drought may drift to the east and south in the next three months, he said. But the pattern of rainfall behind it will be spotty, he said, with only the western parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> likely to see much increase in rain through the end of September. Whether that will be in time to save threatened crops remains to be seen.

<HEAD>Ozal Inaugurates Second Bridge Over Bosporus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> on Sunday inaugurated the second bridge linking <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and was the first to cross it after a ritual sheep sacrifice opened the ceremony. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> called the eight-lane suspension bridge across the Bosporus strait `` a monument symbolizing friendship and cooperation between <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.'' The bridge was built by a consortium of Japanese, Italian and Turkish companies. The Turkish premier then drove his car 14 miles from Levent on the European side to <LOCATION> Kozyatagi </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolian </ORGANIZATION> side, followed by hundreds of vehicles. The bridge's main span reaches 3,597 feet and is about 192 feet above the strait. It is the sixth longest suspension bridge in the world. Thousands of people crowded nearby hills to watch the inauguration ceremony, which opened after the sheep sacrifice, an Islamic ritual. Dozens of helicopters hovered and thousands of police and soldiers enforced tight security measures following reports of sabotage threats by Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> terrorists. The $ 123 million bridge was built in 2 -LCB- years by <ORGANIZATION> Ishikawajima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Nippon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kokan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> K.K </LOCATION>. of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Impregilo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.P.A. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Sezai </PERSON> <PERSON> Turkes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fevzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Akkaya </PERSON> Turkish construction company. In addition to the bridge, 111 miles of highways will be constructed, starting from <LOCATION> Kinali </LOCATION> near the Greek border in the west, passing through <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> and ending in <LOCATION> Sakarya </LOCATION> in the east. An additional 24 miles of peripheral roads will be built. The total cost of the project, including the bridge, is estimated at $ 551 million. The new bridge is three miles north of the first bridge over the Bosporus, which stretches from <LOCATION> Hisarustu </LOCATION> on the European side to <LOCATION> Kavacik </LOCATION> on the Anatolian side. The new bridge was built because of increased traffic over the strait. between the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But the traffic will not be significantly eased until the peripheral roads are completed by the end of this year, officials said. The daily traffic volume over the first bridge, which opened in 1973, reached more than 130,000 vehicles in 1987, according to a Highways Directorate report. The report said 426 million vehicles had crossed the bridge by November 1987.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> emerged from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s first national conference in nearly 50 years with political reforms he championed, but he also endured hostility toward his drive for more openness. Such was the mixed scorecard of the four-day conference that ended Friday. The 5,000 delegates met in the party's first conference since <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> convened one in 1941. At <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s urging, they ordered an overhaul of the late dictator's system that vested the nation's power and prestige in the party's bureaucrats. By charting the path of political reform, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> conclave pointed the way to a new `` democratic image of socialism'' that would enable his economic and social reforms to proceed. Resolutions adopted at the conference _ on topics including political reform, the openness policy known as `` glasnost,'' and inter-ethnic relations _ were not immediately made public. But a preliminary scorecard can be drawn based on delegates' speeches, reports in the state-run media and officials' comments to reporters. _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself looks like a winner He gained his mandate for political change and led the kind of frank, often searing debate he espouses. The disputes starkly contrasted with the polite, well-ordered ceremonial conferences of past <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> rulers. Among their political reforms, the delegates approved creating a new, more powerful presidency with powers to draft legislation and oversee foreign policy and defense _ a post apparently tailor-made for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. However, some delegates to the conference said they were awaiting proof that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reform program, in its third year, will improve life. Until the fine print of the resolutions is made public, it would be premature to call the conference an unqualified triumph for the 57-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. _ <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the No 2 Kremlin leader often rumored to be at odds with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, also appeared to have gained ground. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s extraordinary speech, in which he disavowed any ideological differences with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, amounted to a ringing defense of the party's Old Guard and a stinging blow to his would-be rival, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. _ <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the one-time protege of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss, came away from the conference a loser He asked delegates for `` political rehabilitation'' and instead culled attacks from a succession of speakers, including <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was stripped of his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party post last year and an alternate seat on the ruling Politburo in February after complaining that entrenched bureaucrats were blocking <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has some good ideas and is energetic but that he lacks tact and has been rude. Segments from <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s speech and from the frequently acidic attacks on him were shown on national television, apparently to nip any vestiges of popular support for him. _ President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and fellow long-time Politburo member <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON>, both in their 70s, may have also come away losers In a rare public attack, one delegate called them and two other senior party figures holdovers from the `` period of stagnation,'' as the era of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> is now known. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> also attacked <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> by name, accusing him of protecting corrupt party officials. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, however, defended his Politburo colleagues, saying they helped engineer the election of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as party chief in March 1985. In addition, the conference raised questions about the future of some groups affected by its decisions: _ The journalists known as the `` glasnost gang,'' the most outspoken advocates of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s openness campaign, may have suffered a setback <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, editor of the weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Grigory </PERSON> <PERSON> Baklanov </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Znamya </LOCATION> literary monthly, met a chilly, sometimes hostile reception. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had to intervene twice to silence delegates so <PERSON> Baklanov </PERSON> could finish speaking. The editor of the government daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Laptev </PERSON>, was also jeered from the floor. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proclaimed that `` openness has been the hero of the conference.'' But <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> specifically endorsed some sentiments in a speech by a conservative writer who denounced recent daring press forays into the Soviet past and present. _ Party bureaucrats, from the countryside to the senior leadership, suffered All party officeholders will now be limited to two five-year terms. Before, they could serve for life. It was also clear that local party leaders will lose their jobs if they can not muster enough support to be chosen as chairmen of the country's 50,000 local governing councils. _ Finally, the 20 million members of the party rank and file, whose qualifications will be reviewed this year, face uncertainty A reevaluation of their standing could be used to blunt conservative opposition to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms.

<TEXT>
 About 3,000 nurses walked off the job Sunday to protest a government health plan they say will increase the burden on already understaffed hospitals. Also Sunday, 900 workers of Magen <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Adom </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s version of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, shut down services after failing to receive June paychecks. And physicians who have been staging short strikes for several months closed out-patient clinics and performed only emergency surgery. The doctors also oppose the government's health proposal, which calls for shortening the waiting list for operations by introducing a second daily surgery shift. <PERSON> Ilana </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, head of the nurses' union, said the government should first substantially increase the number of public hospital nurses. There are now about 12,000. `` It's inconceivable that they should talk about a second shift when the nurses can hardly cope with the first shift,'' she said. She said the 12,000 nurses will take turns striking. Groups of 3,000 nurses will rotate taking two-week `` vacations.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s debt-ridden hospital system has been plagued for the past two years by strikes and walkouts. The government says more than 22,000 people have been waiting months for elective surgery, and medical unions say the number is 50,000. The new health plan calls for medical staff to do 15,000 operations in the next nine months. A committee consisting of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, Deputy Premier <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, Finance Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON> and Health Minister <PERSON> Shoshana </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbeli-Almoslino </PERSON> has been named to propose a solution to the health crisis.

 Administration sources said it was `` doubtful'' that the plane shot down by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces Sunday was an Iranian F-14 fighter, and that the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> were trying to determine whether it was a civilian airliner, as claimed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` It is doubtful that an F-14 was up there at all,'' said an administration source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces had shot down an Iranian fighter jet over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and that officials were `` checking out'' an Iranian report that an American-fired missile had downed an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jetliner carrying 290 passengers. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, Adm. <PERSON> Wiliam </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, was to brief reporters on the matter early this afternoon. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are ` aware of the Iranian claim, of the press reports of it, and we're checking it out.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman said the president had been kept informed of `` the incidents in the Gulf.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Air jetliner took off from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> at 10:15 a.m. -LRB- 2:45 a.m. EDT -RRB- and was last tracked 7 minutes later. The agency said 100 bodies had been recovered and all aboard the jetliner were feared killed when two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles hit it. Major <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said hostilities began in the gulf Sunday when an Iranian gunboat fired at a helicopter at 2:10 a.m. EDT. He said the helicopter was not hit and that the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and the frigate USS Montgomery returned fire, sinking two Iranian boats and downing a F-14 fighter plane that apparently joined the battle. The spokesman gave no exact time for the shooting down of the F-14. No American casualties were reported. The incident was the first such hostility between the two nations since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> destroyed two oil platforms in April. `` Our reports indicate that two small Iranian patrol boats were sunk and one was damaged. The <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> also reported that it downed an Iranian F-14 aircraft that was approaching in a hostile manner,'' the spokesman said. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said the fighter jet was approaching the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> `` at a high rate of speed'' in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> and that `` warnings were issued.'' `` It was clearly identified as an F-14; it ignored warnings and was approaching in a hostile manner,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials had not determined whether the F-14 was in sight at the time it was shot down. He said that after the incident, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces watched an Iranian helicopter search the area where he said the fighter jet was downed and that the American forces were `` standing clear and allowing them to continue their operations.'' <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said seven hours after the airliner went down, `` We are certainly very much in touch with this, but the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is handling everything. At the moment, there is not anything for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to say.''

 Former pop singer <PERSON> Cat </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> told delegates to the weekend annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> that he's glad he got out of the music business. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, now known as <ORGANIZATION> Yousuf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, converted to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> nine years ago after a successful career that included such hits as `` Wild World,'' ` Peace Train,'' `` Morning Has Broken,'' `` Oh Very Young'' and `` Another Saturday Night.''

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, who successfully prosecuted Colombian cocaine kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, traded his clout as a crime-busting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney to mount a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bid as a late-comer with no money, headquarters or paid staff. He faces a party favorite with a 10-month, $ 2 million head start and the endorsement of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In announcing his candidacy last week, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> forced a Sept. 6 <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primary with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, who had had no <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opposition in the race for the seat being vacated by veteran Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, a Democrat. That rankles state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders, who consider <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> a spoiler and an underdog with no chance of winning. They complain he never even sought the blessing of his party. It delights Democrats and <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>'s wife and nine children. `` It's been a long decision,'' said <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>'s 17-year-old son, <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>. `` We all sat around the dinner table and talked. Everyone put in his two cents.'' The 44-year-old prosecutor, who dumped a 17-year career to make his first try for political office, is no stranger to controversy. During his six years as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 32-county <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> battled corrupt public servants, drug lords, attorneys, prominent businessmen and high-profile figures. He took on the governor, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators, a county commission, Panamanian strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and onetime baseball pitching ace <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> McLain </PERSON>. He just finished successfully prosecuting <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, a leader of the violent Colombian <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug smuggling cartel, and he openly criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for considering dropping drug indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if he would leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` I ` ve dealt with the law in all fashions _ drugs, environment, national security, civil rights, labor, veteran issues. Any issue a senator's work touches on I have worked with because I enforced the laws,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure I understand those issues better than <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> does.'' His hard work in the courtroom won him a lot of attention _ not always good. Republican Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s office tried to get him fired after the governor wound up as a witness combating claims that he took illegal campaign contributions while running for mayor of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was never charged with wrongdoing. Newspapers campaigned for <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>'s ouster. Defense attorneys decried what they called abusive, terrorizing, overzealous, bullying prosecutorial tactics. They compared it to McCarthyism and called for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigations, which always cleared <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> of any inappropriate behavior. Supporters who know him well say he is a masterful litigator with an uncanny street sense, and he has earned an outstanding reputation throughout the criminal justice system. `` He's always given 100 percent to everything,'' says his wife, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, who has been sharing duties as scheduling secretary with their older children. `` We're all pitching in,'' said <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>, who enlisted three high school buddies to help carry campaign posters. `` We're all making some sacrifices, but no one minds.'' `` How many 17-year-olds get to be campaign manager _ at least for the first few days when I was the only one around,'' <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> has $ 30,000 from his government pension fund for his campaign and his classic 1968 Mustang for travel. `` He does n't have one iota of a chance,'' said L.E. `` <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state chairman and head of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s steering committee in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jeanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, GOP state chairman, said she did n't know <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> was running until she read about it. `` I think he should have contacted the party out of courtesy,'' she said. There was no comment from <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. `` He is vacationing with his wife,'' said press aide <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kincaid </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, came to <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>'s defense. `` I think they're wrong. He's going to have the power of the people behind him,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> could n't enter the race earlier because he had an obligation to his job.'' Democrats, locked in a four-way primary battle, are thrilled with <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>'s entry. `` It's a brand new ballgame for the Republicans,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, state Democratic chairman. `` The number one issue with people today is crime and drugs, and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> has been in the forefront of that battle prosecuting people. `` I do n't think he is a fool. If he did n't have some indication he had a chance, he would n't have gotten into the race.''

<HEAD>Massachusetts Towns Resist New Area Code</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fearing a loss of identity, not to mention overworked index fingers, a number of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> towns are waging a last-ditch battle against their banishment from the 617 area code. Those digits have become synonymous with high technology, urban sophistication and progressive politics, town officials say, while the new 508 area code is strictly for hicks. On July 16, approximately 190 communities in central and eastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> are slated to switch from 617 into 508. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says that the new area code is unavoidable. `` Quite literally, we're running out of phone numbers,'' said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvestri </PERSON>. The state's economic boom, in addition to launching Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> toward the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, has pushed up demand for new telephone connections, particularly in the corridor of high technology firms along Route 128 around <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Part of the problem was caused by the growing number of telephone lines needed by computers, said spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchand </PERSON>. Without the new area code, <PERSON> Silvestri </PERSON> said, the phone company would have to set up a waiting list for new numbers sometime early next year. `` By adding 508, we'll double the number of numbers available _ essentially overnight,'' she said. In <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, a wealthy bedroom community 15 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, residents object to being lumped with rural communities and small cities in central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Dover's appeal to remain in 617 was turned down. `` We are intimately a part of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area, and they're casting us off as total exurbia,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, a mutual fund investment manager who lives in <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> and works in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> `` We are being put in with <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> and other communities we have nothing to do with.'' The new boundary of 617 is a rough semicircle around <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Marblehead </LOCATION> on the north shore to <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> to the south. Since announcing the switchover two years ago, the telephone company has been assuring the public that it will not hike its fees as a result of the change. When the first map of the 508 district came out, 25 cities and towns objected to their inclusion in it. Six of them eventually won their return from area code exile. Two others, North Reading and <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, are still waiting for rulings from the state's <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, but without much optimism. `` We understand the reasons why they're doing it, and we realize it probably has to be done,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>'s board of selectmen. `` But we'd prefer to stay in 617, and we just wanted to throw in our request _ even though we realize it's probably a futile shot.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said businesses object because of the cost of changing their stationery and brochures, while residents are unhappy about having to dial an extra four digits _ 1 and 617 _ every time they call <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> officials also raised some frightening scenarios, like residents dialing a Boston-area hospital but forgetting about the new area code and panicking when they doe n't get through. `` There's going to be a lot of confusion,'' said the town's assistant manager, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> `` Most of the hospitals that <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> residents use are in the 617 area, and that could be a problem in an emergency.'' Following the advice of telephone companies in other states that have made similar switches, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> has launched a direct-mail and advertising campaign to educate the public about the change. In addition, the company said it will provide a three-month grace period in which calls to the wrong area code will still go through. Then, for approximately a year, people who use the wrong area code will get a recorded message telling them to re-dial using the correct code. When <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> separated three of its boroughs _ <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> _ into the 718 area code in 1985, a similar public education campaign and a grace period worked well, according to <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gimas </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has n't always been so resistant to change After all, the telephone was invented in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and it was during a measles outbreak in 1879 in northern <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> that a major innovation in phone service was made. Until then, telephone operators memorized each customer's name and position on a switchboard. Fearing operators might fall ill, physician <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> hit on the idea of assigning each customer a number.

<TEXT>
 Though <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON> has never felt the sweet rhythm of casting a fly rod or the glowing satisfaction of tying a fly, he has been hooked by a passion for the work of the world's greatest fly tiers. `` It's the artistry, the craft and the skills these men possess,'' said <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON>, a master picture framer who also frames flies for display. <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON>'s been a fly admirer for a long time, but what got his collection rolling was the demise of the venerable <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> angling supplier Wm. Mills & amp; Son. `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> -LRB- who was liquidating the company's assets -RRB- opened the doors for me,'' <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON> recalled. `` We all knew that somewhere in that place were the flies of <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, the father of American fly fishing. I kept buying all morning long. `` He suggested he would like to have a set of flies -LRB- framed -RRB- for himself. Once I agreed to that, the whole picture changed. He took me down to the basement and showed me flies that were tied in 1870. `` I wound up with an inventory of 100,000 flies.'' The flies are put together with bits of fur, feathers and anything else that a tier thinks might attract a fish, all tied to a small hook. Most are designed to imitate flies that trout and salmon feed on along streams and are less than half an inch long. <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON> shows them off with a flair so compelling that other collectors frequently offer to share their most prized flies with him if he will frame a set for them. `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> was here from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Umpqua </LOCATION>,'' a famed steelhead river in southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON> said. `` He says, ` Have you heard of <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>?' I said, ` You have a set of <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>?' He said he had 38 of them. He said, ` I'll split them down the middle with you.' <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON> uses a water-soluble glue _ so they can be removed without harm _ to mount the flies on a tiny clear plastic post within the frame. `` When I first thought of it, I was sitting in the subway, and all of a sudden, I could see in my mind the man casting and the fly floating in space,'' said <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON>, a former denizen of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` That got to me. So I raised it from its background, which gives it its whole dimension.'' <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON> combines flies with a painting, print, carving, photograph or some other work of art, taking special care that they relate to each other. `` Given the fact that I did not fish or tie flies, I had to make this interesting for myself,'' <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON> said. An etching by English artist <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> showing a single salmon leaping from a river has been combined with four feather-wing salmon flies tied by Spanish master <PERSON> Belarmino </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. Other fly tiers represented include <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, inventor of the gray ghost streamer; <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wulff </PERSON>, originator of the royal <PERSON> Wulff </PERSON> dry fly, and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Prey </PERSON>, creator of the Thor steelhead pattern. A photo of famed <LOCATION> Pensylvania </LOCATION> angler <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leisenring </PERSON> is mounted with a set of 11 trout flies and the dog-eared piece of paper on which he stored them, complete with pencil notations about the flies. <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON>'s work has been displayed at the American Museum of Sports and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A collection of 230 pieces is been at the American Museum of Fly Fishing in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, Vt. The Fly Fishing Museum and <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON>'s workshop now occupy the top floor of his small two-story house. Now 75, <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON> figures he has another 10 years to build up the collection and hopes to see the work continued by his son-in-law, who lives nearby with <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON>'s daughter and two grandchildren Visitors to the museum are few, so far _ it opened in May _ and not all of them understand what he is doing. `` I had a man in here the other day who said he loved fishing so much, you could put a bucket of water in front of him and he could fish all day,'' said <PERSON> Cushner </PERSON>. `` Yet with all this around him, he was n't interested. Fascinating.''

 <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, plans to join his buddies in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on July Fourth, but he might not be able to make the trip again. The government is trying to deport him. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, an immigrant from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> who volunteered for a hitch in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> even though he was n't a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, knows the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has a strong case. He's had 21 felony convictions and spent six years in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prison for armed robbery since he left the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1970. But the 39-year-old <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> believes his troubles can be traced to post-traumatic stress disorder, and he hopes an immigration judge takes that into consideration at his July 21 deportation hearing. He said the disorder, which has been found in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and victims of violent crimes, led him to heavy drug and alcohol abuse to escape flashbacks of terrifying ambushes and firefights from his nine months in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, wearing his Silver and Bronze stars and two Purple Hearts, staged a small demonstration with family and friends outside the federal building here Friday before heading for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to join other veterans at the Vietnam War memorial. He insists he's not bitter and would enlist again, though some of his friends said he is getting a raw deal. `` There was a war going on and I thought I had an obligation to defend the country I was living in,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a slight man with a wispy moustache and a rash of blue tattoos on both arms who speaks with a hint of an accent. `` I love this country,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I'd go back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> again in a heartbeat. I'd do it all again.''. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, his wife, their baby and her young son live in a tough housing project in <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION> on $ 628-a-month disability payments from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. He will soon begin treatment at a post-traumatic stress unit at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> enlisted when he was 18 in 1967, two years after his family emigrated to <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION>, an industrial city about 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>. He was shipped off to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in January 1968 as an infantryman with the 1st Air Cavalry Division. In May 1968, he said, he was wounded when his squad was ambushed. He recovered and was sent back into action, and was wounded again with shrapnel. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he still ca n't get the episodes out of his mind. `` I seclude myself, I sort of live in my own prison,'' he said. `` I'm up and down looking out the windows all the time. My wife tells me I check the perimeter all night.'' After nine months in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was sent to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benning </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. He said he started drinking heavily and used marijuana, barbituates and heroin `` anything that would make me pass out so I would n't have to face the flashbacks.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> gave him a bad-conduct discharge, later upgraded to an honorable discharge. He did time in county jails in five or six states for drug-related offenses and petty crimes before he held up a store in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1979. When he got out of prison in 1985, the government renewed earlier efforts to deport him. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, officer-in-charge of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, said resident aliens who have been convicted of two crimes involving `` moral turpitude'' are subject to deportation, but would not comment on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s case. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Money </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s legal representative, said he believes there is a good chance <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will be allowed to stay, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s supporters said he deserves amnesty `` Here's a man that volunteered to serve that did n't have to,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran and neighbor. `` He was willing to give up his life for his country. Why should he all of a sudden be kicked out?''

 Blues singer and alto saxophone player <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> `` Cleanhead'' <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON>, known for his coarse, swinging instrumental style balanced by mellifluous vocals, has died. He was 70. <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON>, who had been suffering from cancer of the esophagus, entered the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in mid-June for treatment. He was stricken by a heart attack Saturday, hospital officials and family members said. <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON>, who sang with the <ORGANIZATION> Cootie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> in the 1940s, was best known for such songs as `` Cherry Red,'' `` Kidney Stew Blues,'' and `` Somebody's Got To Go.'' He got his nickname for his bald head, which he often joked about in the lyrics of his songs, including `` Cleanhead Blues.'' <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> was born Dec. 18, 1917 in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tex </PERSON>.; his parents were musicians. He toured through the South and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> with bands fronted by <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> from the mid - to late 1930s, and in 1940 toured with blues legend <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Broonzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1942, joined the <ORGANIZATION> Cootie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> and recorded `` Cherry Red.'' Jazz critic <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Feather </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> `` established himself as a powerful blues singer with a personal, broken-toned style.'' After serving in the Army near the end of World War II, <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> formed his own 16-piece orchestra and appeared with the Ink Spots. But he ended up returning to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in 1954 to teach music. Rediscovered by band leader <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Otis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> more than 20 years ago and revived his career with club engagements and new albums, including `` Kidney Stew is Fine,'' `` Cleanhead's Back in Town'' and `` You Ca n't Make Love Alone.''

 Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets Sunday to disperse hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians enraged by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> archaeological dig near one of Islam's holiest sites. White clouds of tear gas hung over the biblical Via <LOCATION> Dolorosa </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as the two-hour battle raged. At least 15 Palestinians were injured, including eight by tear gas, five by beatings and two by rubber bullets, said officials at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Several police officers were hit by rocks, police officials said. Police said seven Arabs were arrested, and authorities later closed most schools in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The protests began after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> launched a dig Sunday to clear an ancient underground staircase near the Temple Mount, a site sacred to both Moslems and Jews. The Temple Mount, known in Arabic as <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, or Noble Enclosure, houses the Dome of the Rock and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosques. A crowd gathered and Moslem religious leaders, using loudspeakers, called on Arabs to defend the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, saying they feared the Israelis would dig a passage to the mosques. Government officials said the dig would not violate Moslem religious property. Massive police reinforcements were rushed to the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and police blocked gates and streets leading to it. Dozens of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> youths, some of them masked, dashed from behind street corners to throw rocks. Police chased the crowd, firing rubber bullets and tear gas. An Arab girl about 6 years old was seen with her flower-print dress covered with blood. Witnesses said she was hit with a rubber bullet. The riot was one of the most widespread and violent in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> since the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories started Dec. 8. At least 215 Palestinians and four Israelis have died in the uprising. Most of the occupied territories were quiet Sunday, but a firebomb set ablaze an army vehicle in downtown <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. It was quickly extinguished and soldiers put the area under curfew. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, government archeologist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahat </PERSON> said the dig was intended to open a stairway and clean up part of a more than 2,000-year-old tunnel bordering the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>. The Temple Mount is also bordered by the Western Wall, the last remnant of the Second Temple and Judaism's holiest site. <PERSON> Bahat </PERSON> said the 70-yard-long tunnel links the wall with the <LOCATION> Via </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dolorosa </LOCATION>, which according to Christian tradition was the route <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> took to the cross. According to <PERSON> Bahat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports, the call broadcast from the mosque claimed that `` the Jews planned to dig a tunnel'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kkatib </PERSON>, deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> which administers the sites, said Moslem religious officials were aware of plans for the dig but opposed it. <PERSON> Bahat </PERSON> said the dig was started in coordination with the Moslem authorities, but <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mintzer </PERSON>, spokesman for Religious Affairs Ministry, said Moslem officials were not notified the work would start Sunday. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s adviser on Arab affairs, <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheshin </PERSON>, said it was a mistake to start the dig `` without making a pre-arrangement with Moslem authorities.'' Moslem and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials decided later Sunday to hold further talks about the excavation and cover up the dig for the time being. Moslems said they want the hole to remain closed. <PERSON> Zevulun </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlev </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said he hoped the tunnel eventually could be opened as a tourist attraction.

 <LOCATION> GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A West German army helicopter flying in heavy fog slammed into a cliff and crashed in the <LOCATION> Bavarian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION> on Sunday, killing at least seven people, officials said. Five civilians, three army crewmen and a soldier were on board the helicopter when it went down near the resort of <LOCATION> Garmisch-Partenkirchen </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> said. Witnesses reported that the Bell UH-1-D helicopter struck a cliff at about 11 a.m., exploded, and plummeted 400 yards into an isolated area. The crash site is near the 9,775-foot Zugspitze, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s highest peak. Seven bodies were recovered by Sunday night, police said. They said the body of a dog was also found at the crash site. The search was called off until Monday morning because of thick fog in the mountainous region, according to an army spokesman in <LOCATION> Mittenwald </LOCATION>, about 12 miles east of <LOCATION> Garmisch-Partenkirchen </LOCATION>. When asked about the possibility of survivors, the spokesman said: `` We have to assume the worst.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity. The helicopter took off from army barracks in <LOCATION> Mittenwald </LOCATION> at about 10 a.m., the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. It picked up the five civilians and a soldier at a support base for troops undergoing mountain training, the ministry said. Rescue workers were planning to stay in shelters overnight and resume their search in the morning, police said. Sunday's crash was the third involving West German military flights in as many days. On Saturday, a West German Transall C-160 transport plane crash landed near <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, injuring all six soldiers aboard. A day earlier, a small reconnaissance airplane crashed during army exercises in the northern West German state of <LOCATION> Schleswig-Holstein </LOCATION>, killing the pilot.

 A record store that sold fortune cookies containing miniature condoms as a joke failed to draw a laugh from officials in charge of the city's largest summer festival. Mainstream Records began selling the condom cookies at Summerfest when the lakefront festival opened Thursday. But <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Mainstream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, said Summerfest officials asked him to stop selling the items. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said he was told the condom cookies were inappropriate for an event that is billed as a family festival. <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, executive director of Summerfest, was not aware the cookies were being sold on the Summerfest grounds until a reporter told her Friday evening. `` We will be taking care of that,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. `` That is not cool.'' A short time later, the cookies disappeared from Mainstream's stands Before the cookies were withdrawn, workers at the stand estimated they had sold 50. Each $ 1.99 cookie was sealed individually in plastic. Upon breaking it, a purchaser found an appropriate fortune wrapped around a miniature condom. <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, bought two cookies as a practical joke for her brother and boyfriend. `` They'll die,'' she said. `` They'll be embarrassed.'' <PERSON> Deedee </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 22, a worker at the Mainstream stand, said many were embarrassed but also curious. `` A lot of them wanted to know if they really work,'' she said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, outgunned by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, has to scrounge around the world for its military hardware because of a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> arms embargo and Western military analysts say it is short of aircraft, tanks and artillery. But when the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> broke out in September 1980, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s armed forces were the best-equipped in the oil-rich <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region Its air force, for instance, had 77 U.S.-built F-14 Tomcats, the only military force outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to have the advanced interceptors. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said crewmen aboard the guided missile cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> believed they were being attacked Sunday by an Iranian F-14 when they downed an Iranian passenger jetliner in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said all 290 people aboard the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Air jetliner were killed. At the outset of the Iran-Iraq war, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also had 190 F-4 Phantoms, 166 F-5 <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> and 205 U.S.-built helicopter gunships. They were purchased by pro-Western <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, who was ousted in the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Now, after nearly eight years of war and a chronic lack of spare parts, military analysts estimate <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has 60 to 80 F-4s and F-5s and less than 10 operational F-14s. By comparison, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has more than 500 combat aircraft supplied by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, along with advanced missiles and laser-guided bombs. However, reliable sources have reported the Iranians have recently obtained some spares for the F-14 and avionics for their F-5s. It is not clear to what extent this has helped their forces. Hard-pressed to get its hands on spares for its U.S.-built weapons, the <LOCATION> Iranians </LOCATION> have in recent years turned to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for hardware. Despite <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s denials that it supplies <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with weapons, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is now <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s main arms supplier, usually through <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. But the Iranians are outgunned on the ground by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the gulf. In the two major naval clashes in the gulf, April 18 and Sunday, the Iranians have lost eight craft sunk or damaged. But despite the Americans' vastly superior firepower, the Iranians are still considered a threat at sea. They have several British or U.S.-built destroyers and frigates, although some are believed to be non-operational, and 6-10 French-made Kama-class missiles boats.

<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 8th graf bgng, `The suspect,' to CORRECT time of warning
to 10:49 a.m. sted of 10:19 a.m.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Following is the text of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> briefing conducted by Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, at the Pentagon on Sunday: Good afternoon. After receiving further data and evaluating information available from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, we believe that the Cruiser USS Vincennes, while actively engaged with threatening Iranian surface units and protecting itself from what was concluded to be a hostile aircraft, shot down an Iranian airliner over the Straits of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government deeply regrets this incident. A full investigation will be conducted, but it is our judgement that based on the information currently available, the local commanders have sufficient reasons to believe their units were in jeopardy and they fired in self defense. The sequence of events commenced when the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> helicopter was fired upon by Iranian surface units at 10:10 a.m., local Gulf time. For a correlation, that was 2:10 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, approximately 40 minutes before the air action. Subsequently, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> identified the Iranian firing units and closed to engage. The Iranian gunboats turned toward <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> at high speed and were engaged at 10:42 a.m. with gunfire from the cruiser and the Frigate <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>. While so involved, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> detected an aircraft over <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at about 10:47 a.m., again, local time. This aircraft headed toward the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and commenced closing at high speed. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> immediately began assessing this new threat. The suspect aircraft was outside the prescribed commercial air corridor. More importantly, the aircraft headed directly for -LRB- the -RRB- <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> on a constant bearing at high speed, approximately 450 knots. A warning was sent on both military and civilian distress frequencies beginning at 10:49 a.m. This procedure was repeated several times, but the aircraft neither answered nor changed its course. There were electronic indications on -LRB- the -RRB- <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> that led it to believe that the aircraft was an F-14. There have been a number of F-14 flights in the area over the last few days. Given the threatening flight profile and the decreasing range, the aircraft was declared hostile at 10:51 a.m. local. At 10:54 a.m., when the aircraft was about nine miles away, -LRB- the -RRB- <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> fired two standard surface-to-air missiles, at least one of which hit at an approximate range of six miles. Due to the limited visibility, the aircraft was not visually sighted until the missile impacted. In understanding this incident, it is important to appreciate the total context in which our ships operate. The <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> government emphasized from the outset that committing military units to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> mission would involve risks and uncertainties. This conclusion has been reinforced by several incidents. For example, the <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> mining, the Stark tragedy and the <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> mining. A decision was made early in the commitment to give our commanders sufficient latitude to protect their people and equipment when hostile intent was manifested. They do not have to be shot at before responding. Throughout our involvement in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, the Iranian government has repeatedly threatened and fired upon <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. In September 1987, as a result of the attack on the USS Stark, and other incidents, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> issued a Notice to Airmen, locally known as a NOTAM, which advised all aircraft in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships were taking additional precautions, and of the need to identify themselves and to state their intentions. Additionally, they were advised that failure to respond to requests for identification and intentions or to warnings and operating in a threatening manner could place the aircraft at risk by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defensive measures. As to the recent environment, we have alerted our forces to indications that Iranian units might attempt to carry out attacks against our forces over the July 4th holiday period. We are still in the process of reconciling and collating all the data. An official investigation of the incident will be conducted by Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, of the <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Central Command. That concludes my statement. MORE

<HEAD>WASHN: my statement.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Q: Admiral, has there been contact with the Iranian government, and if not, is any planned? A: There has not been direct contact, no. I think we will be awaiting the results of the <ORGANIZATION> SAR </ORGANIZATION> effort and any other indications. Q: Have any orders been issued to change the mode of our operations in the gulf? A: No. Q: Admiral, the Aegis cruiser is supposed to be one of the most sophisticated in the fleet in determining threat. How is it that it apparently misidentified this aircraft? A: I'm a little confused by your statement. It is one of the most sophisticated ships we have and certainly the improvements made in Aegis weapon system have greatly amplified our capability, and I'm talking about the number of targets that we can track, the ranges that we can detect a target, the altitudes, and our ability to detect and classify emanations from an aircraft. But it has not solved all of our problems, and it does not defy the laws of physics. And one of the most difficult problems is from a radar blip, particularly from a head on target, to identify the type of aircraft and so forth. I repeat for you, that the people in the command center, and the people operating the radar had about four minutes from the time they picked this target up until it was declared hostile. That alone is a severe constraint. Q: But what lead them to believe that it was an F-14 echo? A: Some other electronic information, which is classified, and I'm not willing to discuss. Q: Was the airliner squawking, as it should be, with its IFF? Two, did the airliner have the right to be where it was? And what was your judgment? Was the skipper acting under the rules of engagement or was he a little bit impetuous here? A: Let me do it in reverse order if I could, please. It is my judgment on the information that is available to us, that the commanding officer conducted himself with circumspection. And considering the information that was available to him, followed his authorities and acted with good judgment in a very trying period of time and under very trying circumstances. Let me repeat that not only was he following this aircraft, and was he concerned about it, he was engaged on the surface with Iranian units at the time. The aircraft was not in the the air corridor that it would normally be in, but the air corridor has a limited amount of air space, and he was outside of that. Whether that is a factor, I do n't know at this point. And what was your first one? Q: The last one was whether his <ORGANIZATION> IFF </ORGANIZATION> was squawking, and whether it would have happened if the old rules of engagement were still in force? A: The old rules of engagement? Q: If we had n't changed the rules in September, would he have held his fire _ the skipper? A: Certainly, the rules of engagement would not have been as specific in the authorities it granted him. I do n't know whether he would have or not, under the old rules. You're asking me about <ORGANIZATION> IFF </ORGANIZATION>. We did have some electronic emanations, but I really ca n't say any more than that. Q: But do you ... he did n't identify himself as a commercial or _ A: No, he did not. Q: How come? Did he _ A: Now, I should stress, of course, in that regard, that we warned him on the Civialian Air Distress Net three times in these few minutes, and four times on the Military Air Distress Net. Q: _ saying, `` We have you'' _ A: Yes. We received no answers. Nor did he vary course, or he did he indicate in his conduct in any way that he had received our communications. Q: He was squawking something, but not the recognizable `` I am an airliner?'' A: Well, it led us to believe that it was a military aircraft.

 If anybody is happy about the devastating drought that is parching the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, it has got to be <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> `` Skip'' Stewart-Abernathy and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Masler </PERSON>. Stewart-Abernathy is the historical archaeologist for the state of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. For the past few days he's been having the time of his life, delving into steamboat wrecks left high and dry by the receding river. `` I'm trying to keep this in perspective,'' <PERSON> Stewart-Abernathy </PERSON> admitted during a weekend interview. `` If all the farmers in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> go broke because of this drought, it's a major, major disaster, but for an archaeologist it's a delight for several reasons.'' One of the them is the chance to see century-old steamboats up close. `` We usually only get to see a little piece of these boats, and then through a filter of dark river water,'' said <PERSON> Stewart-Abernathy </PERSON>, who has been scrutinizing two wrecked steamboats and an old wooden barge on the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> side of the river, just below <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. `` They are contained in an area about the size of two city blocks,'' he said. `` One of the boats is really large, about 140 feet long and 30 feet wide. We have n't identified it yet, but we probably will.'' <PERSON> Masler </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, has also been haunting the newly exposed river banks and the sandbar islands which have appeared as the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> dropped more than 20 feet below normal during the drought. <PERSON> Masler </PERSON> has been busy photographing the river, documenting what he believes is an event of historical importance. `` It's an exciting time,'' he said. `` In addition to the old wrecks, some recent wrecks also have been found, including a large, three-deck diesel towboat. It sank in more than 20 feet of water and now it's totally exposed.'' Many people, he said, have been scouring the river banks for relics such as old bottles, square nails and boiler bricks from steamboats. `` I'm not collecting, though,'' he added. `` I'm just documenting. As far as collecting goes, this situation is of much more value to the archaeologists.'' <PERSON> Stewart-Abernathy </PERSON>, who works for the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>, said several excavation teams would be working on the wrecks while the water is low. `` We'll be taking measurements and noting construction techniques, and so forth. You must remember, there were no blueprints for these old boats. The people who constructed them knew what they were doing and they simply built them,'' he said. <PERSON> Stewart-Abernathy </PERSON> said it wo n't be possible to remove the wrecked boats, which have been attracting hordes of sightseers. `` The wrecks are far too large and weigh far too much to be removed from the sites,'' he said. `` But the fact that they are uncovered at this time provides us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Really, it's thrilling to be able to examine these neat old boats and show them off to the public. It's an archaeologist's dream come true.''

<TEXT>
 Q: Was this an accident waiting to happen? A: You could in a sense, of course, characterize all combat operations as an accident waiting to happen. We have said from the very outset of our involvment there that when you're using force, when you're putting combat operations on to support your policy, and it is a policy that is resisted and not agreed to by another party, who is likewise willing to do things, you're running risks. We've never pretended otherwise. We have been very successful with our _ using our strength to keep down these kinds of accidents and incidents. I think that if _ we have contacted airliners before. We have had them respond. They have varied course. That policy has been very successful and again, I repeat, if a country is going to wage combat operations in a certain area and then send a commercial airline in the area during that, of course it's an accident waiting to happen. And if airliners do not pay attention to these instructions and guidance that we have put out, and the warnings we put out, then that poses a problem. We do deeply regret the loss of life though. Q: Admiral, would you imply that not only was this out of the air corridor, and not responding to your signals, but that you detected that it was losing altitude and gaining speed, and flying over an area where combat activity was occurring. In addition to all those irregularities concerning this aircraft, have you been able to determine whether it took off on schedule as a normal commercial flight or are there any other irregularities? A: We're trying to detect that _ or determine that right now. I would like to emphasize your point for a moment. F-14, on corridors, out of corridors _ the important points here are the commanding officer has a responsibility to protect his people, his unit. He is engaged already in a surface action. He has a minimum amount of time. It is logical to conclude that while he is firing, and they are approaching him, and an aircraft lifts off from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, goes toward him, steady course, high speed, decreasing altitude, will not vary, will not contact him, it's a more than logical conclusion that he may very well be in jeopardy. Q: Admiral, on the origination of the flight. Did it come from _ I do n't know what city. I missed that. A: We believe <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>. Q: It did _ that's a military base, is n't it? A: No, it's joint _ civil and military. Q: Just let me finish with that. You tracked that plane on takeoff? A: We do n't know, but maybe we did. Q: Is the first time an Iranian commercial airliner has acted in this way? A: I do n't have a specific example of where it has before. We have multi-nation airliners in the Gulf. In general, our policy has been respected, responded to. Occasionally we have an airliner that ignores it. But usually they are at very high altitude. The reason that these accidents are avoided mainly is that civilian airliners fly at very high altitudes, and particularly because of that area. This one did not. Q: Admiral, the ship captain's responsibility notwithstanding, an F-14 being an American-made plane, should n't it be one of the easier aircraft to identify, especially stacking its information radiated against a four-engine commercial airliner? A: It depends on, of course, what it does. And it depends on how much information you have on it. It depends on the attitude which it's flying. It depends on the altitude. It depends on the atmospheric conditions. It depends on how much time you've got to process the data. And unfortunately, this has been the _ one of the major difficulties in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> from the outset. We're fighting in a lake And when flights come, feet wet, out of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, very few seconds _ no matter what. Q: Admiral, are n't comparisons going to made with _ this was the case of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mistaken identity and a commercial airliner was shot down. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was a case of mistaken identity in Korean OO7. What is the difference, in your view, between this shoot down and that one? A: I think there are two very fundamental differences. There are probably a whole host of them, with more thought. But the fundamental differences are, of course, that it was not war zone, there was not combat in progress, there was not combat there normally; and, secondly, the <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> 007 was not warned in any way, form, or fashion. Nor was, as far as I can tell or determine, was any attempt made to _ to warn. It was a very high altitude, and even after the completion of the incident, I do n't think any claim was made that it was there to bomb or destroy. It was accused of being an intelligence gatherer. That was certainly not the case. Q: Admiral, Thank you very much Admiral <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Sunday proclaimed <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Philippine </PERSON> <PERSON> Duchesne </PERSON>, a French-born nun who worked among the American Indians and founded the American branch of the Society of the Sacred Heart, a saint of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. During a solemn ceremony in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basilica </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> added the 19th century missionary to the list of those Catholics who by virtue of their life and actions the church recognizes as being in heaven, and worthy of honor by the faithful. The 2 -LCB- - hour ceremony also included the canonization of a member of the Trinitarian order, the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> priest <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> Born in 1552, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> devoted his life to work among the poor and to promoting devotion to the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, as well as being confessor to the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> royal family. He died in 1624. <PERSON> Philippine </PERSON> <PERSON> Duchesne </PERSON> was born in 1769 into a prominent French family and at the age of 35 joined the society of the Sacred Heart, founded in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1800 by St. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barat </PERSON>. The primary purpose of the order was to offer formal education to young women, a revolutionary concept at the time. When she was nearly 50 she became the order's first missionary in the New World and founded schools in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, primarily in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Although she never learned English or abandoned her European ways, her pioneer spirit brought her into contact with the Indians. She spent a year among the Potawatomis in what is now <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> until old age and ill health forced her to retire in the convent in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, where she died in 1852, at the age of 83. In his homily to the 20,000 people gathered in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s for the canonization mass, including over 7,000 in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for the <PERSON> Duchesne </PERSON> canonization, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Philippine </PERSON> <PERSON> Duchesne </PERSON>'s `` missionary courage. He said that her life was a reminder that `` the call to holiness is universal and does not know the boundaries of nation, political system, culture or race.'' Since the days of Philippine <PERSON> Duchesne </PERSON> the order has spread throughout the world, and at present includes 5,500 nuns involved in teaching, spiritual guidance, and pastoral activities in 40 countries. Attending Sunday's ceremony were nuns, students, and alumna from all over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a family of <ORGANIZATION> Potawatami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> as well as groups from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Five members of the <PERSON> Duchesne </PERSON> family also attended. A long applause boomed through the basilica as the pope in Latin proclaimed Philippine a saint, and several people burst into tears. In her opening address to a symposium held by the order on Saturday, the society's superior general <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, offered Philippine as a model for contemporary woman. `` A courageous pioneer woman on the American frontier, strong, unflinching in her determination, <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> has a message for women today who find themselves on frontiers of a new sort.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: More Than 50 Soviet Hijackings In Last 15 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A newspaper disclosed Sunday that the Soviet airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> has experienced more than 50 attempted hijackings in the past 15 years. Only a few of the hijackings had been previously reported in the Soviet media. The article by the labor daily Trud was believed to be the most complete report on air piracy in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to date. Trud quoted Deputy Aviation Minister <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON> as suggesting the more than 50 attempts on the state-run airline could have been caused by strict regulations limiting emigration. In Western and developing countries, he was quoted as saying, hijackers basically were trying to `` solve their personal, criminal or political problems.'' In contrast, statistics showed most Soviet hijackers to be `` antisocial and criminal elements who are trying to escape responsibility abroad,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying. Before Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or increased openness on some issues, state-run media and officials often maintained that terrorism was exclusively a Western problem. That position has now changed. In March, the media reported extensively on the attempt by an 11-member Siberian family of jazz musicians, the Ovechkins, to hijack a jetliner bound for <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION>. Five of the hijackers, three passengers and a stewardess were killed in the attempt. Airports are using tougher security measures, but <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON> was quoted as saying they do not guarantee safety from hijackings. `` Life shows that hijack attempts are still being made, that there are people who are ready for terrorist acts. Practice shows that security systems do n't always and everywhere work without fail,'' he was quoted as saying.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was saddened Sunday that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had accidentally shot an Iranian airliner out of the sky, but said he would not cut short his July Fourth holiday weekend. `` We do n't expect him to come back early,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whose statement was relayed by <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, called the accident `` a terrible human tragedy.'' `` I am saddened to report that it appears that in a proper defensive action by the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> this morning in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, an Iranian airliner was shot down over the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Our sympathy and condolences go out to the passengers, crew, and their families. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will conduct a full investigation,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` We deeply regret any loss of life.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> defended the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action, saying the civilian aircraft had `` headed directly'' for the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> while it was engaged in fighting with five Iranian boats. `` The only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> is peace and this tragedy reinforces the need to achieve that goal with all possible speed,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president and his top aides conferred by telephone and telex throughout the early morning Sunday, with their discussions culminating in a 1:05 p.m. EDT conference call with top officials, a briefing by the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, and the release of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement at the White House. But the White House retained its quiet weekend atmosphere. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> did not meet with reporters, and an aide said no briefings were planned until Tuesday. The president and first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flew by helicopter to the Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, retreat in the <LOCATION> Catoctin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday. They planned to hold to their schedule, which was to return to the White House at midday on Monday and view the evening Fourth of July fireworks from the balcony of the residence, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. White House deputy press secretary <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, who met with reporters briefly, said that national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> awoke <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at 4:52 a.m. EDT with the news that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces believed they had shot down an Iranian F-14 jet fighter. He received another update in writing at 8:11 a.m. that noted the Iranian claim that a civilian jetliner had been downed. At 9:50 a.m., he was told that the Iranian allegations might be correct, the spokesman added. <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> flew back to the White House Sunday morning, breaking off a speaking engagement in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The spokesman said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in time for the conference call with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other top aides at 1:05 p.m., during which the president's written statement was discussed as well as the details of the incident. Also included in the call were Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, White House chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> deputy <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> planned to keep the president updated on the situation with written statements and telephone conversations, <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said.

 The producer of this year's <ORGANIZATION> JVC </ORGANIZATION> Jazz Festival says the 10-day event `` went beyond our expectations'' and he's already looking ahead to next year's program but `` it does get tougher and tougher each year. `` I'm ecstatic about the reviews, which have been totally fair and good,'' said producer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wein </PERSON>. `` They reviewed the music and not the sound system this year. We seem to have solved the sound problem in <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> that really hurt us last year. The festival closed Sunday. `` In a festival of such magnitude where so many things can go wrong, on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being perfect, this year was 8 -LCB- to nine. Last year was a six,'' said <PERSON> Wein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wein </PERSON> feared the concurrent <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> might smother the jazz festival. But, he says, advertising for the arts festival, which announced the jazz concerts, increased gross sales over last year some 8 to 12 percent. `` My problem is what do I do next year,'' <PERSON> Wein </PERSON> says. `` Last night I could n't sleep, trying to think of what I'm going to do next year. `` JVC -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of audio and video products -RRB- is happy as sponsor. We'll be back next year and <ORGANIZATION> JVC </ORGANIZATION> will be back with us. We'll try to come up with a slightly new face next year.'' <PERSON> Wein </PERSON> reviewed some of the festival's events. `` We're really pleased with the ` Love of <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- program which opened the festival,'' <PERSON> Wein </PERSON> says. `` And the fact that <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> -RRB- made an appearance was a highlight. -LRB- <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorter </PERSON> did an exciting event. I thought one of the best things was Miles -LRB- <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> -RRB-, who was better than ever. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> did well. The Latin Jam was a great success.'' <PERSON> Wein </PERSON> said he thought booking singer <PERSON> Miki </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> would be a risk but her concert was almost sold out two days beforehand. `` She's a very good young singer. We're trying with her like we did with <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> _ who became an instant star.''

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said Sunday he would have problems accepting an offer from likely Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to fill the vice presidential spot on the party ticket. The <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Democrat, who is rumored to be under consideration for the No. 2 job, said his relunctance is rooted in the nature of the vice presidency. Every party's presidential nominee offers his running mate an opportunity to be a `` player,'' but `` it never happens that way,'' <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said. Ultimately, the vice president gets lost in the shadows of the president. `` In modern times, it is a dead-end street,'' he said in an interview following a speech to the Governor's School at <ORGANIZATION> Hendrix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> told the crowd of more than 500 he had discussed the vice presidency with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. But he said, `` Speaking of vice president, do n't hold your breath on that.'' He said the vice president is wed to positions taken by the president. `` As <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has learned, the vice presidency gives you none of the pleasure and all of the guilt,'' <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said. `` The vice presidency is much like a ` me, too' position, unless you're going to a funeral,'' he said.

 The selection of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> to deliver the speech nominating <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the Democratic presidential candidate shows the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign is reaching out for <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> support, local political observers said Sunday. `` What I think Gov. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> will be doing is hoping to mold a coalition,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who teaches a politics course at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. `` I think he was selected mainly because he's a Southerner.

However, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said most television viewers `` have already come to grips with who Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is through the long primary season.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A handgun-safety group on Sunday urged parents to take precautions to keep handguns away from their children, especially at this time of year when children are off from school. The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a non-profit group established in 1983 to educate Americans about the risks of handgun ownership, released a study that found that 38 percent of the unintentional shootings of children were either self-inflicted or inflicted by other children. The study, called `` Child's Play: A Study of 266 Unintentional Handgun Shootings,'' also found that an additional 41 percent of the guns used in shootings of children were owned by a friend's parents or by relatives other than the victim's parents The center studied 266 unintentional shootings of children that took place between January 1986 and May 1988. The shootings were either self-inflicted or inflicted by other children age 16 and under. The center said it compiled its data from reports in the news media and, in some cases, follow-up conversations with police departments and hospitals. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, chairman of the center, recommended that parents either remove handguns from their homes or, `` at the very least, keep them unloaded and securely locked up.'' Shields also suggested that parents check with adults at other places where their children play to make sure that loaded guns are not easily accessible. He added that children may be at particular risk of unintentional shooting during the summer because `` children are n't in school and have more free time They'll be spending more time playing at their homes and those of friends and relatives.''

 The government said Sunday that beginning this week it is easing limits on checking account withdrawals, imposed when banks reopened May 9 after a two-month closure. Starting Monday, customers will be able to withdraw 40 percent of the funds in their accounts up to a maximum of $ 20,000, said a communique released by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a government regulatory agency. Since May 9, customers have been permitted to withdraw only 25 percent of their funds, with a maximum of $ 10,000. The government closed 67 of the country's 117 banks March 3 after a run on deposits provoked by a political crisis. Large bank withdrawals began Feb. 26, the day Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the country's de facto ruler, deposed President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> a few hours after the president tried to fire the general. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> freeze on $ 50 million of Panamanian government money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> left the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION>, a commercial and central bank, unable to cover the large withdrawals. The bank closings reduced the economy to a cash-only system and shut down the country's once-thriving international banking center, which had attracted deposits from throughout the world, particularly <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. After weeks of negotiations with private bankers, banks reopened May 9. Restrictions imposed then on withdrawals from savings and fixed-term accounts remain in effect. In addition to the freeze on government funds, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed other economic sanctions and sent additional troops to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and leave the country. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted earlier this year on drug trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

 Delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> called Sunday for curbs on standardized testing of kindergarten children and endorsed their leader's call for radical reforms in running schools. But on the issue of reform, they amended the original resolution proposed by the AFT's Executive Council to add a call for more money to raise teacher salaries and school budgets. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, college professor, argued, `` It's very important to link the reform with adequate funding. If we do n't do that, we'll just be saying a lot of words without any teeth to back it up.'' The 3,000 delegates also called for higher taxes on families earning more than $ 75,000 a year to help close the federal deficit and pay for social programs. They rejected an amendment seeking cuts in Pentagon spending. The delegates heard AFT President <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> open the convention Saturday with a warning that public schools will collapse unless teachers find new and better ways to educate children. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> reiterated his call for experiments in a thousand or more districts where groups of six or more teachers would be given a green light to set up schools within schools, run by teams of teachers without interference from central office bureaucracies. The resolution adopted Sunday said, `` Much that has happened as a result of education reform ... is bad.'' It said `` more and more teachers are being told what to do, when to do it and how _ old-fashioned ` teacher proofing' in the name of reform.'' It said the union will encourage its locals `` to find ways to enable any group of qualified teachers in abuilding to create a different type of public school.'' These experimental schools would be voluntary for both teachers and parents. They would be subject to both union and school board approval. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> suggests team teaching approaches and wider use of technology to free teachers from lecturing and allow students to advance at their own pace. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> associate professor of health sciences, said she was concerned that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> has pushed reforms without adequate support for on-going school programs. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallis </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Patchogue-Medford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said, `` There's no way we can make the kinds of revolutionary and very necessary changes unless additional funding is available.'' On kindergarten testing, the AFT criticized <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s new law requiring children to pass a standardized test to enter first grade. It said such tests `` can, at best, offer only a snapshot representation of a child's skills.'' It said using standardized tests to decide whether a child is ready to enter or exit kindergarten `` can be harmful to young children,'' expecially the disadvantaged. But the delegates accepted an amendment from <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, supporting tests if parents and teachers agree to them and if teachers have the final say on promotion. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said tests can help detect handicaps in young children. On the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobart </PERSON>, an AFT vice president from <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, questioned whether `` we in this room are able to establish exactly what is the level that is necessary for the common defense of this country.'' `` We do not want to indiscriminately cut the defense spending and say it's to go to the schools,'' said <LOCATION> Hobart </LOCATION>. The amendment to cut the military was defeated by voice vote. The 677,000-member AFT, part of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, has traditionally taken a more hawkish stance on the military and foreign affairs than its rival, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The union also voted to seek increases in federal programs to help inner-city school districts. It presented a human rights award to <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, president of the Children's Defense Fund, and announced a drive to alert inner-city parents to the importance of getting their children immunized. The drive is co-sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Drought Effects Felt On Fourth Of July Activities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Residents of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> were asked to pray for rain Sunday to end the drought and a fire was completely contained after charring 1,100 acres of tinder-dry <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> forest and briefly forcing evacuation of 60 families. Some firefighters spent the weekend on standby because of the heightened fire danger caused by the drought, and some <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> communities put off their Fourth of July fireworks displays until later in the summer in hope of rain. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Hare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krishna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devotees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> offered to do its part with what was billed as an emergency rain dance and chanting session. The chants will work because `` the real reason there is no rain is that there is not enough sacrifice to God, so things are being restricted by God,'' said group <ORGANIZATION> Krishna-Katha </ORGANIZATION>. Sunday was declared `` a statewide day of prayer for rain'' in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> by Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` The people of this ... state need to come to their senses and their knees to seek an end to the drought,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' Assistant House Minority Leader <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullen </PERSON> In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, the forest fire mostly within the <ORGANIZATION> Hiawatha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> was contained by fire lines Sunday morning and crew were using hand tools to extinguish lingering embers. Two firefighters had been injured. About 60 families returned early Saturday to their homes along <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Noc </LOCATION> after being evacuated Friday night, a spokeswoman. Two outbuildings were destroyed Friday, she said. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state crews alone have battled at least 438 fires statewide this year, compared with an average 352 fires in each of the previous five years. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> firefighting crews were on standby over the holiday weekend to douse any flames caused by fireworks above tinder-dry fields. Five fires in the <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> area of central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> were started by illegal firecrackers Friday, said <ORGANIZATION> DNR </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, banned fireworks, including the city's own scheduled Fourth of July display. But firefighters were on alert through Monday in the anticipation of blazes started by people using fireworks despite the ban, <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` One-fourth of our manpower have to remain close to the main station'' for the holiday, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Some <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> communities also called off fireworks displays, but rescheduled them for later in the summer in hopes of rain. `` We are having as lot of postponements. You may be seeing shows from now until Halloween,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perri </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Princess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fireworks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. The danger of fireworks and the drought was obvious Saturday to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, who operates a fireworks stand in <LOCATION> Roseland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. He had to put out a grass fire less than 50 yards from his stand when someone threw a lit smoke bomb. The <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has warned hunters that game animals may suffer long-range effects of the prolonged hot, dry weather. `` We do n't want to paint an entirely bleak picture, but people should be prepared to face the harsh reality that some things will be different,'' said Ged Petit, information officer for the state agency. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has already instructed <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> to cut duck hunting bag limits from four ducks to two. And the daily bag limit for squirrels has been reduced from 10 to six. `` I've been in the business 25 years and until the other day I'd never seen a squirrel drinking water in my bird bath,'' <PERSON> Petit </PERSON> said `` That showed me it's bad.''

<HEAD>Government Raises Alcohol Prices For the Second Time This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government announced that alcohol prices will increase an average of 14.7 percent Monday, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. This is the second time the government has raised alcohol prices in the last six months. `` The second increase of official retail prices for spirits this year is caused by the greater growth in personal income than assumed,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> explained in the communique Sunday that announced the increases. A half-quart bottle of regular vodka will cost 1,640 zloty, or $ 3.72. Alcohol prices went up an average of 46 percent February 1 when the government introduced price increases for a wide range of items and services. Price increases are a sensitive issue in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and often provoke protests, but the government says they are needed to keep pace with wage increases. Economists estimate that the current rate of inflation is about 60 percent.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship shot down an Iranian jetliner over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Sunday, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said all 290 people aboard were killed. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said its forces mistook the jet for a warplane. Iranian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> said the incident showed that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> had `` entered a more direct war with our nation,'' and he warned it must face the consequences of `` this criminal act.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jet was hit by two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> missiles minutes after leaving <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. All the passengers were believed killed after the plane `` exploded in the sky'' at an altitude of 7,500 feet, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The report was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Iranian television showed helicopters shooting flares across the crash area and small motor boats moving in to pick up floating corpses. It said 110 had been recovered. A camera zeroed in on a rescue ship. On the ship's deck, a rescue worker held up the corpse of an infant shook his fist. The report said the victims included 66 children. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> declared July 4 a day of mourning. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the shooting occurred during `` proper defensive action'' after the jet headed for the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> as the ship was engaged in a battle with Iranian gunboats in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the entryway to the gulf. He promised a full investigation. `` We deeply regret any loss of life,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said from Camp David. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> warned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` that its latest crime against the Iranian people would only further arouse the abhorrence of -LRB- Iranians -RRB- against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>. The report did not say what actions <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> might take. It said the shooting would strengthen Iranian resolve to continue its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had no immediate comment on the incident. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said `` eyewitnesses on <LOCATION> Hengham </LOCATION> island and Iranian military forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> all clearly saw the passenger plane hit by two surface-to-air missiles fired by the American warships.'' The jet, <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> flight 655, was on a routine 150-mile flight between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s coastal city of <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, across the gulf in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The gulf air corridor is one of the world's busiest, despite the hazards of flying over the waterway where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war for nearly eight years. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the jet left <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> at 10:15 a.m. -LRB- 2:45 a.m. EDT -RRB- and crashed at 10:30 a.m. The casualty toll of 290 would make it the sixth-worst commercial air crash in history. The Pentagon said the gulf skirmish began at 2:10 a.m. when the cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and the frigate <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> encountered Iranian patrol boats in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> had been involved in an encounter with Iranian gunboats Saturday night. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed its naval forces shot down an American helicopter and that two Iranians were missing, in addition to those killed in the air crash. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources in the gulf said an American helicopter was fired upon, but they did not acknowledge <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s claim that it was shot down. Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, emphasized that the American troops `` acted with good judgment.'' He told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> that the American ships fired only after sending warnings to the incoming aircraft. The missile that hit the jet came from the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> crew believed it was firing at an Iranian F-14 fighter jet. `` How could a sophisticated warship like the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> mistake an airliner for a military jet? That's the question that everybody's asking,'' said one military source in the gulf, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The 9,600-ton <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, the first of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s billion-dollar, super-powerful Aegis-type cruisers to be assigned to gulf duty, has been on patrol in the <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> area for the past month. It is equipped with an array of missiles including the SM-2 Standard, a potent, long-range anti-aircraft weapon. The incident underscored the danger faced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the gulf. On May 17, 1987, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate Stark was hit in the gulf by a missile fired by an Iraqi warplane, and 37 crew members died. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the attack was a mistake, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said at that time that such a mistake `` must never be repeated.'' The incident also evoked memories of the Sept. 1, 1983 incident in which a Soviet fighter shot down a South Korean airliner with 269 people aboard after it strayed into Soviet airspace. All aboard were killed. In addition, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> destroyed a <ORGANIZATION> Libyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet over the then-occupied Sinai desert on Feb. 21, 1973, killing 106 of the 113 people on board. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the gulf was recently expanded to allow <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warships to aid tankers of any flag that come under attack and ask for help. It used that new power for the first time late Saturday, when the <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> came to the aid of a Danish supertanker under attack by three Iranian speedboats. The officials said there were no American casualties in Sunday's clash, the second major one between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian forces in the gulf in three months On April 18, American warships and planes, retaliating for the mining of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile frigate, destroyed two Iranian oil rigs and sank or disabled six of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s naval craft, including two of its best frigates.

<HEAD>Couple In Garbage-Filled House Relieved It's Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When authorities discovered the 33,000 pounds of garbage, trash and human waste in her home, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON> said she was `` relieved that the nightmare was over.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON>, her husband, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, and their four children, ages 2 to 14, had retreated to tiny areas of their five-room home when their garbage-packed house and garage in a middle-class neighborhood were uncovered last month. `` I always thought, Well, I'll get to it, I'll get to it,' `` she said. A few years ago, Mrs. <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON> said she began to feel hopeless about ever changing her life. She did less and less housekeeping. `` I guess you kind of get to a point where you give up,'' said <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON>. `` I'm having a hard time understanding how it did happen. But I remember feeling there was n't anything I could do about it. When I went into the house, I just blanked the mess out of my mind.'' Now, the Eggerts are trying to understand how they allowed their lives to run utterly out of control. The couple's four children are living in two foster homes. Mrs. <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON>, 34, has changed her name and taken refuge in a `` safe house'' for abused women. <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON>, 42, has checked himself into the psychiatric unit of a hospital. And their home has been condemned and and boarded up. In the months before the house was discovered, the entire family slept on a single set of bunkbeds. Clean clothes were stored in the closet and stuffed into bureau drawers. A clear path led to the beds through putrid piles of soiled diapers, garbage, and plastic bags of trash. Without running water for the past two years, the Eggerts washed their clothes at a laundromat. They carried home jugs of water from a gas station or nearby brewery. They stood in a plastic baby tub and poured water over themselves to wash. They went to the bathroom in plastic trash bags. `` The kids asked about it at first,'' said <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON>, who was laid off two years ago by the city's parks department. `` They wanted to know why the house was getting dirty. I guess I told them it was going to get better. But it got worse.'' Several times, he said, they attempted cleanups. Once, he called a disposal company but they could n't afford the cost of a trash bin. The Eggerts said they realize their children suffered. `` I hate myself for it,'' <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON> said. `` It kept the kids from doing a lot they should have been able to do.'' `` I know they have got to have anger, not being able to have friends in and having this horrible secret that they kept too,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON> said. The house was discovered when Mrs. <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON> did n't show up at her nursing home job one day and authorities went to the house to check on her. She has started a new job, hoping one day get her children back. `` I'm beginning to take control of my life and it feels good,'' she said. `` But it is hard. I've lost everything I ever had. And I feel like it's me again having to be the responsible one, moving ahead.'' <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON> is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to a charge of domestic assault against his wife and is thinking about entering an intensive, long-term treatment program. `` When this happened, I realized I needed help,'' he said. `` I figured this was the place to come. But until you realize yourself that you need help, you do n't get it. And by the time I did finally realize it, it was too late.''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Sunday appealed to the captors of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European hostages to `` lift the world a step closer to human rights'' by freeing those held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Democratic presidential candidate urged the captors to `` create a breakthrough of better understanding'' and join all the world's people in rebuilding <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which has been ravaged by war. `` One of the tragedies of your long war had been the kidnapping and disappearance of thousand of Lebanese,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in an audio and video message. `` My heart goes out to these victims of war and their families. There are also American and European victims: <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and others are now the prisons of a war that they did not start and can not end. `` But their captivity has reminded us that none of us is free until all of us are free. I appeal to you from the depths of my heart and soul to let them go. Their release could create a breakthrough of better understanding,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s message, which he taped in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, will be distributed to the news media in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign said. No details about the planned distribution of the message were provided by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, which released the text. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest held hostage.

 Bawdy bumper stickers would have to declare their coarser terms in letters only one-eighth of an inch high, under a bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and awaiting Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s signature. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> says he will probably sign the measure into law despite promises of a court fight over its constitutionality. `` It's not the most important bill ever to cross my desk,'' said <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, whose state's depressed, oil-fired economy has been blamed for an accumulated state deficit of $ 1.2 billion since 1982. `` This is an indecency bill,'' said Rep. V.J. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>, who said he introduced the measure after seeing lewd bumper messages once too often. `` I'll worry about whether it's constitutional later.'' <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>'s bill would limit to one-eighth of an inch high and wide the letters used for six specific words describing bodily functions, body parts and sex acts. `` This is not a joke,'' <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>, a Republican, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> when initial debate on his bill drew laughter from his colleagues. `` I am just getting tired of seeing things like this attached to cars. My daughter, my granddaughter has to see this filth.'' Other lawmakers and a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> questioned the constitutionality of the bill, which gained final legislative approval Friday. `` When you start limiting freedom of expression, you are starting problems,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>, a Democrat. `` You do n't need a law like this. We'll be the laughingstock of the nation.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee the legislation would be challenged in court. `` We have a situation of trying to define what obscene is,'' he said. `` In practical terms, it's never been defined.'' Violators could be fined $ 200 for a first offense. A second offense could result in a fine of up to $ 350, while subsequent violations would carry fines of up to $ 500. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said a `` quick review'' of the bill did not show any obvious constitutional problems. `` I will sign it,'' he said. However, the governor said he might change his mind if his staff attorneys decide that `` all the flags are up and it's obviously unconstitutional.'' <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> is not the first state to try to restrict off-color messages on vehicles. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, a law barring bumper stickers containing profane or lewd comments went into effect Friday. Violations can draw fines of up to $ 100. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> enacted a law last year barring obscene bumper stickers from the highways, but a federal court declared it unconstitutional after a truck driver was ticketed. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lawmakers passed a bill that would group obscene bumper stickers into a law that covers other obscene media such as comic books, movies, magazines and records. The <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill earlier this year that outlaws the display of `` obscene or patently offensive'' bumper stickers, signs or other markings on a vehicle. Violators are subject to fines up to $ 50. Earlier in the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> legislative session, <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> said he liked the idea of an outright ban, but questioned whether it would pass court muster. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> said he thinks the size limitation is constitutional. `` That's why I amended it -LRB- the bill -RRB- so many times to get it in the position I wanted it in,'' he said. <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said courts are historically reluctant to allow states the right to restrict expression through prior restraint. `` We're not in favor of corrupting children,'' said <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>. `` But we see it as a dangerous precedent.'' `` I'd be a wealthy man if I had a dollar for every lawmaker who had told me that they agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> position, that a bill is unconstitutional, but they were going to vote for it anyway,'' he said. <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> also said the bill would give a black eye to the state's image. `` The way people are looking at it across the country: ` There goes <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> again,''' he said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have been frigid in the decade since a revolution toppled pro-U.S. <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> and ended what President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had called a `` close, friendly relationship'' between the two countries. The shah's departure from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in January 1979 was followed by the return from exile and rise to power of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 32 million Shiite Moslems, and of the religious opposition. On Nov. 4, 1979, militant Iranian students overran the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> after a three-hour struggle, taking 100 hostages, including 62 Americans. The students demanded extradition of the shah, who was undergoing cancer treatment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, so he could be tried in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as a `` war criminal.'' That idea won swift support from <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who called on the students to act against `` the great satan <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' but <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> refused the extradition request. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> tried throughout his tenure to gain release of the hostages, but 52 of them remained captive for 444 days and did n't win their freedom until Jan. 20, 1981, just hours after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was sworn in to office Officials from the two nations have met since then at conferences held by international organizations and had contact in the <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, where the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal was formed to disentangle the countries' economic ties. But not since 1981 have they had official high-level talks on bilateral issues. However, it was revealed during the Iran-Contra hearings that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had conducted secret talks with the Iranians in 1985 and 1986 and sold them arms in an effort to build better relations and to win the release of hostages from captors in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> over whom <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was believed to have influence. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has barred further arms sales but also has said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be willing to talk with the Iranians to get them to moderate their policies. Tensions with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> flared again in the past year as hostilities increased in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since 1980. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began escorting Kuwaiti tankers flying the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag through the tense gulf in July 1987. On the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> convoy through the gulf, the reflagged <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> tanker <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> hit a mine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of laying the mines that damaged the <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> and the USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> last April. After the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was damaged, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retaliated by destroying two of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Persian Gulf oil platforms. In the ensuing conflict, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces sank or damaged four Iranian attack boats and disabled two frigates. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> responded with attacks on Arab oil facilities and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and Cypriot commercial vessels. On Sunday, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> missile cruiser shot down an Iranian passenger jetliner that it had mistaken for a hostile aircraft. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio called the American destruction of the Iranian jetliner `` new evidence of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> crimes and mischiefs, crimes which expose <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s nature more than ever before.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special envoy said Sunday he has presented concerned parties with a comprehensive plan for peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and had achieved `` general agreement'' to work toward a settlement. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Rafeeuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said he gave a working paper for the plan to <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> for distribution to foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> was scheduled to meet with the <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> ministers before they open their annual meeting Monday. `` The situation has evolved in a direction where there is general agreement among all the parties in reaching a settlement,'' <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said in an interview. He confirmed the document called for an international peacekeeping force and that such forces should monitor cease-fires and withdrawals of troops, but he declined to disclose any further details. He said that in the past few days he also gave copies of the plan to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, and the anti-Vietnamese resistance, a coalition of three guerrilla groups led by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> which includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> defeated a U.S.-backed government in 1975 and, according to some estimates, killed 3 million Cambodians before they were toppled by the Vietnamese invasion of 1978. The intensified search for a political settlement appears to have been sparked by fears from several sides that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> could return to power. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said he will soon distribute the working paper to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and indicated it would be involved in guaranteeing a settlement. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> declined to elaborate on how the different parties reacted to the document, but said: `` They have all indicated their interest and they have asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general to continue his efforts,'' referring to <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. `` All sides would have to make concessions if we are going to reach a solution. ... there has to be give and take,'' he said. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>'s recent meeting in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> was the first time the envoy visted <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. He has been involved in seeking a Cambodian settlement since 1982. The meeting also marked the first formal talks on the issue with the Vietnamese-installed government, which the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> does not recognize. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> flatly rejected the idea of an international peace-keeping force after it was earlier proposed by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> Wednesday, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said it was `` nonsense'' to replace one foreign force, the departing Vietnamese, with another foreign force. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has promised a total withdrawal of its forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by 1990 and has begun a partial pullout of 50,000 troops and withdrawn top military command. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said it will take some time for the different parties to give final reactions to the document. He said it may provide some input for the informal talks scheduled for July 25 in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The Sihanouk-led coalition and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> have already agreed to take part in the talks but there has been no final word from the pro-Hanoi government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The official Cambodian news agency <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> received an invitation but did not say whether the government would attend.

 World chess champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> triumphed in a World Cup tournament Sunday after he outplayed fellow Soviet <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> to win an exciting last-round game. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> finished first with 11.5 points out of a possible 15, a point ahead of fellow Soviet <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> who came in second with 10.5 points. `` In this field which contained the top six players in the world, it was a very, very convincing performance,'' said <PERSON> Bjarke </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristensen </PERSON>, a Danish international master. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, playing white, reached an endgame a pawn ahead. When the 25-year-old titleholder surrounded a second pawn with his 42nd move, <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> resigned. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> won a surprise victory in only 22 moves, when his opponent, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Spassky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, blundered away a bishop. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>'s performance brings the champion closer to surpassing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> as the highest-ranked player in history. `` If I continue to play chess on the same level I think it will happen very soon,'' <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> told a reporter from Spanish National radio. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> scored a remarkable nine victories in the event with four games drawn. But he was defeated by <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> in the 14th round Friday. The tournament was the second in a series of six featuring the leading 24 grandmasters, making up the World Chess Cup with a total prize fund of $ 1.2 million. Each grandmaster will compete in four events. Soviet grandmaster <PERSON> Jaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehlvest </PERSON> finished third with nine points after drawing his game with <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Nogueiras </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Spassky </PERSON> finished tied for fourth with eight points. Also sharing fourth were <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribli </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hubner </PERSON> drew with <PERSON> Ulf </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ribli </PERSON> drew with Soviet grandmaster <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Beliavsky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the third-ranked player in the world, won his last round game against <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusu </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to finish eighth with 7.5 points. British grandmaster <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> drew his game with <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hjartarson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> to come in ninth with seven points. In the last game to finish, <PERSON> Ljubomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ljubojevic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> drew with Dutch grandmaster <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> won the first World Cup tournament in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> in April. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> was not participating. The third World Cup tournament is scheduled for Rekjavik, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, in October. In another development, organizers announced Sunday a chess match between teams representing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the rest of the world to be held next March 19-25 in <LOCATION> Gent </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Illy </PERSON> <PERSON> Iclicki </PERSON>, a Belgian chess master who lives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said the event would consist of four rounds between teams of 10. Each team will have eight men, one woman and one junior. There have been two similar previous clashes, both won narrowly by the Soviets, who have eight players in the world's top 20.

 Ridding Cambodia of the Vietnamese and <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> likely will dominate discussions this week among 15 foreign ministers and other senior officials from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The meetings, which start in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> Monday, come after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> began a partial withdrawal of 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> last week amid fears that a power vacuum in that country could be filled by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. They precede informal talks in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> on July 25 among Cambodian combatants. The informal talks are aimed at finding a political solution to the conflict, which began in 1978 ago when <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s forces invaded that country. The Cambodian problem is likely to be dramatized by the presence at some meetings of Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the charismatic leader of a three-party anti-Vietnamese coalition. The six foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> will hold their 21st annual meeting through Wednesday. It will be followed by sessions between <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> and close supporters from six countries and the European Community. Among those attending the dialogue will be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>; <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s foreign minister; and the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are members of <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION>, which was founded in 1967. The officials are likely to review several recent plans for peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, including ones from the Sihanouk-led coalition, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. All the plans call for the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces, which <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has promised by 1990. Most stress the need for an international peacekeeping force to prevent armed takeover by any one of the warring Cambodian sides. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which imposed a reign of terror on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, form the most powerful group within the <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> coalition and are viewed as superior to the forces of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION>, the pro-Hanoi government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. On Sunday, special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Rafeeuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said he has given the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan to end fighting to all combatants, and each has expressed interest. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said `` there is general agreement'' among <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and the three rebel groups for a settlement. But he declined to give details of his plan. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> were in power in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1975-1978. According to some reports, up to 3 million of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 8 million people died from <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> executions, famine and civil unrest. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other dialogue partners are expected to push strongly for strategies that would deny access to power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> ministers in turn are expected to press the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ the main refugee resettlement countries _ to accept more Indochinese and help stop the recently increased flow of `` boat people'' from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A Kuwaiti panel on Sunday said lax security measures at <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> airport facilitated the April hijacking of a Kuwaiti airliner en route from the Thai capital to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. In a report submitted to the cabinet of ministers, the committee headed by Justice Minister <PERSON> Dhari </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Othman </PERSON> also said insufficient security measures taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwaiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwaiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> `` helped the hijackers to commit their crime.'' `` Despite the fact that the committee was unable to determine how the hijackers managed to smuggle their arms into the plane, the lax security measures at <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> airport have undoubtedly facilitated the crime to take place,'' Minister of State for Foreign Affairs <PERSON> Rashed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Rashed </PERSON> told reporters. He said a second committee had been formed to deal with implementing the report's recommendations. Moslem Shiite hijackers seized the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 April 5, beginning a 16-day ordeal during which they killed two passengers. The plane was taken to <LOCATION> Mashdad </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, then to the Mediterranean island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and finally to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> where the hijackers surrendered and were given safe conduct.

 A Chilean teacher leader gave emotional thanks Sunday to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> for aiding his union's struggle to oust the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> regime and restore democracy to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. `` We believe that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> means war; we mean peace. We believe that votes will overcome the rifles,'' <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Verduge </PERSON> told the AFT convention. `` We believe that democracy can be reinstated once again in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>, president of the 100,000-member Colegio de Profesores de <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, is on parole, awaiting sentencing from his arrest two years ago for leading protest strikes. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>, who needed a ruling from the <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to leave the country to deliver his speech here, said, `` Today is a historic moment for the teachers' union movement in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' Verdugo addressed the 3,000 delegates in Spanish. A translator repeated his remarks. He said his countrymen were commited to a peaceful movement to rid <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> of the government of Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. `` After 12 years of lack of freedom to do anything, we feel that there will never be any change ... to benefit education or any Chilean if we can not first overcome the -LRB- <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> -RRB- regime,'' he said. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>'s union is leading a campaign for a no vote on a plebscite expected this fall that would give <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> eight more years in power. The AFT delegates adopted a resolution urging local affiliates `` to send financial, political and moral support'' to <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>'s union <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> called it `` an extremely difficult day for me as I stand before you to share what we are going through in my country.'' `` On behalf of all the teachers in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> we wish to thank you for giving us the opportunity of being here,'' said <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>. `` Our fight is not only a fight for the teachers. It's not only a fight for education. It is really a fight to try to recoup and recover our democracy in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` With your help and solidarity and support, we will win the battle,'' He concluded to a standing ovation. AFT President <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said, `` It is hard for any one of us to imagine how much courage it takes to do what <PERSON> Oswaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> has done.'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said that when he visited <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> last October as part of an international delegation, they visited `` a cemetery to pay our respects to other union leaders who tried to take on the regime in the last few years.'' A yes vote would extend <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s rule for eight years. A no vote could lead to an open election for president by March 1990. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>, who spent 50 days in jail in 1986, said afterwards he was unsure what he will do next on his American visit. `` I know only that I have to be back in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> by July 15,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> expressed regret at the downing of an Iranian airliner by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship Sunday but said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces had the right to defend themselves in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said the incident `` underlines the urgent need for an early end to the Iran-Iraq conflict, including an end to all attacks on shipping.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said in a statement the government deeply regretted the loss of life in the attack. But she added: `` We understand that in the course of an engagement following an Iranian attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force, warnings were given to an unidentified aircraft apparently closing with a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. warship.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it mistook the jetliner for an Iranian warplane. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it expressed `` heartfelt condolences to the victims and their bereaved family members and hope earnestly that a sad incident like this will never occur again.'' Airline sources said some Japanese nationals were among the 290 aboard the plane. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said all aboard were killed. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> hopes the incident will not lead to the widening of tensions in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and appeals again for the necessity of an early peaceful solution to the Iran-Iraq conflict,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> newspaper defended the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action, saying it resulted from the confused situation in the war-torn <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` The situation in the gulf, where warships and tankers, bombers and passenger airliners are on the move near one another, does not exclude the possibility'' that non-combatants could accidentally become victims, the newspaper said in an editorial to appear Monday. `` No one can seriously make the accusation that this catastrophe resulted from pre-meditation by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the newspaper said. In the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman called the downing of the Iranian airliner `` a very regrettable incident in a complicated situation.'' `` The Americans themselves are launching a further investigation and we'll await the outcome of that,'' said the spokesman, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Vliet </PERSON>. The French government said it learned `` with consternation'' of the loss of the Iranian airliner. A statement issued in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said all possible light should be shed on `` the conditions in which such a tragic misunderstanding could have happened.'' Also in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouhani </PERSON>, spiritual head of the Shiite Moslem community in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, made public a telegram he said he sent President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in which he deplored the `` savage act of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> navy against the Iranian civilian plane.'' The Paris-based <PERSON> Rouhani </PERSON>, who opposes Iranian leader <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> but supports the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, said he demanded in the telegram the resignation of the naval commander involved in the incident and the `` prosecution of the authors of this horrible homicide.'' Dr. M.T. <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON>, president of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, urged in a telegram to the White House that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` personally apologize to the Iranian people and government.'' He also called on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to `` offer to pay compensation to the victims of the tragedy and withdraw the American naval power from the gulf as soon as possible.'' In <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, the Argentine government expressed its `` deepest consternation'' Sunday night over the downing of the Iranian jet. The government, in a communique, extended its condolences to the people of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the families of the victims and said it `` awaited a clarification of the circumstances and responsibilities'' involved in the incident.

 Many Americans partied in the sunshine Sunday on the second day of the Fourth of July weekend, while Iowans welcomed Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace walkers into their churches, singing songs and exchanging gifts. A Union general was belatedly honored with a statue at the site of the Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, and the heritage and culture of the American Indian was celebrated at a powwow in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In some drought states, firefighters had to spend the holiday sticking close to their equipment because of the danger that fireworks could set tinder-dry fields ablaze. Rain was scattered across the South and the northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, but there was sunshine for most of the rest of the nation for picnics, baseball games, beach parties and back yard barbecues. The warm, sunny weather attracted thousands to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to enjoy the seashore, rivers and lakes. `` I can almost feel the state tipping,'' joked senior collector <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> at the York toll boths on the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION>, where he estimated northbound traffic at a couple of thousand vehicles an hour. Several of the 220 Soviets and 100 Americans peace walkers in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> began their Sunday visiting about two dozen churches in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and surrounding communities. The walk began June 17 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and is scheduled to end July 16 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Several Soviet walkers brought guitars and other musical instruments to play at worship services, while some church choirs, like the one at <ORGANIZATION> Zion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, sang songs of welcome for the visitors. `` We are gathered here in your church together to pray for peace in the world, to save the sacred gift of life on this <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Oleinik </PERSON>, a Russian Orthodox priest, said through an interpreter at a joint Russian-English service at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mennonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>. In an emotional ceremony near a stone wall where Union forces withstood a desperate Confederate attack on the third and final day of the Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> 125 years ago, a bronze statue of Philadelphia-born Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbon </PERSON> was dedicated before about 500 spectators. <PERSON> Gibbon </PERSON> was the last of five <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> generals who were supposed to be memorialized on monuments as long ago as 1911. But the money earmarked by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> did n't go far enough and <PERSON> Gibbon </PERSON>'s statue was n't made until a private group started raising money a couple of years ago. Four descendants of <PERSON> Gibbon </PERSON>, who died nearly penniless in 1896, helped unveil the bronze statue. Later Sunday, a flame that had been put out during the energy crisis 15 years ago was rekindled at the <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>'s towering Eternal Light Peace Memorial. `` I think the idea of rededicating it for peace, for a world united, is something they would be happy with,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, who witnessed the original lighting of the memorial in 1938 and whose relatives helped plan that ceremony. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> signed a city `` Declaration of Independence From Drugs'' modeled after the declaration of July 4, 1776. Early Monday, just after midnight, a 6.3-million-pound tracked transporter called a crawler was scheduled to set out at a snail's pace to move the space shuttle Discovery to its launch pad at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, a giant step toward <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first space shuttle flight since the Challenger tragedy A flag-waving ceremony was planned for the early-morning rollout when the 85-ton spaceship edged out of an assembly building into the glare of spotlights to start the 4.2-mile journey. Thousands of workers who have labored to return the shuttle fleet to space were invited to attend. Monday's parade in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, will feature stiff competition between two precision parade units _ the <ORGANIZATION> Westchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Invitational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> and the Westchester Precision Lawn Mower Drill Team. The mowers had dominated the parade until last year when the shopping cart jockeys won `` Best New Entry.'' `` Every time we did something stupid, people applauded,'' said shopping cart team member <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>. `` If we do n't get applause this time, we'll just take our blouses off.'' But while many people celebrated, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> firefighting crews were on standby over the holiday weekend to douse any flames caused by fireworks above tinder-dry fields. Five fires in the <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> area of central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> alone were started by illegal firecrackers Friday, said <ORGANIZATION> DNR </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON>. Fire officials in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> said they found evidence that an 870-acre brushfire burning out of control Sunday evening near Yosemite National Park may have been caused by illegal fireworks. A few scattered groups of campers along the <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> were told to leave the area, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION>. In dry <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Williamson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> firefighters were on alert through Monday because of residents using fireworks despite a ban, emergency management director <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` One-fourth of our manpower have to remain close to the main station'' for the holiday, he said. Some <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> communities decided to reschedule fireworks displays until later in the summer in hopes that the fire danger will eventually be reduced by rain. `` We are having a lot of postponements. You may be seeing shows from now until Halloween,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perri </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Princess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fireworks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, police prepared for the Fourth of July by confiscating more than a ton of illegal fireworks in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. City authorities said they have confiscated 3,000 cases of illegal fireworks this year, compared with 2,815 last year. On Lake of the Ozarks in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, one holiday weekend gathering ended in flames Saturday when a 2,500-gallon gasoline tank ruptured and exploded outside a floating restaurant, injuring at least six people, one critically, authorities said. In upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Calico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dancers </ORGANIZATION>' 1988 Goodtime Powwow celebrating American Indian heritage and culture concluded Sunday with a War Dance Society ceremonial dance. Indian singers and dancers from as far away as <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> performed and competed. `` The dance is the matrix that draws everyone together,'' said dancer and emcee <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special envoy on Sunday urged members of the Afghan resistance to turn to their traditional local councils in forming a government after the departure of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, who negotiated the April 14 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord under which Soviet troops are withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, leaves Tuesday for the Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. There, he is expected to meet with President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> to try to negotiate a coalition government, which would include the Moslem rebels. But the seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance, headquartered in this northwestern <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> city, has voted to boycott <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>' efforts, despite opposition from a more moderate faction The alliance has rejected any coalition government with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s ruling Marxist government, which the U.S.-backed rebels are fighting `` We would never accept a coalition government with the communists,'' said <PERSON> Mahmood </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasrat </PERSON>, an Afghan elder who spoke on behalf of about 200 refugees who met with <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> in a tent. `` We will fight until the last Soviet soldier and the communist regime -LRB- of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> -RRB- leaves <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hasrat </PERSON>. He echoed guerrilla charges that the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord did not bring peace to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> because the resistance was not involved in the negotiations. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> pleaded with the rebels to turn to a solution `` that will have the legitimacy to gather the kind of support you need now to have a government acceptable to all Afghan people.'' The Peshawar-based Afghan resistance has said that the Moslem rebels will hold elections within 90 days in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and in Pakistani refugee camps, which house about 4 million Afghan refugees. `` This is the time for you to use your traditions to solve your problems in a political way and in an Afghan way,'' said <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>. The traditional Afghan decision-making method is a council whose members are chosen from the communities. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said everyone, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, `` will accept the decision of Afghans taken in a legitimate manner.'' <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> pointed out that half of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops, which first invaded <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979, will be gone by Feb. 15. He said 30,000 Soviet troops have already left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` As Soviet troops withdraw, if military confrontation continues, only Afghans will die,'' he said. `` The whole Afghan countryside will be in your hands and you can decide what to do with your country.'' <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, where he met with Afghan guerrillas in exiled in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Most of them are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Shia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> sect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, a minority in Sunni Moslem-dominated <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said the majority of them complained they had been left out of the guerrilla movement. Since arriving in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Thursday, <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> also met with President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>.

 A 75-year-old black nationalist leader jailed for terrorism has been discharged from a hospital and returned to prison, a newspaper reported Sunday. <PERSON> Zephania </PERSON> <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON>, president of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Pan-Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- PAC -RRB-, was said to be seriously ill when he was transferred from <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> Prison to <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nightingale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Monday last week. <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Urbania </PERSON> told City Press her husband had since been returned to prison but was in good spirits.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared Sunday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jetliner was `` a proper defensive action,'' and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers believed they were fending off an attacking Iranian fighter that ignored seven warnings. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the incident a `` terrible human tragedy'' and said, `` We deeply regret any loss of life.'' The incident occurred on the second of two days of skirmishes between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on oil lanes through the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, at the mouth of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the plane, a commercial Airbus carrying 290 people from the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> port of <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, was hit by two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles and that all aboard were presumed dead. Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, said there had been a visual sighting as the missiles hit the craft and that eyewitnesses had seen the craft `` disintegrate.'' He said the incoming craft had not been visually identified when the missiles were fired, but defended the commander who he said ordered the firing in the belief his ship was in jeopardy. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said it had been thought the incoming aircraft was an Iranian F-14 fighter, the most lethal plane owned by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship which fired was the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION>, an Aegis class cruiser equipped with sophisticated radar and missiles. The airliner was four or five miles outside the commercial corridor between <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> and a joint civilian-military airfield at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, and flew directly at the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship exchanged fire with several of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Boghammer gunboats, said <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and a smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate, the USS <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, firing 5-inch guns, sank two Iranian patrol boats and damaged a third, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The number of victims aboard the Iranian boats was not known. No American casualties were reported. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, was quick to react to the incident. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s crime today in downing an Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> is ... new evidence of American crimes and mischiefs, crimes which expose <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s nature more than ever before,'' it said. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has a lock on the Republican presidential nomination, learned about the incident during a conference call with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other senior administration officials. He had no immediate comment, a spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his likely Democratic opponent in November, said, `` Plainly our armed forces have a right to defend themselves when attacked.'' He said, however, that the downing of the plane is further evidence that `` the war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> must end. We and the international community have a responsibility to stop it.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` It is not enough just to be sorry. ... The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has been more than a year in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and still there is no defined policy, still no firm commitment to end the war.'' Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he would `` reserve judgment until receiving further information. Another member of the committee, Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said that from what he knows so far, `` it seems reasonable to believe that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> acted in an appropriate manner. `` Like others, I, too, have many unanswered questions,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. `` I'll reserve final judgment until I have more details.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> early Sunday announced that the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> had shot down an Iranian F-14, but hours later sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that military officials had come to believe the identification of the craft was wrong. At 1:30 p.m. EDT, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> appeared before reporters to say he now believed the downed aircraft was a civilian airliner. As <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> spoke, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ in a statement read by spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> _ promised a full investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jet was headed directly for the USS Vincennes. `` When the aircraft failed to heed repeated warnings, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> followed standing orders and widely publicized procedures, firing to protect itself against possible attack,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his statement. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> expressed `` deep regret'' over the loss of life but emphasized time and again that the military commanders in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> had `` acted with good judgment'' in that they believed American ships were being approached by a hostile aircraft. As the aircraft approached the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, it dropped in altitude and accelerated to about 450 knots, as a warplane would do if preparing to fire an anti-ship missile, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. Those actions and electronic transmissions `` led us to believe it was a military aircraft,'' he said. In the seven minutes between the detection of the aircraft on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> radar and the firing of the missiles, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship `` sent three warnings on a civilian distress network and four warnings on a military distress network.'' The Iranian aircraft `` neither answered nor changed its course,'' he said. `` There were electronic warnings on the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> that led it to believe the aircraft was an Iranian F-14,'' but which <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> described as classified and refused to discuss. Most civilian aircraft emit signals identifying themselves and monitor specific civilian radio frequencies. When the Iranian aircraft was `` about nine miles away, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> fired two Standard surface-to-air-missiles, at least one of which hit at an approximate range of six miles,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said he did not intend to imply that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> sent the airliner into the combat zone on purpose, but said `` if a country's going to wage combat operations in a certain area and then send a commercial airliner in there during that, of course it's an accident waiting to happen. An Iranian F-4 was sighted a few minutes later by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> radar, but did not approach the combat zone, and no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes were in the area, he said. `` The important points here are, the commanding officer has a responsibility to protect his people, his unit. He is engaged already in a surface action, he has a minimum amount of time,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. `` It is logical to conclude that while he is firing and they are approaching him and an aircraft lifts off from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, goes toward him, steady course, high speed, decreasing altitude, will not vary, will not contact him _ it's a more logical conclusion that he may very well be in jeopardy.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces had been alerted that the Iranians `` might attempt to carry out attacks against our forces over the July Fourth holiday period'' and that there had been a number of F-14 flights in the area over the last few days. In his statement, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I am saddened to report that it appears that in a proper defensive action by the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> this morning in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> an Iranian airliner was shot down over the Strait of Hormuz.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who was at Camp David for the Fourth of July weekend, received a telephone call at 4:52 a.m. EDT from national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who told him that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces believed they had shot down an Iranian F-14. He received another update in writing at 8:11 a.m. that noted the Iranian claim that a civilian jetliner had been downed. At 9:50 a.m., he was told that the Iranian allegations might be correct. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had no plans to return to the White House before noon Monday. `` The only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> is peace, and this tragedy reinforces the need to achieve that goal with all possible speed,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. On Saturday, the <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> responded to a distress call from a <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> merchant vessel, the <PERSON> Karama </PERSON> <PERSON> Maersk </PERSON>, that was being harassed by Iranian gunboats in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> dispersed the Iranian craft with a warning shot, believed to be the first exchange of fire since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sank an Iranian frigate, badly damaged a second, and set fire to two Iranian oil platforms last April.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Picks Gov. Angeloz As 1989 Presidential Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s governing party chose <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> Provincial Gov <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> as its 1989 presidential candidate Sunday in a nationwide internal party election, party officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials said returns covering more than half the votes cast gave an overwhelming 88 percent to <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> and his vice presidential running mate <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casella </PERSON> and 12 percent to their opponents, Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeregui </PERSON>. <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, 56, supported by <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> and most leaders of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, had been expected to win easily over <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, who had said his candidacy was aimed simply at providing party members with a choice. Final official results were not expected until Monday. Officials estimated about 30 percent of the party's 2.2 million members cast votes in the Sunday election. The leading opposition Justicialist -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party was to select its presidential candidate in a similar election Saturday pitting Buenos Aires Provincial Gov. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cafiero </PERSON> against La Rioja Gov. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>. National elections are expected in May or June of 1989 to replace <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, whose election to a six-year term in 1983 ended nearly eight years of rightist military rule. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> is prohibited by the constitution from seeking a second consecutive term. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> admitted defeat even before the party polls closed and congratulated <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, now in his second term as governor of the north-central province of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION>, on his victory. Backed by his party's moderate and rightist sectors, <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> based his campaign on the need to modernize the nation's debt-ridden economy, spur techological advancement and continue programs of privatization and economic deregulation begun by <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>

<TEXT>
 The USS Vincennes' destruction of an Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard was a tragic result of its captain and crew doing their duty, members of the ship's namesake organization said Sunday. `` On the basis of what we can find out on news reports, the captain acted the best way he knew how,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Commercial </ORGANIZATION> newspaper and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The association is made up mostly of men who served on the two ships of that name during World War II. The current USS Vincennes is the fourth naval vessel to bear the name of this southwestern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> city. `` The other thing, in my opinon, this is the other side of the Stark incident,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said, referring to the May 1987 Iraqi jet attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile frigate Stark, which cost 37 American lives. `` If the captain had stayed there and not done anything, we might have been reading about loss of life on the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Brroks </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jet shot down was a commercial Airbus carrying 290 people from the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> port of <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. The news agency said all aboard were presumed dead. The two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles were fired by <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION>, an Aegis class cruiser equipped with sophisticated radar and missiles. The current 9,600-ton <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was the third in a new class of guided missile Aegis-type cruisers and was christened April 14, 1984, at <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and commisioned on July 6, 1985. It was the fourth <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship to bear the name of <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. The first was commissioned in 1826 and assigned to service in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. It was decommissioned in 1867. Association member <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, 65, of <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, served on the second USS Vincennes, a heavy cruiser commissioned in 1937 and sunk by Japanese cruisers in 1942. A light cruiser named for <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was commissioned in 1944 and received six battle stars for service in World War II before it was decommissioned in September 1946. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> said he met the captain of the newest ship, Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, at an association meeting in <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> in August. `` I met the skipper last summer and he's a real captain and level-headed and I think he did the proper thing,'' he said. The association's 500 members meet annually in <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> to reminisce about their years of service and pay tribute to the dead, said <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> liaison officer and honorary member, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Toth </PERSON>, 64. Members of the association were considering a tribute to the 290 people who were killed. `` There's no way of rectifying this kind of situation, so all we can do is remember these people,'' <PERSON> Toth </PERSON> said. `` Our prayers and those of the commuity are with the ship's commander and crew members.'' `` From what I've heard about the ship, it's like everybody on it is family and they're trying to be the best in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Toth </PERSON> said. `` But, as this incident shows, that can be good and bad.'' `` It's a hard situation today. Until all the knews came in it was hard to really understand what happened over there,'' said <PERSON> Toth </PERSON>. `` We have such a close tie to the ship and its personnel, we regret the situation that happened as far as the civilians involved.'' `` But the captain defended the ship and did what he thought was best for the personnel,'' he added.

<TEXT>
 A former rooming house left over from an earlier era of <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> summer tourism is the home of the ultra-traditional <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> convent that's been disrupted by the puzzling story of a novice nun taken away by her family. Rising behind the aging rooming house that has housed the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION>'s Novitiate Convent for four years are the still skeletal beginnings of a new novitiate, what the Rev. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> calls `` a proper convent.'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said last week he does n't envision any problems filling the new building, although it would mean doubling the ranks of the fledgling order of the Daughters of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, a group of nuns opposed to modernism and church reform. `` We've had very encouraging signs,'' he said. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> foresees growth in a brand of Catholicism that is n't recognized by the local diocese, does n't accept the reforms of the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> but endorses the ultimate infallibility of the pope Members of the community perform all Masses in Latin, and the sisters wear traditional long black habits, unlike those of many orders that have accepted modern dress. Attention was drawn to so-called `` traditional Catholicism'' last week when Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> was excommunicated for defying the pope after years of fighting the `` satanic influence'' of modernism. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novitiate </ORGANIZATION> itself was in the news last week when the family of a 22-year-old novice nun, until recently members of an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> church affiliated with the convent, came to the Catskills and abducted the young woman. Although officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> issued arrest warrants for the woman's father and brothers, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Greve </PERSON> told officials in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> after a four-day disappearance that she was not being held against her will. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said he fears <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Greve </PERSON>, known at the convent as Sister <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON>, had been brainwashed by her family. The convent is run by the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> V </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> association </ORGANIZATION>, which also operates affiliated schools and churches on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. It was during his involvement with those institutions that <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> saw a need for `` an unliberated convent situation,'' he said in a recent interview. `` There was always a pressing need to have sisters,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, the convent's spiritual adviser. `` I received petitions from young women who wanted to become religious, to become nuns, but they could not find a traditional convent.'' Traditional means `` the way that religious congregations were before the changes of the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'' 23 years ago, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. At the convent there are 10 postulants, women who took a temporary vow of silence at the end of their first year of preparation for the sisterhood; a second-year novice, and three professed nuns. Six other professed nuns teach at an affiliated school on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The nuns follow a strict schedule, with everyone rising at 5:30 a.m., attending several Masses, devotions and classes, performing chores like lawn work and washing dishes and fulfilling one of the convent's missions through a designated holy hour. `` The sisters have as their primary work, the work of consoling the heart of the son of God,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. During this holy hour, 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. every day but Thursday when it's 11 p.m. to midnight, nuns try to make up for people's indifference to <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s sacrifices, said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> This duty fulfills the mission of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, described by <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> as `` a very obscure nun in an obscure convent in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' He said women training to be nuns are free to leave the vocation at any time and are given many opportunities to do so during their nine-year training. Miss <PERSON> Greve </PERSON>'s family kept her whereabouts a secret. `` This has been tough on all of us. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> is very upset,'' one of her brothers said. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> officials quoted the <PERSON> Greves </PERSON> as saying they took their daughter because they were upset by a lack of communication with the convent. But <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Greves </PERSON> could have visited their daughter. `` They did n't even avail themselves of all the opportunities they had to visit her.'' He speculated on why the family took the young woman from the convent. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Greve </PERSON> does not want her pretty daughter to be a nun,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jetliner with about 290 passengers crashed near the Strait of Hormuz in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Sunday, and claimed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> shot it down while battling Iranian gunboats. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said 100 bodies had been recovered by Iranian rescue teams and that everyone aboard the Airbus A300 jetliner was feared dead.

 Meteorologists know that a stalled high pressure system and a split jet stream are causing the drought in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but they are at a loss to explain why the phenomena occurred and when they might end. In a high-pressure system, also known as an anticyclone, dry air gradually descends toward the ground and moves in a clockwise pattern around the center. It is the opposite of a cyclone, where rising, moist, counterclockwise winds promote the development of clouds, and thus rain.

<HEAD>Government Teamster-Takeover Efforts Dissolve Union's Ties to GOP</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government attempt to take control of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> has dissolved a three-decade marriage of convenience between the nation's largest union and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> while forging an unlikely alliance: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>. `` To try and put in trusteeship a complete union like the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> ... smacks of totalitarianism,'' says <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, a conservative Republican from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, who is an outspoken critic of unions but fervent defender of Teamster President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>. `` It's the kind of thing you would expect in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, not the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said of the government's suit last week branding the union corrupt and seeking to dethrone <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and 17 other top Teamster officers. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also condemned the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s use of the 1970 Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organization -LRB- RICO -RRB- Act to place the 1.6-million-member union under the supervision of a court-appointed trustee. `` Such an extreme remedy is fundamentally inconsistent with the very concept of independent and democratic trade unions,'' he said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who with union support has wrapped up the Democratic presidential nomination, said he would vigorously prosecute and seek to remove from office individual union leaders, corporate executives or government appointees who misuse their jobs. `` However, I simply see no need to resort to an extreme legal approach that would unnecessarily deprive rank-and-file union members of their right of self-governance,'' he said. Equally ironic is what Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have in common on the government's proposal to take over the Teamsters: Neither has anything to say about it `` Do n't wait on us for a reaction,'' said a spokesman for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the liberal, pro-union chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, whose brother <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> succeeded in putting both <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s father and former Teamster President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> in jail. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined a solicitation from labor leaders to all of the presidential candidates to criticize the government's anticipated takeover attempt when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> was still putting the suit together. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, two one-time contenders for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, both eagerly responded to Teamster pleas for support, as did all of the Democratic candidates. With the biggest campaign war chest of any group in the country _ 50 percent larger than the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s this year _ Teamster leaders for decades have danced with politicians from both parties while prosecutors pursued them in court. Lost in the glare of publicity over the Teamsters' support for Republicans <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the presidency was the flow of most of its money in congressional and state races to Democrats. In 1986, for example, 87 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' campaign money in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> races went to Democrats. But with a political fund of $ 4 million two years ago and $ 6 million so far this year, the union has plenty of cash to spread among members of both parties. `` The majority of Teamsters are probably Democrats,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` Most of the people they endorse are Democrats. But that has nothing to do with the philosophical and legal approach being used here. This is not what you do to free institutions in our society.'' Whether it's the campaign dollars or the fact that one of every 70 workers in the country is a Teamster, the union has no problem raising an outcry from politicians to counter the government's prosecutors Prior to the filing of the suit last week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, at least 269 of the 535 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> signed letters to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> condemning the suit as `` a precedent which strikes at the very foundation of government.'' `` If the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government can move in and take over the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, they can take over the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, any business, any entity,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., a former Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s indictment in 1986 on embezzlement charges fractured a Teamster alliance with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> administrations and presidential candidates dating back to the middle 1950s. But Teamster presidents have been indicted before _ three of the last four of them under <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> administrations _ and the wounds have always healed by the time the next presidential election came around. However, when leaks to the press about the government's takeover suit began surfacing a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> abandoned any lingering notion of cutting their own deal this year with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> against the Democratic leanings of the rest of the labor movement. Anticipation of the suit and reports that three more just like it were being prepared against the Laborers, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longshoreman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the Hotel and Restaurant Workers helped catalyze a reunion of the Teamsters and the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> last October after a 30-year rift. `` The future will hold that the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union being back in the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, joining forces together, are going to create the greatest political giant this country has ever seen,'' <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> said then. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> is forgoing an official presidential endorsement this year until after the Republican National Convention in August, when it will convene and formally poll the presidents of its 91 affiliated unions. But like many other union chiefs, <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, who is acting as the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' president while <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> recovers from brain and lung surgery for cancer, has spoken favorably of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` The bloom was off the lily a long time ago with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said one senior Teamster official. `` We'll take our lead from the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>.''

 When thousands of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers across the nation vote on a proposed three-year contract later this week, one union will urge approval of the contract but call it inadequate at the same time. Members of the Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- UE -RRB-, which claims a membership of 9,400, and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Salaried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- IUE -RRB-, which has about 40,000 members, will vote on the contract Wednesday and Thursday, <LOCATION> UE </LOCATION> union spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said Saturday. The unions represent GE production and maintenance workers nationwide. Their last contract expired June 30. After meeting to discuss the proposal Friday, the UE voted to recommend acceptance rather than call for a strike because of disagreement among the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> IUE </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said. He said some IUE negotiators recommended acceptance of the proposal and others called for rejection. Some executive boards of major <ORGANIZATION> IUE </ORGANIZATION> locals voted to approved it while others rejected it, he said. `` Under the current circumstances, an effective nationwide strike against <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> is impossible,'' the union said in a written statement. `` While we firmly believe the company's offer is inadequate, we can not lead our members into a long strike that has virtually no chance of success because of the lack of unity.'' The agreement was reached June 26, between the company and the two unions, which are the largest of the 14 <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> unions and the only ones to negotiate national contracts. The other 12, with a combined membership of about 20,000, also were represented on the negotiating team, <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said. `` It's a very modest agreement'' with minimal increases in wages and cost-of-living adjustments, he said. Workers would lose in other areas, including medical insurance, night-shift pay and wages for newly-hired workers, he said. Lessons learned from a 102-day strike in 1969 show that `` it takes total unity of all unions in <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> to take this company on and win,'' the UE statement said. GE thinks the agreement is fair, said spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Batty </PERSON>, who works at the company's <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, headquarters. `` We believe that it's a good contract and that once the union membership understands it, they will ratify it,'' <PERSON> Batty </PERSON> said. The agreement calls for three wage increases: 2.5 percent this year, 1.5 percent in 1989 and 1.5 percent in 1990 plus a $ 165 cash payment in July 1988 and a $ 900 payment in June 1989.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, already the world's largest debtor country, could see its foreign debt increase to more than $ 2 trillion by 1995, seriously cutting into American living standards, a congressional study said. The report relesed Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> rejected claims by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that the country's status as a large debtor country was not cause for concern. The study predicted that while the country's trade deficit will finally show an improvement this year, after deteriorating for six years, this improvement could be short-lived. The report forecast that the deficit in the broadest measure of trade, the current account, would fall to $ 151 billion this year, down slightly from a record $ 154 billion deficit in 1987. The report predicted a further decrease to $ 129 billion in 1989, saying these improvements were virtually assured given the declines in the value of the dollar that have already taken place. But the study said the trade deficit would begin rising again sharply in the 1990s and could hit $ 326 billion by 1995. The study said it based this outlook on assumptions that the dollar does not decline further in value and that current growth rates and interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> relative to other countries remain essentially unchanged. The dollar has actually been rising in recent weeks, prompting concern among economists who believe the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency still needs to drop for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit to narrow further. A cheaper dollar makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports more attractive on overseas markets and imports more expensive to Americans. If the dollar does not decline, the report projected that the heavy import penetration the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has suffered through the 1980s will continue. The string of higher trade imbalances would mean that the country's position as a net debtor would worsen as well. The government announced on Thursday that total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign debt increased to $ 368.2 billion at the end of 1987, further lengthening the country's lead as the world's largest debtor nation. This means that foreigners now own more in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments than Americans own in overseas investments. The congressional study projected that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign debt would climb to $ 576 billion at the end of this year and surpass $ 1 trillion in 1991. By the end of 1995, the total foreign debt would be $ 2.06 trillion, or one-fourth of the country's total gross national product, the report said. A debt of that size would require an annual payment of $ 96 billion to foreigners to service the debt, an amount equal to 1.2 percent of the projected GNP for that year, the study said. That would mean if the GNP increased by 3 percent in 1995, a generally optimistic outlook, one-third of the increase would be siphoned off to meet debt obligations to foreigners. `` If, on the other hand, we are pessimistic about real growth prospects, seeing only a 1 percent annual increase as likely, then debt service would tend to preclude any improvement in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> living standards in the next decade,'' the report said. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who requested the congressional study, said it showed that without a dramatic change in the country's trade policies, the size of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foreign debt will explode over the next six years. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was a key sponsor of an omnibus trade measure recently vetoed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He is leading the effort to get a stripped-down version less objectionable to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> passed into law. `` Even though the trade deficit will go down a little this year and again a little bit next year, unless trade policies dramatically change, then they're going to start up,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. The congressional study, while presenting a pessimistic view of what could happen, is not out of line with projections made by private economists. <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said that depending on what happens to the dollar, world growth rates and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal budget deficit, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foreign debt burden could be anywhere from $ 900 billion to $ 2.5 trillion by 1995. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt of $ 368.2 billion for 1987 was 36.8 percent higher than the previous year and served to illustrate how fast the foreign debt is accumulating. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had an investment cushion of $ 89.4 billion as recently as 1983, making it the world's largest creditor nation, a position now held by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Democratic critics hope to make the country's slide from the largest creditor nation to the largest debtor nation an issue in this year's presidential campaign. They contend that the burgeoning foreign debt is eroding <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s political and economic standing in the world. But the administration, sensitive to the issue in an election year, held a lengthy briefing last Thursday, when the new debt total was released, to argue that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not be considered in a class with such large Third World debtors as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. `` We are nowhere near getting into trouble,'' <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> told reporters. He said that foreigners still own no more than 5 percent of the assets in an economy that turns out $ 4.5 trillion in goods and services a year. But private economists contend that the growing foreign debt makes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> more vulnerable to pressure from foreign investors, driving up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates and heightening the volatility of the dollar.

<HEAD>Report Criticizes Federal Efforts to Help Female Business Owners</HEAD>

 Most federal efforts to halt discrimination against female business owners have been `` superficial, unimaginative and lacking in long-term commitment,'' a bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report said. The report released Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also concluded that `` the federal government has been seriously delinquent'' in helping female entrepreneurs gain access to government contracts and subcontracts. Furthermore, the report said, women face gender-related barriers that severely limit their access to business credit. It also said that statistics on female entrepreneurs are insufficient to help policy makers deal with these problems. Women owned 25 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses in 1982 but received only 10 percent of business receipts, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. Business size and type account for some but not all of the discrepancy, the report said. `` There are other, less defensible reasons _ namely sex stereotyping and continued discrimination,'' the report said. `` Women have had to work harder, wait longer, manage with fewer dollars, and be content with smaller operations just to maintain their present levels of independence and business success.'' The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, plans to introduce an Omnibus Women's Business Ownership bill later this month along with Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., head of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> on Women's Issues In a statement accompanying his committee's report, <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON> said that the bill will address the four principal barriers blocking equal economic status for female entrepreneurs _ lack of management training and technical assistance, lack of access to capital, `` the virtual exclusion'' of women from government contracts, and lack of accurate and timely data on female-owned businesses. According to the report, women owned less than 5 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses 15 years ago compared with 28 percent today. They are starting firms at twice the rate of men and are expected to own 50 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses by the year 2000. `` These women are part of the most educated generation of women that has ever existed. They are a gold mine of human capital,'' the report said. `` It is essential that remaining barriers to women entrepreneurship be eliminated.'' The committee recommended a number of steps to correct problems that came to light during a series of hearings on the issue. Among them: _ Establishment of a <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> with both public and private representatives, to develop an action plan that includes goals and timetables The plan would be due at the end of 1989. _ Creating a guaranteed mini-loan program within the Small Business Administration for loans of up to $ 50,000 Firms in the fast-growing service sector, where female-owned businesses are concentrated, would be targeted. _ Requiring the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to limit inquiries into marital status for commercial loans, and requiring lending institutions to notify clients of their right to learn why they were denied loans _ Forming a public-private partnership fund to provide management training and technical assistance for female business owners _ Reforming the federal procurement system to give women greater access to contracts and subcontracts, including annual participation goals _ Requiring large government contractors, by statute, to establish subcontracting goals for female-owned businesses _ Developing a high-quality computer listing of firms controlled by women

 Struggling <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has closed its upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> production facilitied until July 11, a published report said. Security guards at the plants in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mayfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, said workers were given Friday off as a paid holiday, The <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. The guards said the plants also would be closed this week, but employees would not be paid for that time off. About 110 people work at the <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> plants. The company's ability to make this week's payroll was questioned after a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court issued a restraining order Wednesday, freezing <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> bank accounts in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> at the request of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> suppliers who had not been paid. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leatherworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s production workers at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> plants, could not be reached for comment Friday. The company's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> headquarters were closed for the long holiday weekend, but a security guard said the offices would reopen Tuesday. Company Chairman <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said Friday his company has enough funds to carry it through another week. He said a group of 12 foreign and domestic lenders to which <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> owes $ 103 million agreed to provide money to the company through Thursday. <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>, recuperating at home from open-heart surgery, said no steps had been taking toward a bankruptcy filing. If anything is to happen, it would be this week, he said. On Thursday, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> toy company gave up on its plan to restructure its debts after it had repeatedly extended a deadline for agreement by debtholders. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> had proposed exchanging $ 335 million of bonds for a combination of new bonds and stock. The company said the exchange would save it millions of dollars a year in interest payments and supply cash for the business. The original exchange terms were rejected by some of the bondholders, who contended the exchange would have reduced the value of their investment without requiring similar sacrifices from <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s stockholders and bankers. The company produces such well-known toys as Cabbage Patch Kids dolls and Scrabble board games. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> has been trying since January to cut costs and restructure its finances. It lost $ 47.4 million in the quarter that ended April 2. It has lost money in four of the past five years, including $ 215 million in the last two years.

 <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heil </PERSON> has purchased 6.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Morrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knudsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, but Wall Street analysts dismissed speculation he might try to take over the engineering, shipbuilding and construction company. In a statement filed with federal regulators, <PERSON> Heil </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb <PERSON> Downers </PERSON> <PERSON> Grove </PERSON>, said his purchase of 670,300 <ORGANIZATION> Morrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knudsen </ORGANIZATION> shares was intended as an investment, but also said he wanted to win a seat on the company's board of directors. <PERSON> Heil </PERSON> is president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Neither he nor his attorney could be reached for comment. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON>, a major contractor for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, released a statement Friday saying the company was aware of <PERSON> Heil </PERSON>'s filing and `` reviewing the situation closely with its advisers.'' The company said it knew little about <PERSON> Heil </PERSON>, but noted he is a defendant in a lawsuit brought by the state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON> said the suit charged <PERSON> Heil </PERSON> and his company `` with a variety of fraudulent activities in connection with a construction project on which <PERSON> Heil </PERSON>'s company was a prime contractor.'' According to <PERSON> Ileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> attorney general's office, <PERSON> Heil </PERSON> was among 14 contracting companies and their officers named in a civil suit brought by the state over a major <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> convention center project Illinois Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> charged the contractors with submitting phony bills for labor and materials through dummy minority contractors. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON> said the suit sought to prevent any company of which <PERSON> Heil </PERSON> is a director from doing business with <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Since <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON> has a contract on a public project in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and is bidding on another, the company said it was `` investigating other potential violations of applicable law by <PERSON> Heil </PERSON>.'' Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts discounted a possible takeover attempt by <PERSON> Heil </PERSON>. `` He does n't represent a real threat'' to <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, an analyst at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc The company has `` disappointed certain people with their real estate write-offs and shipbuilding write-offs ... but they're trying to make their business more competitive and there is no reason to believe they wo n't,'' <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> said In the statement filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Heil </PERSON> revealed that he had acquired the outstanding <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON> common stock from May 12 through Thursday at prices ranging from just over $ 36 to nearly $ 41 a share. There are about 10.9 million shares of common stock outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Morrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knudsen </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 42 in trading Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, up 75 cents a share. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON> posted an operating loss for 1987, but has been undergoing a restructuring that included closing its real estate development subsidiary. In the first quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Morrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knudsen </ORGANIZATION> reported it earned $ 6.59 million, up 9 percent from $ 6.03 million in the first three months of 1987. As a defense against any unfriendly takeover attempts, the company adopted a `` poison pill'' stock purchase right in 1986. Under the plan, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON> shareholders can buy additional stock at a discount. While such a plan might not prevent a takeover, it would force hostile buyers to negotiate with the company's board before making such a move.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which failed in a takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> RTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> during the spring, has turned its sights toward <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> show. Mark IV, <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said it planned a substantial purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION> stock and was `` considering the possibility of acquiring the entire equity interest in <LOCATION> Armtek </LOCATION> through a negotiated merger transaction or by means of a cash tender offer,'' the company said in an <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> filing disclosed Friday. Mark IV, based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said it now owns less than 5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an Armtek spokesman, said any bid would be unsolicited. Armtek's stock rose 75 cents a share to close at $ 32 in heavy <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Friday. Armtek, formerly known as <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had $ 1.2 billion in sales last year.
