<TEXT>
 West German officials said the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government closed its <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> mission to the public Tuesday because its capacities were `` completely exhausted.'' The West German government accused <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of being responsible for a wave of refugees seeking to leave their communist homeland. Scores of East Germans have fled to West German diplomatic missions in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>; the Hungarian capital of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> officials said 130 East German citizens are in the West German mission in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and are refusing to leave, demanding that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> allow them to emigrate. Claus <LOCATION> Duisberg </LOCATION>, an aide to Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, called on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to `` create conditions ... that would give people reason for staying.'' A leading West German parliamentarian, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lintner </PERSON>, said East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> should either initiate political reforms or resign, a newspaper reported. `` <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and his old men should finally leave,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Cologne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted <PERSON> Lintner </PERSON> as saying. East German officials have refused to adopt political reforms like those under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Hundreds of East Germans have been trying to leave through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which has been dismantling border barriers along its frontier with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Seventy-two East Germans who fled through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> arrived at a temporary housing center in <LOCATION> Giessen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, on Tuesday after traveling by train from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. News reports say about 200 East Germans are inside the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, demanding that their government let them move to the West. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> news reports say about 20 East Germans are inside the West German mission in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> on Monday accused the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> of `` gross interference'' in East German's internal affairs. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> summoned <PERSON> Lothar </PERSON> <PERSON> Glienke </PERSON>, head of the East German diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, to the chancellery to protest the statement, said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government spokesman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> said West German officials also discussed the situation at the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> mission with <PERSON> Glienke </PERSON> and appealed to the East German government to `` contribute to the solution of these matters.'' `` The federal government wants to continue its constructive cooperation with the German Democratic Republic -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- despite this situation,'' <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> said. West German officials said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> agreed not to arrest refuge-seekers inside the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> mission if they leave the complex, but refused to guarantee they would be permitted to leave the country. The West German newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> reported the number of East Germans who moved to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ both legally and illegally _ increased dramatically since last year. It said the figure for the first seven months of this year was 55,970 compared with 39,832 for all of last year.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has broken a network of spies who provided the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> with intimate details and documents about Iranian military planning, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in Tuesday's editions. Citing unnamed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the Iranians had detected the network months before it actually collapsed and had used the spies to give the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> false information. But some officials told the Times that before the network was compromised, it yielded valuable military intelligence, particularly about the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s operations in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> at a time when American naval forces were confronting the Iranians. The network did not supply intelligence on hostage cases or political developments. The Times' sources confirmed for the first time Iranian claims that spies had been arrested. The sources said the Iranian military, many of whose members were trained in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was considered one of the less difficult groups in the country from which to recruit agents. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had more difficulty recruiting agents from among pro-Iranian militants or officials in the Iranian Government who deal with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. All of those in the dismantled intelligence ring were believed to be Iranians, the Times said. It was not known how <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> uncovered the operation or how long <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> used it to feed false information to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, when informed of the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> report, said, `` We do not comment on allegations of intelligence activity.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> first disclosed the existence of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operation on April 21, when <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who was then speaker of the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, told a Friday prayer meeting in <LOCATION> Teheran </LOCATION> about `` several dens of espionage.'' Over the next few months, Iranian television broadcast a succession of programs in which purported spies confessed to their roles. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials told the Times that the broadcasts _ which described everything from secret writing techniques to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> recruitment of agents through greed, entrapment and blackmail _ were a mixture of fact and fiction. Several officials told the Times that most of those identified were double agents controlled by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 A hot-air balloon that crashed and killed its pilot was leaking before take-off during a national competition, a federal investigator said Monday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, who was killed Saturday when his balloon deflated at 3,000 feet as thousands of spectators watched, should have noticed rips in the balloon's fabric during inflation, said <PERSON> Armond </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, an investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the pilot had looked closely at the balloon, he would have noticed the separations I showed you,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said at news conference where the balloon was displayed. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said he also was unable to locate a large thermometer required for the balloon by federal law. The device warns pilots about overheating. The balloon was 12 years old, although registration records showed that Mock of <LOCATION> Paonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, bought it in January, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. The average life of a hot-air balloon is 10 years, he said. Mock, a former crop-dusting pilot, had logged 180 hours of balloon flight time, most of it over the past 12 months. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said it was the first balloon fatality he has investigated that involved the fabric. Accidents involving power lines are the most common, he said. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said the fabric ripped `` at the top of the balloon. That's the most critical part. Once you lose that there's nothing you can do.'' Although only one seam ripped open Saturday, several other seams had begun to separate and could have split completely at any time, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. The fatality was the first in the 19-year history of the national balloon championship, officials said.

 <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thein </PERSON> gets some funny looks from motorists when he rides his bike to work. It could be his unusual posture _ leaning back with his feet pedaling in the air _ or the fact that he keeps up with traffic going 50 mph. `` People right here in town still look at me funny. They say, ` What's that? Where did you get that?,'' said <PERSON> Thein </PERSON>. `` The other day I was coming down the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> hill and was going 52 miles per hour.'' <PERSON> Thein </PERSON> is one of three workers at <ORGANIZATION> Kann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Guttenberg </PERSON> company that makes the Linear brand of recumbent bicycles. The company also makes aluminum semi-trailers, commercial work boats and grain-hauling bodies for trucks. Instead of the standard bicycle seat, the recumbent bicycle has a cushioned chair that supports a rider's back, making it easier to generate pedal power. The upright position of a rider also puts less pressure on the diaphragm for easier breathing, and the position allows for an unrestricted view without neck cramping. The Linear bike has an aluminum frame and under-the-seat steering so that a rider's arms hang down in their natural position. Its 18 gears are shifted by a flick of the thumb. The Linear, designed by company president <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kann </PERSON>, is the only recumbent on the market that can be folded. That enables the 7-foot bike to fit in a car trunk, <PERSON> Hansel </PERSON> said. `` You have to get used to it, but once you do, it's extremely comfortable. It's much more efficient than the traditional 10-speed or 12-speed,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansel </PERSON>, director of production and marketing at <LOCATION> Kann </LOCATION>. Recumbent bicycles have been around since the 1920s, <PERSON> Hansel </PERSON> said, and <PERSON> Kann </PERSON> has been making them for five years. The company hopes within two years to be making 1,200 recumbents annually. <PERSON> Hansel </PERSON> said the Linear, which retails for about $ 850, is faster than conventional bicycles. `` A recumbent would just walk away with it in a race,'' he said. The world record speed for bicycles _ 65 mph _ was set in the mid-1960s by an aerodynamic recumbent. However, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kukoda </PERSON>, a senior editor who road-tests bicycles for Bicycling magazine, said the recumbent has its disadvantages. `` I think they're inferior going up hills because there's no way to stand up. You're not able to use the biggest muscles in the body, the rear-end and lower back. I found it takes a lot more power and energy to climb hills,'' <PERSON> Kukoda </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the monthly's headquarters in <LOCATION> Emmaus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> disagrees <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> and a companion, <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, plan on Aug. 2 to embark on a 44,000-mile journey around the world riding Linear recumbents. `` When I'm going up a hill, I find I'm breathing easier and am not as tired when I get to the top than if I were hunched over a traditional bike. I'm able to recover a lot faster,'' <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Doctors used maggots to clean up rotted skin caused by a massive infection on a teen-ager's legs, and the treatment resulted in a remarkable recovery, her parents said. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillingham </PERSON>, 17, was stricken with <LOCATION> meningococcemia </LOCATION>, a blood-borne bacterial infection that eventually caused her to suffer heart failure, kidney problems, diseased skin and the loss of one foot and the toes on the other foot. She was critically ill when she was taken to <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on May 11. She was in fair condition Monday, a hospital spokeswoman said. Antibiotics used to treat the bacteria had caused blood clots, which reduced the flow of blood to her legs, resulting in the rotting of the skin on her lower legs, said the girl's father, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillingham </PERSON>. Her left foot and ankle and her toes on the right foot had to be amputated. Then doctors pondered how to clean the remaining skin. Antibiotics did not work fast enough. So on July 21, more than 1,500 fly larvae were scooped onto her legs with tongue depressors and secured with tape. Maggots eat only dead flesh, leaving healthy skin intact, said Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON>. After 36 hours, doctors used a high-pressure hose to wash them from her legs. The skin grafts are taking and she will soon be fitted with prostheses and learn to walk again, her family said. <PERSON> Dillingham </PERSON> called her recovery miraculous. He said the medical bills were expected to be as much as $ 750,000.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is poised to begin pumping money into the nation's failed savings and loan institutions as soon as possible after the president signs the bill on Wednesday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intends to enact the historic legislation in a White House ceremony on Wednesday, said administration and congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it will borrow the first $ 5 billion installment of the bailout on Thursday. The legislation, passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, authorizes $ 50 billion in borrowing over the next 26 months to close or merge 500 insolvent S & amp; Ls. Of that, $ 20 billion must be borrowed in the next eight weeks, before the end of the 1989 fiscal year. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials said $ 15 billion of this year's borrowing will be used to replace high-rate certificates of deposit at some of the 262 failed thrifts already under government control. The goal is to reduce operating losses until regulators can rescue the thrifts permanently. `` The effect ... may be quite significant,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief adviser on savings and loans. `` You're taking some of the institutions that have been rate leaders out of the marketplace. That will reduce pressure on all other institutions, both banks and thrifts, that have had to pay a premium to compete against these unhealthy firms.'' The remaining $ 5 billion raised this year will be used to either shut down or attract new owners to the thrifts in the worst financial trouble. The first of these deals could be announced as soon as this week. `` I think the process will begin very quickly,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is getting the job of managing the bailout. However, he said the frequency of rescues will be `` more measured'' than the frantic pace struck at the end of last year, when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> committed $ 16 billion in a two-day spending spree to rescue 75 institutions. The legislation, in addition to funding the bailout, imposes tough new financial standards on savings and loans and triggers the most sweeping overall changes in the regulatory bureaucracy in 50 years. Among many changes, the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a new agency headed by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, will be created to oversee the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s management of the bailout. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said an organizational meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> board is planned on the same day as the White House signing ceremony and that the board will appoint an executive director. Officials said the board likely will choose someone already within the government as a temporary director until a permanent appointment is made. The administration originally planned to borrow only $ 10 billion in fiscal year 1989, which ends Sept. 30. However, as part of a deal struck with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> just before final passage of the legislation, it agreed to raise $ 20 billion this year. That will balloon the 1989 deficit to near $ 170 billion, the highest in three years. The government will raise another $ 30 billion for rescues in 1990 and 1991, but as part of the compromise the administration will borrow that money through a new, quasi-private agency and the spending will not be counted in the deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it will borrow the first $ 5 billion on Thursday by auctioning 247-day cash management bills, which the government must be repay on April 19. In a related development, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> said it is taking over nine insolvent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, bring the total under government control to 262 in 33 states. Meanwhile, one of the first institutions taken over by regulators this year, <ORGANIZATION> Cartersville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, was sold to the <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> is investing $ 20 million for $ 56.9 million in assets. No government assistance is involved.

<HEAD>Agriculture Secretary Seeking End to Farm Export Subsidies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> is stepping up his call for a global agreement to end export subsidies for farm goods as the end of the current round of international trade talks looms. `` The economic case for reform can hardly be more compelling,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. `` The resistance is political.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators have been pushing the European Community in the current <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of trade talks to set a deadline for ending all practices that distort agricultural markets. Thus far the Europeans have declined. The negotiations, aimed at updating the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, have 18 months to run. `` The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> view seemingly is that such distortions should continue forever _ a most discouraging outlook indeed for the developing countries and for European consumers,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative before taking over at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> this year, is a longstanding critic of export subsidies. His remarks in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> contained a new barrage of choice rhetoric on the issue. He described the current system of subsidies under which governments pay farmers and exporters to slash prices and thus stimulate overseas sales as a game of `` fool's monopoly'' and said the place to `` put an end to this madness is the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also acknowledged in effect that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is often an active player in the subsidy game. `` Our European colleagues have said repeatedly that there are no angels in agriculture trade,'' he said. `` The question is, how do we get closer to heaven?'' He took aim at two lingering criticisms of the American position in the talks. `` There are some who say that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal is unrealistic _ that governments can not and should not get completely out of agriculture,'' he said. `` But that is not the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. proposal.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> reiterated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no complaint about financial supports for agriculture as long as they avoid distortion of global markets. `` We have called only for the elimination of trade-distorting measures over a period of time sufficient to allow farmers to adapt to the new environment.'' He also scoffed at the complaint that the negotiators have never agreed on a definition of which practices are `` trade distorting.'' `` We have 18 months, the final stage of the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION>, to decide that,'' he said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, however, left no doubt as to his view. `` Perhaps the most vivid example is grain,'' he said. `` Ten years ago the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> had net imports of nearly 20 million tons. Now the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> has net annual exports of about 30 million tons. Their stated goal was self sufficiency. But that goal was reached long ago.'' `` The Community now uses billions of European currency units to unload its surplus production on the world market, undercutting lower cost competitors. `` In contrast the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, most unwisely, has unilaterally disarmed itself by taking vast amounts of land out of production. That action has helped support prices everywhere, but the result has been a loss in market share.''

<HEAD>Iowa Uses 16-Inch Guns in Firing Exercise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The USS Iowa's test firing of its 16-inch guns marks their first use since an explosion killed 47 sailors in April, but a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman says the turret involved in the blast was not used. The test took place Friday without incident while the ship was deployed for the Mideastern hostage crisis, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Monday. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. <PERSON> Carlyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> had ordered a moratorium on the use of the weapons in all ships shortly after the incident April 19 in which 47 sailors were killed, but that decision was modified in June. Because fleet commanders need to respond to the possibility of war, attack, or other contingencies, the so-called `` live-fire training'' was permitted. `` The test was successful and without incident,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said guns from two of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s three turrets were used in the exercise. The No. 2 turret, the one involved in the April explosion, was not used, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has yet to release the results of its investigation into the explosion in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s No. 2 gun turret, one of the worst naval disasters since the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. The report has been submitted to the commander of surface forces for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and will eventually land on <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s desk after being passed up the chain of command. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was one of several ships dispatched to the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> as part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> show of military force ordered in response to the ongoing hostage crisis. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> to make a port call in <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, but cut short its visit to head closer to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last week. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the commander for the 6th fleet in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, Vice Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, authorized the test firing. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, aboard the guided missile cruiser USS Belknap, canceled a four-day call at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION> last week in order to oversee the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> movements in the area. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> refused to discuss the number of guns used in the exercise or the amount of explosives used to pack them. There are three guns on each of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s gun turrets. Each gun can fire projectiles weighing up to 2,700 pounds at a maximum range of 23 miles. It also has 12 5-inch guns. The battleship is also equipped with a variety of other weapons, including Tomahawk and Harpoon cruise missiles. The only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft carrier in the <ORGANIZATION> 6th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, the USS Coral Sea, also is in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, said a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. The aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, ordered from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> north </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> as part of the show-the-flag exercise, was scheduled to be on station today, the official added. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, in remarks to reporters on Monday, confirmed the positioning of the two carriers. Although the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was required to cross thousands of miles of ocean to reach its station, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> called the deployment `` not that unusual for us. `` We always have at least one carrier group in the Med ... There are various and sundry other forces available in that part of the world, as is normally the case,'' he added.

<HEAD>FAA Cancels Contract for New Landing Systems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government says it still plans to bring a new generation of landing systems to the nation's airports by the end of the century despite falling three years behind schedule and canceling the main contract. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Monday ended a $ 79 million contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to build 178 microwave landing systems and said it will ask for new contractors' proposals later this year. The company was chosen in 1984 to build systems that are to replace the instrument landing systems used for years at most airports. In a prepared statement, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said engineering and production problems at the <LOCATION> Commack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, - based company have delayed the program by three years But the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said it remains committed to putting the new microwave landing systems at major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports in 1998 and at all airports around 2000. <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> has delivered two of the systems sought in the contract. One has been installed at the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, airport. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said it will buy 26 systems from other sources, test that equipment and then decide whether to move ahead. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to award a new contract in 1991. <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION>, through its parent <ORGANIZATION> Emerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said it will sue over the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> decision. The microwave landing system is intended to give pilots greater flexibility in their landing approaches at airports and help airports increase their flight capacity. The system uses high-frequency microwaves to direct planes to landings, allowing them to make curved and steeper approaches outside the strict paths necessary under the current system. The system is virtually immune to weather hazards. In its letter to <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said the company has `` failed to perform and deliver in accordance with the schedule of the subject contract.'' But Hazeltine blamed the government for production delays, saying problems involving payments and timing of deliveries were the result of changes the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> made in the contract after it was awarded. The agency had planned on putting new microwave systems at the <LOCATION> Laconia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> airports in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said that because of the delays it may put early systems at high-profile, high-volume airports such as <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> plans to buy 750 of the new systems, if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> intelligence officer is under a judge's order not to discuss his complaints of waste and fraud in a secret plan for maintaining the government after a nuclear attack. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> issued the gag order against <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Westerman </PERSON> and his lawyer, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mroz </PERSON>, after their names appeared in a magazine article about the `` continuity of government'' program, according to government sources. The program is aimed at enabling the government to regroup in the event of a nuclear attack. <PERSON> Westerman </PERSON> owns a small firm that provided security services related to the program to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee investigator attempted to interview <PERSON> Westerman </PERSON> as a result of the article in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> News & amp; World Report, but was told the judge's order extended to conversations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the sources, who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> issued the order a week ago today. <PERSON> Westerman </PERSON> in March 1987 began alleging there were irregularities in the program, according to papers on file in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Court of Claims. <PERSON> Westerman </PERSON> has since been made a target of the investigation, which he claims is an effort at retaliation. Details of <PERSON> Westerman </PERSON>'s allegations are contained in a federal court suit that was placed under seal early this year because of the highly classified nature of the project. The project includes mobile communications systems and command-post bunkers around the country, according to the magazine. After <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s gag order last week, a computerized docket sheet at the federal courthouse was altered, so that case now is entitled merely `` Sealed v. Sealed.'' The docket previously had said that <PERSON> Westerman </PERSON> and his firm, <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, are suing the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, three federal agencies, a private corporation and an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> officer who oversaw his contract. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a federal grand jury are looking into the continuity of government program. The investigations reportedly focus on allegations that contracts were awarded improperly or that payments were made for work not properly done, resulting in millions of dollars in costs that may not be justified. On Christmas Eve 1987, after <PERSON> Westerman </PERSON> continued to make allegations to superiors, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> told him that his contract was not being renewed despite earlier assurances that it would be, according to papers he filed in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Court of Claims. He says he is still owed $ 500,000 in unreimbursed costs. <PERSON> Westerman </PERSON>, a retired major who spent 20 years as an Army counterintelligence officer, took his allegations to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the inspector general's office at the emergency management agency. In January, two months after filing his case with the claims court, he was informed that his contract was the focus of a criminal investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for possible fraud. He recently received a `` target'' letter from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> informing him he is the focus of that probe. His claims court case is suspended pending the outcome of the criminal investigation. `` I think there are certain individuals in the government who are using this process to ruin my client financially,'' <PERSON> Mroz </PERSON> said Monday after a hearing on the claims court case. <PERSON> Mroz </PERSON> said the individuals, whom he did not identify, are engaging in `` retribution ... in connection with certain allegations by my client about waste and fraud as well as their attempted cover-up of their own wrongdoing in the operation of his contract.'' <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said regarding the allegations of irregularities in the secret program, `` the appropriate authorities within the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the executive branch review -LRB- the program -RRB- regularly.''

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s troubled governing party on Tuesday overwhelmingly elected <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> to become party president and succeed Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> in a vote likely to influence the nation's future political balance. The 58-year-old <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, a two-time former education minister, is the party's second new leader in two months. Like Uno, he has little power base of his own and hopes to overcome scandals and a tax policy that loosened the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' grip on power for the first time since 1955. Party officials said <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> received 279 votes. <PERSON> Yoshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>, a former health and welfare minister, received 120 votes, while <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>, a novelist and former transportation minister from the party's nationalist wing, received 48, with four invalid votes out of the total of 451. Party members watched silently as six officials counted the ballots and placed them in separate black lacquer trays, but broke into applause when the winner was announced. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> rose from his seat and bowed. In an attempt at greater democracy, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> decided for the first time in 17 years to select the president by a vote of their <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members and 47 delegates from prefectural party organizations. The party president is expected to be confirmed as prime minister on Wednesday by the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, where the governing party has a large majority. In elections July 23, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lost their majority in the upper house for the first time since the party was formed 34 years ago. Meanwhile Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> officially opened a new session of Parliament on Tuesday, and called for the lawmakers to promote world peace and the nation's prosperity, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> stepped down as prime minister June 2 to take responsibility for the Recruit influence-buying scandal, which reached the top ranks of the governing party, bureaucracy and business. His successor, <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, was plagued by reports that he kept paid mistresses, and announced his resignation July 24 to take responsibility for the loss in upper-house elections. All three candidates to replace <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> agreed in speeches to party members Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> should revise an unpopular 3 percent sales tax that outraged Japanese housewives and contributed to the loss of the upper house. General elections for the lower house are expected before spring. `` The situation the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> now faces is the worst since its founding'' in 1955, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said in his speech, and declared: `` I believe the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>'s resurrection is the only way for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to maintain freedom, democracy, peace and affluence.'' He said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also should play a greater role in the world. `` It is not enough for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to simply maintain the security treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and not to play a more responsible role now that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has grown so powerful and economically affluent,'' he said. `` We are responsible for fulfilling the world's expectations of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> might be able to help President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform efforts in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and contribute to the opening of Eastern European countries. <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>, 56, said in his speech: `` Any further decline in the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s strength threatens <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s free enterprise system, which has enabled the people, through their efforts, to create the most dynamic economy in the world.'' Stressing the image problem, <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>, 62, said: `` Public anger toward the party has not calmed down even after our election defeat. There seem to be persistent distrust and anger among the people.''

<HEAD>New Japanese Leader Fulfills 29-Year-Old Pledge</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In 1960, a cocky 29-year-old politician predicted that in another 29 years he would be prime minister of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> made that prophecy reality Tuesday as he was voted to head the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, assuring him of becoming <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 19th postwar premier. A few weeks ago it seemed most unlikely. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> did n't figure in the early race to succeed <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who is stepping down after less than two months in the wake of his party's thrashing in recent parliamentary elections. But with senior party leaders virtually eliminated from serving in the nation's highest office because of their own links to an influence-peddling scandal, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> was called on as an experienced politician with a clean image to lead the party out of its current crisis. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> becomes prime minister because of the party's majority in the lower house of Parliament. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> is expected to be formally named on Wednesday. The party lost its majority in the upper house in an election last month, forcing Uno, already besieged by charges that he kept paid mistresses, to take responsibility for the setback and resign. `` We must overcome the obstacles, which I deeply regret,'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> told party members in a speech Monday. `` We must seriously consider the harsh reality of the election results.'' A veteran politician who served as education minister in the Cabinets of two prime ministers, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s second-youngest postwar leader. Only <PERSON> Kakuei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, premier in 1972-74, was younger, taking office at age 54. An eloquent speaker who studied debating in college, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> learned his political ropes as a protege of the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Miki </PERSON>, and was once considered a future party heavyweight. His influence waned, however, as the small intra-party faction to which he belonged became overshadowed by larger groupings within the party. The Liberal Democrats turned to him amid calls for a younger leadership, and because of his support for political reform, which he inherited from <PERSON> Miki </PERSON>. He was also a compromise candidate between the main rival factions, whose leaders were tainted by the so-called Recruit Co. scandal. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> himself has acknowledged receiving $ 108,000 in donations from Recruit, but has claimed they were all legitimate political contributions. He moved quickly to repair damage to the Liberal Democrats since formally declaring his candidacy on Friday, appealing particularly to women, who felt estranged by allegations about <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s affairs and a new consumption tax forced into law by the party earlier this year. `` We must think of constructing a social balance between men and women that respects women's place in society and makes use of their abilities,'' he said in his Monday speech. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s drawbacks are a lack of experience in foreign and financial affairs, not heading his own faction and never having served a top party post. Some political analysts therefore believe his administration will end in October when the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> elect a new party president for a two-year term. Others, however, believe <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> could last longer, depending on how he fares in the coming three months. `` If he succeeds in hammering out his own color and philosophy, there is a possibility his administration could last an unexpectedly long time,'' <ORGANIZATION> Gakushuin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Hidekazu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawai </PERSON> told the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> considers the number 29 particularly significant. Aside from his vow at age 29, he graduated from prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Waseda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the 29th year of the reign of the late Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, and was first elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 29th general election.

<HEAD>Shrimpers Must Now Limit Trawls To 105 Minutes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Environmentalists are threatening to take the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> back to court over Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s decision allowing shrimpers to abandon devices that protect endangered sea turtles in favor of regimented trawl times The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> and other conservation groups argue that the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> must uphold the law requiring shrimpers to equip their nets with turtle excluder devices, and that limited trawling is ineffective in protecting sea turtles such as the <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s ridley. Under a rule that took effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT today, shrimpers were to begin pulling their nets every 105 minutes to check for entangled sea turtles. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> predicted compliance with the limiting trawling times would be far better than with the turtle excluder devices that shrimpers loathe. But conservationists said only TEDs can save the <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s ridley from extinction before the end of the century.

 <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, the volatile <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> immigration chief who ignored orders to deport Nicaraguans but sent home Haitian boat people, announced his resignation. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, district <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> director since 1983, said Monday he would resign Aug. 21 to teach criminal justice at a small college in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Three years ago <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> refused to send back a group of Nicaraguan refugees and announed he was flouting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies that treated the Nicaraguans the same as other Central Americans, who have no special immigration status.

He said it was `` simply not true'' that under his term Haitians were discriminated against. `` I think it's dangerous and irresponsible to make statements about discrimination in a community as volatile as this.'' `` It's true that my relationship with Mr. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> has been up and down some days.

 <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> of the Irish rock group U2 has been charged with possession of marijuana. The 29-year-old bass guitarist, dressed all in black, appeared briefly in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday but under Irish law was not required to enter a plea. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> was arrested near his <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> home Sunday night and charged with possessing marijuana and with having the drug with the intent to supply someone else, police told the court. Judge <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Windle </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> to post bail of $ 710 and to return to court on Sept. 1. If convicted of possession of marijuana, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> faces a maximum fine of $ 1,420. Police said there is no fixed penalty for a conviction for possession of the drug with intent to supply, and the judge usually takes into account the circumstances of the arrest and the amount of drug involved. Det. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Garda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Siochana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force, told the court that when the first charge was read to him, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> replied: `` There was nothing found in my possession.'' <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> made no comment when the second charge was put to him, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> said. The musician stood with his hands clasped behind his back facing the judge as the detective gave his evidence. The British-born musician became an Irish citizen earlier this year.

 A chemical company's chief executive will answer questions about a toxic spill this week in a court case that environmentalists and legal experts say could set a precedent for punishing corporate negligence. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> twice has refused to accept pleas from officials representing <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Philadelphia-based chemical company charged with polluting a <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> waterway in a 1985 toxic bleach spill, and requested the appearance of chief executive and board Chairman <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>. `` Who is this corporation?'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> asked in a hearing earlier this year. `` I think the public is entitled to know who is responsible.'' <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> was to appear in court Wednesday, a company spokesman said. <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> has declined to comment on his appearance. The case is the first in which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government based its criminal investigation solely on corporate negligence, said prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. `` To my knowledge, this is the first case of a federal judge's ordering a particular individual from a corporate body to appear to plead the guilt of the corporate entity,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Skover </PERSON>, professor of civil procedure and constitutional law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Skover </PERSON> predicted <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>'s tactic will be used again, possibly in lawsuits against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> over the 11 million gallons of oil spilled in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has said that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is the subject of a criminal investigation because of the March spill, the nation's largest. `` The device used by <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> may prove very effective in alerting all corporations that the top executive will not be allowed to pass the buck,'' <PERSON> Skover </PERSON> said. Environmentalists agreed that corporate executives will take notice of the <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> case. `` How can you be a corporate executive and not take responsibility for your corporation?'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortman </PERSON> of the Northwest office of Friends of the Earth. `` We no longer accept the notion that corporations are faceless letterheads that ca n't be threatened or held accountable.'' The negligence charges in the case were aimed at corporate officers and employees as well as the company, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. `` Corporations are run by people who are responsible for what happens,'' he said. The only <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> employee to admit wrongdoing was <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> plant manager <PERSON> Orval </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. High. He received two years' probation and a $ 5,000 fine for negligently discharging pollutants and failing to notify the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. The case involved a spill of at least 75,000 gallons of a chemical containing sodium dichromate into <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>'s Hylebos Waterway, which flows into Puget Sound. The spill occurred when a 180,000-gallon storage tank ruptured. Sodium dichromate is a toxic compound used as a bleach in the paper industry. It contains hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing agent. Last year, a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> indicted the company and four company officers. On May 2, prosecutors and <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> lawyers reached a plea agreement, which called for the company to plead guilty to five misdemeanor counts and pay a $ 1.1 million fine. The agreement covered two counts of negligently failing to maintain adequate storage tanks at its <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> plant, two counts of discharging pollutants, and one count of failing to promptly report the spill to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Charges against the company officials, including three executives, were dropped. <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> was not charged. In May, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s attorneys appeared at <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>'s federal courthouse to plead guilty to the reduced charges. But <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> refused to accept their pleas and asked that corporate officers appear instead. In June, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> sent three corporate officers but <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> changed his mind. He asked to see <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> declined to comment on the company's reaction to <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>'s order except to say there was `` surprise.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> employs 135 people in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> and 170 at a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, plant. The <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> operation produces chemicals used in paper, adhesives and bleach. The company reported first-quarter earnings of $ 28.5 million this year, on sales of $ 279.9 million.

 A three-stage rocket carrying a weather satellite failed to lift off today when one of its three engines misfired during countdown at a space center in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, officials said. The $ 81 million H-1 rocket, capable of sending a 1,200-pound satellite into geostationary orbit, failed to lift off at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Tanegashima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 616 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> NASDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Junji </PERSON> <PERSON> Oda </PERSON>. It was the space agency's first failure in 20 rocket launchings since the agency successfully sent up the N-1 type rocket in 1975, <PERSON> Oda </PERSON> said. He said the reason for the mishap was unknown. `` We fired the first stage, but something happened before it reached the second stage and it was automatically stopped. At present we do n't know what it was,'' <PERSON> Oda </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kishiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said he will seek a prompt report on the cause of the failure. `` The accident happened at a time when we have just started to put more effort into space development. We have to be able to earn the public's understanding and trust in space development,'' <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> said. Before starting an investigation into the causes of the failure, the agency has to extract fuel and other materials from the rocket to avoid an explosion, <PERSON> Oda </PERSON> said. If the trouble is not too serious and can be fixed `` without too much effort,'' another trial could be possible by the end of September, he said. The H-1 rocket carries the No. 4 weather satellite, which will replace the current weather satellite known as `` Himawari No. 3,'' or `` Sunflower No. 3.'' The present satellite is capable of pursuing its mission for another year or so, according to Oda. The launch was originally scheduled for Aug. 1, but it was postponed twice by bad weather.

 A man battling his wife for custody of their fertilized eggs says he would rather leave the seven pre-embryos in cold storage than let them be born to a single parent. <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said after the first day of his unprecedented divorce trial Monday that he comes from a broken home and knows the hardships it can cause. `` I just simply do not wish to have any children out there for the fact it would be in a single-parent situation,'' he said. `` I do n't think it would be fair to me or the child.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who is fighting to have the seven pre-embryos implanted in her womb, said they represent her best chance at motherhood. `` I'm quite capable of raising a child by myself,'' she said. `` I do n't think he has to worry about that.'' Both <PERSON> Davises </PERSON> were to testify today in <ORGANIZATION> Blount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> before Judge <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 30, sued for divorce in February and asked the court to prevent his wife from having any of the eggs implanted. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 28, says she has the greater claim to the eggs because she went to more trouble to produce them and potentially can do more for them. The <PERSON> Davises </PERSON> were married nine years ago and entered the in vitro fertilization program at a <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> hospital three years later after Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had four tubal pregnancies. In vitro fertilization first was used successfully in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1978. It involves fertilization of eggs in a laboratory dish. The fertilized eggs can be implanted in a womb and brought to term naturally. The success rate, according to testimony Monday, is about 18 percent nationwide. There originally were nine fertilized eggs; two were unsuccessfully implanted before the couple's marriage broke down. Dr. <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who runs the in vitro fertilization program, testified Monday the seven pre-embryos are between four and eight cells. A pre-embryo is an egg that has been fertilized for less then 12 to 14 days. Other testimony Monday described pre-embryos as a mass of undifferentiated cells with no human characteristics. But King testified the pre-embryos represent potential life. He said they should not be destroyed, whatever the outcome of the divorce suit, but provided to some other infertile couple. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Christenberry </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' attorney, said in his opening statement, `` The question of how we classify the embryos is vital.'' `` I think it's important we recognize these are living cells,'' he said. `` They may or may not develop, but ... we believe they deserve protection.'' <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> `` wants to leave the status quo in effect. He does n't plan to alter the pre-embryos, but he does ask that any use of them require his consent.'' <PERSON> Christenberry </PERSON> has tried to show that Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> might not have another chance to go through in vitro fertilization, which produces so-called `` test-tube babies'' because the actual fertilization takes place outside the womb in a laboratory dish. But both King and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> law professor called by <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> as an expert witness, said she probably could go through the process again. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he believes there are some in vitro programs that would accept a single woman as a client; or, he said, she might remarry.

 <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, mother of seven litters and beloved golden retriever of <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON>, is missing, the victim of what looks like a political dognapping. It started as nothing more than a lost dog story. But <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s disappearance turned sinister after 12 hours when a man telephoned Mrs. <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON>'s home and said: `` Get off the council and you'll get your dog.'' Monday, one week after <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s disappearance, Mrs. <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON> calmly retold the mysterious story, weary from grief-stricken appeals on radio and television and a week of sleepless nights. Ginger and <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s daughter and former mate, respectively, are upset, Mrs. <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON> said. `` The entire family is devastated. We have n't been right for a week,'' she said. It all began the night of July 31. That was the last time anybody saw <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. The 7-year-old canine had been let out for her nightly cavort with Ginger to range over the <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON>'s 64 acres in this community of chicken and dairy farms and plantations of sod for suburban lawns. At 9:15 p.m. Ginger came home _ alone. Mrs. <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON>, a Republican housewife and lifelong resident of this town of 6,700, 45 miles south of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, said the apparent dognapping is the work of a sick mind rather than a political foe. Rumors have sprung up nevertheless. The 48-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON> entered politics five years ago by running for the five-member town council. She quickly moved to the top to become the first woman chief executive in this town, incorporated in 1757. `` I should n't have any enemies,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON> said, cradling one of <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s latest puppies from a litter of nine. But it has been widely speculated that Mrs. <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON>'s missing dog is somehow related to the controversial firing last November of the town dump custodian and the highway supervisor. The latter was later reinstated, then resigned. Mrs. <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON> refused to comment about this, saying only that her vote for dismissal was just one of five unanimous votes and that the matter is the subject of a court suit over alleged mismanagement of town property. `` I'm not pointing the finger at anybody,'' she said. Others disagreed. The general feeling around town, said <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, temporary town clerk, is `` it's a personal vendetta against this woman.'' And Police Chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeden </PERSON> has speculated the apparent dognapping had something to do with `` hard feelings from somewhere in the past.'' <PERSON> Weeden </PERSON> said Monday that he has no suspects but lots of tips. `` It's an important case to us,'' he said. `` It's sensitive. It's a family pet.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON>'s fondness for her dogs is well known. A framed family portrait of <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, Ginger and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> adorns the kitchen of the Johansons' 18th-century farmhouse. The dogs regularly play ball on the beach, Mrs. <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON> said. `` They go get the newspapers on Sunday mornings. They go shopping, they go visiting with us.'' There is a reward for <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s return, but Mrs. <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON> wo n't say how much `` How can you put a price tag on someone who is part of your family?'' The Johansons held a family powwow to decide whether Mrs. <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON> should quit for the sake of <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s return. For now at least, they decided against abdicating, dog or no dog. `` If I resign, if somebody gets their way on one thing, what's next I am not leaving the council at this time,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts from the `` Declaration of <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>'' signed Monday in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, which calls for the disbanding of the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels, as translated from Spanish by The Associated Press: The five Central American presidents declared that it `` is necessary to complete the steps agreed upon in <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> II -LRB- <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, 1987 -RRB- to reach a strong and lasting peace, such as putting into effect the compliance of the promises made by the presidents in the declarations and agreements that have been achieved successively in <LOCATION> Alajuela </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, 1988 -RRB- and Costa del Sol -LRB- <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, 1989 -RRB-.'' As a result, the presidents pledged `` to prevent the use of each country's territory to destabilize governments in other Central American countries ...'' They agreed `` to demobilize, repatriate or voluntarily relocate to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or third countries members of the Nicaraguan resistance and their families.'' Similarly, they supported an accord reached Monday by `` <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> under which <PERSON> Nicargua </PERSON> agreed to withdraw a lawsuit before the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>'' accusing <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> of supporting the Contra rebels. The presidents of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> declared their `` moral support'' of this agreement. The presidents then agreed to `` ratify the demand of armed groups in the region, especially the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas fighting the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> -RRB-, currently in conflict, to desist from these actions ... cease hostilities immediately, and engage in a dialogue to abandon their armed struggle.'' The presidents called for `` the incorporation of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> into the democratic life'' of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` The presidents recognize the efforts of the Guatemalan government to strengthen its process of national reconciliation through dialogue, in which the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has a strong presence.'' The presidents added: `` We reiterate the call for armed groups to abandon their hostile actions within the spirit of this agreeement and incorporate themselves into institutional politics through the process of national reconciliation.'' The presidents also agreed `` to solicit the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to adopt the necessary measures to put into effect the mechanism of verification in terms of security in that <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> have arrived at an agreement that includes the withdrawal -LRB- of the Contras -RRB- from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> ... and reiterate our request for the establishment of an international peace keeping force.'' The presidents finally declared they `` condemn energetically the trafficking and use of drugs.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> condemned the arrest of three Cuban human rights activists, and a rights group said the detentions confirmed <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s status as one of the world's `` most rigidly totalitarian states.'' <PERSON> Elizardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested early Sunday when about 20 security policemen showed up at his home soon after 5 a.m., his wife <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Hiram </PERSON> <PERSON> Abi </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobas </PERSON>, acting head of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cuba </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> rights, also were arrested, according to <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cernuda </PERSON>, a Cuban exile and book publisher here.

Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> released a statement condemning the arrest as a `` flagarant human rights violation.'' `` We hope concerned members of the international community, including the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, will join us in condemning not only <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>' arrest, but also the continued imprisonment of other prominent human rights leaders,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman.

<HEAD>New Prime Minister-Designate says Anti-Nuclear Policy to Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The man elected today to succeed outgoing Prime Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said he intends to maintain a tough anti-nuclear decree that bans <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> ports. `` Our nuclear policy wo n't be changed,'' Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> told a news conference after being named head of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, 47, resigned Monday amid party wrangling over economic policy, citing health reasons. `` We want to have dialogue with the Americans, we want to have discussions, but I would n't want to suggest that there is going to be any prospect of immediate change in that respect at all,'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that it hoped the next prime minister would reassess the policy that led to the the collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> ANZUS </ORGANIZATION> military alliance with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> arranged to visit Gov.-General Sir <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> today to formally submit his resignation. Upon acceptance of the resignation, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> was to formally become prime minister. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, 40, who was health minister, will become deputy prime minister. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, 47, former attorney-general and justice minister, was elected leader of the traditionally left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at a meeting of the party's caucus following <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'s sudden announcement that he was resigning after five years. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said he wanted to step down while he was still on top. He suffered a heart attack a year ago. He noted recent opinion polls show his personal popularity and that of his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government are increasing. But observers pointed to party infighting over the economy and last week's reappointment to the Cabinet of <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, a conservative archrival of <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> who <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> dismissed as finance minister last year. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'s government denied permission for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to enter <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> ports in 1984 because <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> refused to confirm or deny whether specific ships carried atomic weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986 retaliated by suspending all military cooperation with the government in <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>, making it impossible to operate the Australian-New Zealand-U.S. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ANZUS </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- defense alliance. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Monday: `` We are hopeful ... that Prime Minister <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'s successor will reassess <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s anti-nuclear policy. `` We hope he will address with us the differences between our two countries on security-related issues,'' he said. There was no immediate reaction to <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'s resignation from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which was embroiled in a major diplomatic row with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> after French agents in 1985 bombed the environmentalist ship Rainbow Warrior in <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION> harbor, causing the death of a Dutch photographer. Last year <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> allowed <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> to deregulate industries, remove subsidies and privatize government departments. But he opposed <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' proposed flat tax among other ideas, saying it would hit the poor hardest. `` There is no place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> for deregulated labor markets. There is no place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> for doing away with a minimum wage,'' <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said. `` There is no place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> for policies which would reduce women to some convenient chattels of the marketplace.''

 Authorities shut down a day care service while they investigate the death of a 3-year-old girl who was left in a closed car for more than three hours on a sweltering afternoon. <PERSON> Ebony </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was left alone in a late-model <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> with its windows rolled up from 12:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. Friday, police Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulhall </PERSON> said. The car was parked in the driveway of the day care operator's home, which is where the business is located. The girl was one of seven children between the ages of 3 and 6 who had returned from a brief shopping trip with the day care operator, <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>. `` It's possible she fell asleep and was quiet in the back,'' <PERSON> Mulhall </PERSON> said. The other children and their parents were being questioned. Temperatures were as high as 94 on Friday, while the humidity was oppressive. Medical experts said under those conditions a child can begin dehydrating in 30 minutes. The state medical examiner's office said <PERSON> Ebony </PERSON> died of hyperthermia, a condition in which a person loses the ability to sweat and thereby control body temperature. <PERSON> Mulhall </PERSON> said the car's windows were closed because its air conditioning had been used during the trip to a nearby shopping plaza. No charges had been filed against <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, 57, who runs a state-licensed day care business from her home. <PERSON> Mulhall </PERSON> said he expected charges to be filed once the police investigation was completed. <PERSON> Mulhall </PERSON> said <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> was `` very emotional and in a state of shock'' on Monday. <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> did n't return a telephone call to her home Monday. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolly </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, said the state temporarily suspended the license of the day care service pending the investigation.

<HEAD>Medicaid, Prison Spending Continue to Grow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON JENKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Spending on prisons and Medicaid are the fastest growing items in state budgets across the country, while increases for education and welfare are lagging, a study shows. Education still gets the lion's share of state funds, but the percentage increase in 1989 was far below that of corrections and Medicaid, according to a survey by the fiscal staff of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION>. The survey also found that 30 states increased taxes this year, and that states built their reserves to the highest level in nine years. The survey was released Monday at the conference's summer meeting in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, which is being attended by more than 5,000 people, mainly legislators and state officials and staff. Spending on prisons rose by 14.1 percent among the states as a whole, while the increase in Medicaid costs was 10.4 percent. Education, considered the No. 1 issue in most states, got little more than the average increase in overall spending. Elementary-secondary education spending rose by 7.8 percent, while funding for colleges and universities jumped 7.3 percent. The overall increase in spending was 7.2 percent _ up from 6.6 percent a year ago. Spending on Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the basic welfare program, rose just 4.4 percent. Education makes up more than 50 percent of state budgets across the country. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, which had to pump money into teacher retirement and health insurance, led the states with a 25.7 percent increase in education funding. Next were <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> with a 17.7 percent increase followed by <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> with 16.8 percent, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> with 15.2 percent and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> with 14.7 percent. The report showed states have an estimated $ 10.9 billion in reserves _ or 4.4 percent of general funds. That's the highest level since 1980, when reserves totaled $ 11.8 billion. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, director of fiscal affairs for the conference, said most states are `` comfortable'' from a financial standpoint. But he added that `` the margin that is protecting them from being uncomfortable is not so large.'' The organization's president, <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tempore <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said experience has shown that states' financial conditions can change rapidly and often are tied to the national economy `` The greatest concentration of fiscal problems this year was in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, places that just two years ago were faring better than most states.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, the group's president-elect and minority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, noted that the recession of the early 1980s put many states in financial difficulties. `` The current fiscal health is certainly not a cause for complacency,'' he said. <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> said 1989 was `` an active year for state tax policy,'' with tax increases totaling $ 3.5 billion in 30 states. Spending on prisons has jumped at a time when crime rates are dropping in many areas. Gold attributed the increase to court-ordered prison improvements and tougher sentencing guidelines. <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> said the economic future of states is clouded by large trade and federal budget deficits and uncertainty about federal aid and federal mandates on various programs. He said federal initiatives in welfare reform, catastrophic health care and nursing home legislation will raise state costs by more than $ 2 billion a year.

 Family and friends of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> awaited word today on the fate of the congressman, who was on a plane that failed to arrive as expected at a refugee camp near the Ethiopian-Sudanese border. `` I think that he's going to be all right. Really, I do,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Rains </PERSON> said Monday night. `` And I know I have to have courage, because I want to give courage to the children.'' The plane carried nine Americans and five Ethiopians. The Americans included members of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s staff and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> personnel. <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>, a spokeswoman in <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, said Monday it was `` too early to raise alarms'' despite information from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that the plane was reported overdue on a flight from the Ethiopian capitol of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> to the refugee camp, <PERSON> Fugnido </PERSON>, about 300 miles to the southwest. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shub </PERSON> said, however, `` We are concerned about the welfare of Mr. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and his group.'' Ms. <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> said she is not overly concerned because communications are poor and the travelers would not be able to notify anyone of a change in plans. `` My guess is once en route, the camp that was the original destination was too far and they opted to go to a different camp,'' Ms. <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> said. She said the plane was late in departing Monday from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> because of bad weather. Ms. <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> said pilots were strict about adhering to a 5 p.m. curfew to return to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. `` If they feel they ca n't get back by that time, then you stay where you are overnight,'' she said. The 44-year-old <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger. He has taken a strong interest in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s refugees and visited the same area in March, officials said. The six-term congressman is married and has a son. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, who also serves on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and was twice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, often has served as a mediator in matters of international or interracial consequence. For 10 years, he has overseen a program in which black youths from his urban district were sent to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for six-week stays. He joined two other congressmen last October in a trip to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in efforts to negotiate the release of five political prisoners and their families. When members of the Veterans' Peace Convoy to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> were stopped at their approach to the International Bridge in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> in June 1988, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials in an effort to allow the group's passage across the border.

<HEAD>Government Says New Indictment Against Milken By October</HEAD>

 A grand jury investigation into former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is expected to deliver a new indictment by October, the government said. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> already has been charged with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud but a long-awaited superseding indictment in the landmark Wall Street corruption case could contain new charges. At a hearing Monday in federal court, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said the government has `` an ongoing investigation of many transactions.'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kimba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> the government was targeting Oct. 1 to file an indictment against <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, his brother, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, and former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>. The government disclosed its intent to file a new indictment, superceding one handed up March 29, after <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> accused prosecutors of issuing an `` indictment in installments'' that had hamstrung defense work. `` We can not really prepare this case when we only have part of an indictment,'' <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> said before requesting a timetable for `` the indictment we will go to trial on.'' The standing indictment charges the three defendants with racketeering, mail, wire and securities fraud. In the broadest use yet of federal racketeering laws, they face lengthy jail terms and billions of dollars in fines and forfeitures if convicted. A jury trial tentatively is set for March 1, 1990. An indictment replacing the original one has been anticipated for about two months by defense lawyers who are anxious to see what if any new charges the government brings against <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. Pressing for and getting the target date should allow defense lawyers to focus their preparations. Wood on Monday also ordered the government to be more specific about charges and statements made in the original 110-page indictment. The move came after defense lawyers charged the government with refusing to answer more than 130 requests for more information. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> ordered the government to identify unindicted co-conspirators named in the charges; identify unnamed people who allegedly participated in some of the cited transactions; and identify by category alleged victims and kinds of property allegedly defrauded. Prosecutors said they would produce within one month the bulk of the thousands of documents about transactions in the case that defense lawyers have demanded. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Flumenbaum </PERSON>, another <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> lawyer, accused the government of delaying release of critical documents. The <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> have pleaded innocent. <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> was one of six defendants recently convicted in the <LOCATION> Princeton-Newport </LOCATION> securities fraud trial and many of the transactions in that case are included in the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> indictment. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, 42, has set aside about $ 700 million in assets as part of a bond package and is free pending trial. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, widely credited with reshaping <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> finance through the use of high-yield, high-risk bonds, resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year to form an investment consulting firm.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index rebounded today after four days of decline, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar edged down against the Japanese yen after a three-day climb. The dollar closed at 139.25 yen, down 0.53 yen from Monday's 139.78-yen finish It opened at 139.55 yen and moved between 138.95 yen and 139.65 yen. The dollar had gained 3.58 yen in three trading days before today's decline. Currency trading today was marked mainly by participants' position adjustments, said <PERSON> Shinzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> News last Friday of a lower-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobless rate in July had contributed to the dollar's rise. But <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> said most market players were wary about buying too many dollars because `` the jobless rate, which is only one of many indicators, is not enough to determine the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy has started to grow again.'' A trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said the dollar edged down against the yen as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currrency was sold in dealings between the dollar and the West German mark. Most of today's dealings were among banks, with individual investors remaining on the sidelines, said the trader, speaking on condition of anonymity. On the stock exchange, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> climbed 129.10 points, or 0.37 percent, and closed at 34,759.48. The index had lost 111.61 points the previous day. <PERSON> Genjiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasaki </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said that after losing nearly 270 points since last Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> rebounded because of speculative investors' buying spot issues and selling futures issues to make profits from price gaps between the two markets. `` The new prime minister was finally chosen, and it reassured the market that there is less political uncertainty,'' he added. Today, the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chose <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, a former education minister, as the party's new president. He thus will become prime minister, succeeding <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who resigned to take responsibility for the party's losses in the July 23 parliamentary election. `` Many participants were still reluctant to buy because they do n't want to lose money in case the index plunges due to a possible major political change,'' <PERSON> Sasaki </PERSON> said. He noted first section volume was still small, estimated at 450 million shares, up from the previous day's 300 million. Traders reported many buy orders for <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> stock, which closed at a limit high of 16,400 yen -LRB- $ 118 -RRB- after the company announced a gratis share offering today. The interest in <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> also triggered buying of <LOCATION> Fanac </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> issues, <PERSON> Sasaki </PERSON> added.

 A fire closed a section of one of the nation's busiest highway interchanges and officials tried to persuade motorists to take mass transit instead of their vehicles to work. `` The rest of the week is going to be a disaster,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawler </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's going to take a while for people to find the best alternative route for them, and it's going to take a while for them to be convinced to take mass transit. The fire that closed Interstate 78 started at about 1:30 a.m. Monday at a garbage dump owned by <ORGANIZATION> Hub </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recycling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> underneath the 12-lane, elevated roadway, buckling steel beams. Late Monday, the fire was contained but continued to smolder. A 1 \ - mile portion of the 62.2-mile roadway, which handles about 100,000 vehicles a day, will probably be closed for months, Alternate routes linking the busy <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> suburbs and parts of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> are limited. New Jersey Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said a special panel has been convened to study other routes. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said the state was preparing to go to court to press for a cleanup of the site. A <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> clerk said a hearing could be held today. The state has been trying for two years to get the court to force Hub Recycling to remove rubbish stored under the interstate. An <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> judge last May ordered the removal of the garbage but stayed the decision on appeal from the company. Two of Hub Recycling's owners, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassi </PERSON>, were convicted recently of illegal waste handling in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION>, the state said. <PERSON> Harvan </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bassi </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION>, were partners in <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON>, which authorities said took part in a conspiracy to dump thousands of tons of construction debris at several <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> sites. Attempts to reach the two men were unsuccessful Monday. Their home telephone numbers could not be obtained. Their lawyer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, did not respond to messages left with his office. No injuries were reported in the blaze, which occurred about two miles from downtown <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. Officials were uncertain how the fire Some businesses in the area evacuated workers when smoke poured through cracks of up to eight inches in the highway. Environmental officials tested for toxic materials in the plume. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Baish </PERSON>, area director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, said he evacuated his workers about midday after smoke filled several floors housing his agency. He said some workers were coughing and complained of eye irritations. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> also closed its <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> office, and moved operations to its <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> bureau as a precaution, said <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>.

<HEAD>`Dialogue of the Deaf' Ending; New Era in War on Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The `` dialogue of the deaf'' that has at times afflicted <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appears to be giving way to a new era of understanding on issues from drug trafficking to debt. `` The relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has changed a lot in the last year,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said Monday. `` It is a new relationship of coordination, of collaboration.'' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, who pledged to eradicate drug production in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, spoke at the end of a day of talks that featured an unusually high-level <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation headed by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and four other Cabinet members. The talks produced no major accords but served to lay the groundwork for a <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at the beginning of October and the new mood of cooperation. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no more important relationship than with its neighbor and friend, the Republic of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. These are not mere words _ they represent the solemn commitment of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> praised the new Mexican administration's vigor in the war on drugs, saying it had made clear `` it wants to tear the roots of the opium poppy and marijuana plant from its soil.'' `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s success over the past six months in capturing and prosecuting drug traffickers has seized the world's attention,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has been a principal source of heroin and marijuana and a transit point for U.S.-bound cocaine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said corruption in the Mexican government prevented aggressive pursuit of traffickers. A former Mexican police officer was convicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year in the 1985 torture-slaying of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>. Another Mexican policeman was indicted in the case last month. Mexican officials have long insisted that cutting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand is the key to the problem. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` knows all too well that 60 percent of the world's illegal drug supply is consumed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` This senseless demand must be cut through the efforts of all Americans.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognition that it must cut the demand for drugs is vital to the new spirit of cooperation, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Solana </PERSON> said. Officials on both sides noted the positive new tone after years of misunderstanding, disagreement and mutual recrimination that a high-ranking <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> administration official described as at times having been a `` dialogue of the deaf.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> praised the economic policies of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, whose administration has been in office eight months. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> hailed the debt reduction agreement <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> reached with commercial banks two weeks ago and the steps it has taken to encourage foreign investment and lower trade barriers. Payments on the country's $ 107 billion foreign debt have contributed to a sharp decline in living standards the past seven years. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has become an economic model for other debtor nations because of <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' `` bold far-sighted policies.'' After two decades of 6 percent growth, the economy completely stagnated under <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' predecessor, President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, in part due to an austerity program put into effect to keep up with debt payments. But despite efforts to encourage non-petroleum exports, reduce government deficit spending and cut inflation, the economy has remained in the doldrums. Combined unemployment and underemployment is estimated at 40 percent. Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials joining <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> for the talks under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Binational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> included Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Session </PERSON>. Also on the agenda were issues relating to the U.S.-Mexican border, the environment, fisheries, trade and investment and cultural ties.

<HEAD>cuban Newspaper Says U.S. Refuses to Cooperate in Anti-Drug Effort</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is refusing to work with the <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> government in fighting drug trafficking. The newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION>, said in an editorial Monday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s communist government to change before there is talk of cooperation. `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> can not pretend that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> stop being what it is as a condition for any progress in their relations, even to agree on mechanisms for cooperation in the anti-drug struggle,'' <PERSON> Granma </PERSON> said. The editorial, headlined `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> must be treated as it is: a socialist and sovereign country,'' was carried in full by the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> and monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. As long as there is n't a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government `` with common sense and political courage to understand that it can not aspire to change us, there will not be bilateral progress,'' the editorial said. During the trials in recent weeks of 14 military officers accused of shipping Colombian cocaine and other drugs through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials and <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION> articles accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government of failing to share intelligence it had on drug trafficking. `` What is certain is that by denying that cooperation on information, six tons of cocaine entered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory, the equivalent of 4 million doses, although this represents less than 1 percent of annual consumption in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the editorial said. But it said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> set an example in its prosecution of the officers, four of whom were executed by firing squad in July. `` The reality is that no country in this hemisphere has fought as energetically against drugs as ours,'' it said. `` For many years <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has fought by itself against the traffickers marauding its coasts.'' The editorial compared <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s punishment of the 14 officers with the `` scandalously benign sentence imposed on <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>.'' North, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, was fined $ 150,000 and sentenced to two years' probation and 1,200 hours of community service for his role in the the Iran-Contra affair He was convicted of accepting an illegal gift, abetting in the obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and shredding official documents. `` We have lived 30 years without relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the editorial said. If there's anyone who is n't desperate to normalize relations, it's <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> came to power after the rightist government of <PERSON> Fulgencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Batista </PERSON> was overthrown in 1959.

 Five military astronauts boarded the space shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> today and prepared to fly on a secret mission to deploy a high-tech satellite to spy on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The weather was perfect and there were no technical problems as a blacked-out countdown advanced toward a liftoff expected about 8 a.m. Because most details about the flight are classified, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> would allow <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to announce only that liftoff would occur between 7:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. The countdown was to be made public just nine minutes before the planned liftoff. A van carrying the astronauts, accompanied by security cars and a hovering helicopter, arrived at the launch pad shortly after 5 a.m. The flight will be the first for <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> in 3 -LCB- years. During the hiatus, the craft has received 258 safety modifications dictated by the 1986 Challenger explosion. The ship's return to space will give the space agency a fleet of three orbiters to handle an increasing flight schedule. Three more flights are planned this year and nine in 1990. The commander is <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, a veteran of two earlier missions. The others are <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON>, who flew once previously on a shuttle. Although mission details are classified, sources close to the program said the astronauts will deploy a sophisticated 10-ton reconnaissance satellite to gather intelligence information over a wide area of the globe, including much of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The satellite is designed to take highly detailed photographs of troop movements, military installations and other targets of interest. The sources said that in the shuttle's cargo bay was a package of scientific instruments for military research, possibly for the `` Star Wars'' missile defense project. What the astronauts do will not be reported by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> or the Pentagon. A blackout was to be imposed throughout the flight, and only three brief announcements were planned to report on the health of the shuttle and to reveal when it will land at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The mission is expected to last five days. The flight is the eighth for <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the oldest of the shuttles, but its first since it flew the last mission before the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion. After the accident, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> concentrated on modifying the newer orbiters, <ORGANIZATION> Discovery </ORGANIZATION> and Atlantis, and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> spent much of the past few years as a `` hangar queen,'' stripped to provide spare parts for its sister ships. Discovery and Atlantis each have made two trips into space since post-Challenger flights resumed last September. During the flight, the astronauts were to check out 258 modifications made to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to improve safety and reliability as a result of the accident. The flight is the 30th for the shuttle program and the fourth dedicated solely to a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> mission. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had planned at least 13 more military launches from the shuttle through the 1990s, but, in the wake of the Challenger accident cut that number to seven, shifting several payloads to unmanned rockets to get away from reliance on a single launch vehicle. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contends the secrecy of the shuttle military flights is necessary to make it more difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast to monitor the flight and know its purpose. Critics argue that the secrecy is unnecessary because the Soviets, with their intelligence capabilities, undoubtedly already know a great deal about <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s mission, and that once the satellite is in orbit, the Russians will be able to track them precisely and know what they are doing.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar eased in calm European trading this morning and currency dealers said they expected it to settle into a narrow trading range and wait for clues about the direction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates. Gold prices rose. Traders in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, said the dollar is coming back down `` to reality'' after rising on Friday's better-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment figures. They said the dollar's rise had been magnified by the thin August holiday market. `` The dollar would n't have reacted as much in a normal market,'' one trader said. `` It's a very sensitive market that tends to accentuate even the slightest impulses.'' Added a trader at a commercial bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>: `` What goes up must come down. Nobody knows what they should think. People are changing opinions faster than they're changing clothes.'' Others predicted dollar activity might pick up later this week with the release of the July <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer price index and retail sales figures. `` By now we've seen this market is almost exclusively interest rate oriented,'' one trader said. `` It is hungry for news that can confirm what the employment data suggested.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.53 yen to a closing 139.25 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was also quoted at 139.25 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday: _ 1.9035 West German marks, down from 1.9055 _ 1.6375 Swiss francs, down from 1.6380 _ 6.4403 French francs, down from 6.4470 _ 2.1493 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1502 _ 1,369.50 Italian lire, down from 1,373.50 _ 1.1722 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1745 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 1 It cost $ 1.6175 to buy one pound, compared with $ 1.6075 late Monday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 366.10 a troy ounce, compared with late Monday's $ 365.75.

<HEAD>Canadian Air Brings Chill from Plains to Appalachians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A Canadian air mass chilled much of the nation's midsection this morning, pushing temperatures to record lows from the southern Plains to the Appalachians. Elsewhere this morning, showers and thunderstorms continued over south-central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, across the central Gulf Coast and over portions of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Showers also were over eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and rain was falling over much of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Thunderstorms dissipated over the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> but continued late Monday evening across <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and portions of the <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. Strong winds caused dust storms in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, reducing visibility to a quarter of a mile in the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, and heavy rain slowed traffic near <LOCATION> Parker </LOCATION>. A high pressure area extending from southern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to central <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> sent early morning temperatures plunging into the 40s in parts of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and the central Appalachians and into the 50s in parts of the <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and Southeast states. By early morning, at least 15 cities had set new record lows for the date. They included <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where a reading of 51 degrees broke by one degree a mark set in 1886; <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, where the thermometer hit 46 degrees; <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, with 58 degrees; and <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, with 66 degrees. More than three dozen cities set record lows on Monday. Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms from south-central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and some scattered thunderstorms over the <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, and the Plateau region west of the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>. A few showers also were predicted for western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Highs were expected to be in the 60s over <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>; the 90s from southern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, in south-central and southwest <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and across much of the intermountain region; between 100 and 108 degrees in the <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>; and in the 70s and 80s elsewhere.

<TEXT>
 In all of 1985, a single Cuban refugee was picked up in the sea passage separating the island nation from the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. So far this year, 117 refugees have made the perilous journey to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> shores and several officials see no signs the latest wave will abate as economic problems and political turmoil rattle <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Thousands of other Cubans arrive each year at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with forged passports or travel documents obtained in other Latin countries, such as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. `` It's been the year of the Cuban refugee in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> director in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` This is the most we've seen in at least the past five years. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> reports that 59 Cubans were found at sea last year and 44 were picked up in 1987. Many of the Cubans make the journey across the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> in small boats or makeshift vessels, such as inner tubes or rafts. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said some are washed overboard in rough seas or die of dehydration or hunger. Three Cubans who were picked up by a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> spy ship about 26 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> last month said they survived by catching a sea bird and eating it raw. They said a fourth companion became delirious during the six-day voyage and plunged overboard. `` There is no telling now many die trying to reach <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, who announced his resignation on Monday after six years on the job. Under federal immigration law, Cuban refugees with close relatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are released in their custody following interviews with <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials. Cubans with no ties are placed in <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> custody while asylum applications are processed, said <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>. Since Cubans can not be deported to their homeland under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, most are granted legal status, said <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>. In 1980, nearly 125,000 Cubans entered <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in the Mariel boatlift. Many of the newcomers were forced to camp under highways and in vacant lots because few shelters were available. The latest surge of Cuban refugees began only weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> responded to a record influx of Haitians traveling to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> shores in overcrowded boats. In March, nearly 1,500 Haitians were stopped at sea, more than any other month in an eight-year interdiction program which permits the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to return Haitians to their homeland after <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> interviews at sea. So far this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has returned more than 2,600 Haitians. Only five of the more than 20,000 Haitians interviewed at sea since 1981 have been brought into the country for political asylum hearings, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> reports. The others were deemed economic refugees and returned to <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>.

 The state's high court disbarred a woman who impersonated her husband and passed the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> bar exam in his name. In a 6-1 unsigned ruling Monday, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said it held `` sympathetic feelings'' for <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, who was pregnant when she took the test for her husband and said she took it out of fear he would abuse her. Dissenting Justice <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said the court had overreacted and imposed a punishment far harsher than the penalties it has given to several lawyers convicted of dealing drugs and misusing clients' money. Mrs. <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> was `` on the verge of complete physical, mental and emotional collapse'' when she took the test, <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said a period of suspension would be enough to protect the public. The ruling allows Mrs. <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, now 33 and a legal secretary in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, to reapply for admission to the bar in 1993, five years after she voluntarily went on inactive status. Her attorney, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON>, said he would urge her to ask the bar's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> for permission to reapply two years earlier Mrs. <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> passed the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> bar in 1983 and became a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Her husband, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lamb </ORGANIZATION>, failed the exam in February 1985. For the July 1985 exam, the bar said, Mrs. <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> cut her hair, dressed in men's clothes, had a bar identification photo taken, signed her husband's name and deliberately smudged her thumbprint. She took the exam a month later and passed with the ninth highest score in the state. After an anonymous tip to the bar led to an investigation, Mrs. <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> pleaded no contest to charges involving deception and impersonation, and was fined $ 2,500, ordered to perform 200 hours of community service and placed on probation. At the time, Mrs. <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, a diabetic, was in the late stages of a difficult pregnancy. She said her husband had become violent, smashing lamps, screaming at her and pushing her, and threatening to kill her and the fetus. <PERSON> Low </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> left his wife after the baby was born and they have since divorced.

 The governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> today elected <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> party president and successor to Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> in the hopes of putting behind it a bribery and sex scandal and an unpopular sales tax. The next prime minister called on fellow Japanese to give his scandal-plagued party a chance to `` carry out political reforms and shed our old skin.'' As expected, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, 58, was elected to head the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, defeating late challenges by <PERSON> Yoshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>, a former welfare minister, and <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>, a novelist and former transport minister. A secret ballot by the conservative party's 404 members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and one delegate from each of the party's 47 state branches resulted in 279 votes for <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, 120 for <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON> and 48 for <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>, easily giving <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> the party presidency on the first ballot. There were four invalid ballots. `` This is a crucial time for our party, so it will be a great responsibility,'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, a former education minister with little personal clout, told a news conference shortly after the vote. As <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s second new prime minister in two months, he will face the challenge of fending off a surging opposition <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and recovering the popularity the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have lost in a succession of scandals and a disliked tax policy. `` I want to carry out reforms and pass reform legislation based on our deep self-reflection,'' he said, replying to a question about his plan to regain public trust. He rejected the idea of holding elections immediately, as the opposition demands. `` Through debate we hope to gain the people's understanding of our policies'' before a general election, he said. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> will be elected Wednesday to succeed Uno on the strength of his party's large majority in the lower house of Parliament. He also will face the first test of the new political situation in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> created by the party's loss of control in the upper house in the July 23 elections. It is likely that the upper house will refuse to confirm him as prime minister and vote instead for <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, but under the constitution the lower house chooses the head of government, so the main effect will be to embarrass the Liberal Democrats. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> resigned to take responsibility for the July election loss, leaving the Liberal Democrats in their worst crisis since the party was formed in 1955 and began enjoying uninterrupted rule. The party's major figures were all ruled out of contention for the premiership by involvement in the Recruit influence-buying scandal. In June, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> stepped down because of links to the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate, but <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> hand-picked Uno as his successor. Backing from <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s faction was a key to <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s successful bid for party leadership. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> resigned last month amid allegations he kept paid mistresses. One of <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s first duties was a round of courtesy calls on faction leaders whose opinions will count as <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> names a Cabinet and party leadership. He said the party's reform plans try to tackle the problem of the high cost of politics, which results in part from the present system of multi-seat constituencies where Liberal Democratic factions finance candidates who run against each other. To get away from the problem of huge corporate donations, he said politicians should seek money from a wide range of individuals instead. Large donations from Recruit angered the Japanese public and helped send the Liberal Democrats' popularity skidding. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> has acknowledged that Recruit gave him about $ 110,000 over five years. The donations were legal, he said, but he regretted having received money from a company now accused of attempting to bribe politicians, bureaucrats and business leaders. Recruit, a publishing and information services conglomerate, sold stock at bargain prices to officials who turned around and sold the shares at a handsome profit. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> indicated he will try to persuade the public to accept a disliked 3 percent sales tax by earmarking the revenues for social welfare purposes. On foreign affairs, an area where he has little experience, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> pledged to maintain close security ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and said he would deal with problems in relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as they emerged. `` But at the same time, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is also a part of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. We should do whatever we can to cooperate in economic development'' with Asian nations, he said. He also said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should work with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to help President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform plans. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, because of a longtime territorial dispute with the Soviets, has had cool relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Oregon Mental Patient Has Run Away Before, Posing as Other People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> mental patient found outside a church in this eastern Canadian city has wandered off before, acting as another person, and her father says it is her way of dealing with mental anguish. The woman, who called herself <PERSON> Christina </PERSON>, has been identified as <PERSON> Rochelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallett </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> Premier <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, said Monday. <PERSON> Hallet </PERSON> said the brown-haired woman, about 19, was identified by <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> psychologist <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Beattie </PERSON>, who arrived Monday in St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s, where Ms. <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> has been hospitalized for treatment. Officials said Ms. <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> on Monday night insisted she was <PERSON> Christina </PERSON>. Her positive identification came one month after she was found wrapped in a blanket at a church, clinging to a doll. Doctors in the <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> capital said the woman indicated she was a severely handicapped 14-year-old with a life-threatening muscle disease that left her unable to walk or talk, though she could communicate through sign language. <ORGANIZATION> Rochelle </ORGANIZATION> has misled authorities on at least two other occasions, officials said. Although seemingly mute and handicapped, <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> was later found to be able-bodied and able to speak. Her father, <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON>, said Monday in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, that he is sure his daughter left <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Rochelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> but in her own mind she is n't <ORGANIZATION> Rochelle </ORGANIZATION> now. `` She has a mental diagnosis of a hysterical disassociation with regression and amnesia,'' he said. `` My intentions are to bring her home.'' <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> said he believes his daughter's adopting the persona of <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> was her way of dealing with mental anguish. He said the episodes are brought on by stress, but he could not think of any specific incidents other than the stress of adolescence. `` She disassociates from it. She thinks she is who she is,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Rochelle </ORGANIZATION> was living on her own in a low-income housing project after being discharged from a mental hospital last spring, he said. `` She was being seen on an outpatient basis and did a lot of volunteer work with nursing homes and with handicapped people,'' he said. The father said Ms. <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> left July 2, telling a neighbor she was heading for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> with $ 1,000 in her pocket. Ms. <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> had been living in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, with her mother and stepfather from the age of five, <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> said. At 18, she moved to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> to be with her father. The discovery of Ms. <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> on July 7 triggered an intense investigation that involved Canadian police, social and medical workers, customs officials, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard and <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>. She used sign language to tell doctors she came to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on a yacht with her mother, three men and a nanny. She was thought to understand English, German and a <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> dialect. News reports from January 1988 said she turned up at an airport in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, clutching a baby bottle and a handwritten letter authorities originally believed was written by her mother, said <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newfoundland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>. Three months earlier she was found in an airport bathroom in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, with a baby bottle and a similar letter that quoted from the Bible and blamed her apparent disabilities on falling short of the `` Lord's blessing.'' Lt. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> <PERSON> Twine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newfoundland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said police are satisfied <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> is <PERSON> Rochelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> but she had not admitted her identity Monday night. Nor had she started to walk or talk. `` She just does n't indicate anything,'' Twine said. <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> has been committed to the Waterford mental hospital in St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s. A lawyer has been appointed by the provincial <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to represent her.

 A worker who lighted a match in a basement where he was investigating a gas leak ignited an explosion that killed 18 people in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda reported today. The explosion Monday ripped through a five-story apartment house in <LOCATION> Mogilev-Podolsky </LOCATION>, about 660 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, bringing down part of the building and destroying 20 apartments, the paper said. Gas had accumulated from a leak in the building's basement, Pravda said. Two maintenance workers were dispatched to investigate, and one, identified as <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marushchak </PERSON>, `` lighted a match, and the explosion followed.'' <PERSON> Marushchak </PERSON> was killed, but his companion survived, along with five other tenants, Pravda said. More than 600 Soviets, many of them children, were killed in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> last June when sparks from a passing train ignited gas that had leaked from a major pipeline.

<TEXT>
 The official media is portraying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, as a man of the people who does not fear getting his hands dirty and is comfortable preaching homely socialist virtues. `` Let's sing a song together,'' he reportedly told workers at a <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> steelworks. `` We'll sing: ` We Workers Have Strength,' OK? `` `` Under Comrade <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>'s direction, the song rose loud and clear,'' the party newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, reported today in a front-page article titled `` General Secretary Among the People of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> returned Sunday from a five-day visit to the city where he was local party secretary until his June 24 appointment to the national post. He succeeded <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. Early in his two-year tenure, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> also was portrayed as a warm and personable man who enjoyed visits outside the capital to mingle with ordinary people. But since his ouster for allegedly supporting student pro-democracy protesters, the media has printed only harsh criticism of him and blamed him for virtually every problem <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> faces, from an unbalanced budget to corruption to poor worker morale. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, on the other hand, `` repeatedly stressed that we must rely entirely on the working class,'' <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Xinmen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said in a report on the party leader's visit. It said that while touring the No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factory </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> stopped to ask a young worker his age and what school he had attended. He then stuck out his hand, causing the youth to blush and try to wipe off his oil-covered hand. `` Never mind,'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said, grabbing the hand and pumping it. `` From now on we must rely on you'' workers. `` These words sank into people's ears,'' the report said. `` For a while people had become hazy about the leading role of the workers and the idea of the worker-peasant alliance as an ideological foundation.'' At the steelworks, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> noticed that some workers did not know all the words to the song that begins: `` We workers have strength, we workers have strength. Every day we are busy at work.'' `` We should sing this kind of song often,'' he admonished them. The paper added: `` Watching the scene, some comrades said, ` We have n't seen a scene like this for many years.' `` <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> also called for large and medium-sized businesses to take the lead in economic development, giving implicit support to the new post-Zhao emphasis on state ownership rather than privatization. Those sized companies tend to be state-owned, and most have large work forces with low productivity but guaranteed lifetime employment. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most efficient and fast-growing sector is its tiny private sector, but most of these companies are small. The reports said <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> rode about in a van on his tour, drank only tea and insisted on eating at home _ all in keeping with the government's current campaign to save money and encourage simple living. They also said he listened closely to the problems of local officials and often took notes. His only advice, however, appears to have been ideological. After listening to reports by officials in villages around <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> regarding export production, collective enterprises and population control, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> `` jotted down a plan for <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and its suburbs.'' His plan: `` Grasp well the building of party spirit, develop education in socialism, patriotism and hard work, and strengthen education in the national planning mentality.''

<HEAD>Government Demands India Finish Pullout Next Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said today it wants <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to withdraw all its troops by next month but that the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> government is offering a phased pullout that would finish in February. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON>, briefing <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> today on talks he had last week with Indian leaders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, said an end to <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> military operations should be `` immediate and unqualified.'' Indian troops began arriving two years ago to enforce a New Delhi-brokered peace plan aimed at ending an insurgency by minority Tamils fighting for autonomy in the north and east. About 43,000 are now stationed on the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island. `` The Indian position on withdrawal, on the basis of three shiploads per week of 1,500 to 1,600 personnel, including a three week preparatory period, will take 28 to 30 weeks and will end in February 1990,'' <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON>, who is also the deputy defense minister, told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> led a six-member delegation to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on July 29 to discuss a time frame for the pullout. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has already withdrawn 2,220 troops in phases since July 29, the date initially set by President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> for completion of the pullout. Sinhalese radicals have stirred up an anti-Indian campaign to protest the presence of Indian soldiers deployed in the Tamil-dominated north and east. The July 29, 1987, peace accord, which granted limited autonomy to those areas failed when the dominant Tamil group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, rejected it, saying it did not meet their aspirations for a homeland. On Indian troops halting military operations in the north and east, <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> to first unilaterally suspend military offensives for a 15-day period. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has linked the troop withdrawal with the devolution of powers to the Northeastern Council, formed under the peace accord, which gave Tamils limited autonomy in exchange for an arms surrender. `` Our position is the implementation of the agreement was not connected with the Indian troop withdrawal,'' <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON>'s statement will be debated in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> is expected to chair a meeting of his Cabinet Friday to announce Sri Lankan position on the issues. There will be no voting. Sinhalese extremists claiming the presence of Indian troops compromised the country's independence, have launched a vicious campaign against the government. At least 4,000 people, mainly government officials and supporters, have been killed in the two-year Sinhalese uprising. The Tamil insurgency has claimed 11,000 lives. Tamils form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, and Sinhalese make up 75 percent. Tamils accuse the Sinhalese of discriminating against them in jobs, education and use of the Sinhalese language. About 60 million Tamils live in southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>.

 Hurricane Dean swept over <LOCATION> Sable </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> with 89 mph winds before dawn and raced toward <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, where weather forecasters said it would weaken later today when it hits land. Seas in the area of the storm were reported running as high as 26 feet today as the storm pushed northeast at speeds of 35 mph toward the tiny French island of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierre </LOCATION> and the cooler waters of <LOCATION> Avalon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sable </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a sandspit 120 miles off <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, is home mostly to seals and wild ponies. A permanent weather station there remained staffed but no injuries or damages were reported despite high winds and heavy rains, forecasters said. Hurricane forecasters said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s path also includes St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>'s predominant city, but officials there had n't issued any special warnings. `` We're telling people to keep listening to their radios,'' one officer said. `` Coastal vessels would probably run for the nearest safe haven while ocean-going vessels would tend to track around the path of the hurricane,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cormier </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Search and Rescue Centre in <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, spokesman for the Canadian Hurricane Centre in <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> remained a full-fledged hurricane but was expected to quickly lose strength after hitting land this afternoon in <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>. At 6 a.m. EDT, the hurricane's center was 90 miles southwest of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierre </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> of the National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The center of the storm was near latitude 46.0 north and longitude 58.0 west, or about 235 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Race </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said winds peaked at 89 mph over <LOCATION> Sable </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and remain about 80 mph around the hurricane's center. A hurricane requires sustained winds over 74 mph. Hurricane Dean was spawned in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> last week. It churned its way across <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, leaving a trail of sunken boats and roofless homes. Several people were slightly injured. Most hurricanes approaching <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have been downgraded before they hit land. The last storm to reach <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> at hurricane force was Hurricane Blanche in 1975, which clipped <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> but caused only minor damage.

<TEXT>
 A former Soviet cosmonaut reveals in a new book that he was slated to beat the Americans to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> but that a top rocket designer's sudden death kept him grounded, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported today. The book about Soviet spaceman <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Bykovsky </PERSON>, titled `` Cosmonaut No. 5,'' contradicts the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s past denials that it ever intended to send a man to the moon. <PERSON> Bykovsky </PERSON>, in one of several frank reports on Soviet space failures to come out recently, describes how he began training for the lunar flight, expected as early as 1968, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. But the premature death of <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Korolev </PERSON>, the visionary chief designer of the Soviet space program, `` hampered and retarded the lunar program,'' the news agency said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> got ahead.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said design of the spaceship that was to take <PERSON> Bykovsky </PERSON> on a preliminary orbit around the moon began soon after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> shocked the world by launching Sputnik, the first satellite, in 1957. The new craft was named <ORGANIZATION> Zond </ORGANIZATION>, which means probe. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not specify why the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> never sent people to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>. Soviet officials have said they considered it too risky, too wasteful, and not as productive as sending robot probes. <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> astronaut <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> became the first human to set foot on the moon in 1969. This past July 20, the 20th anniversary of the moonwalk, Soviet television finally showed film clips of the event. American space expert <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> says in a 1981 book the Soviets may have been planning a manned flight around the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> for the 50th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1967. <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON>, in `` Red Star in Orbit,'' says <PERSON> Korolev </PERSON>'s premature death `` may have been the single most important contributing factor which prevented this cosmonaut lunar flight from occurring.'' <PERSON> Korolev </PERSON> died in 1966 from a botched operation, according to unofficial Soviet sources. The official Pravda obituary said he died of `` cardiac insufficiency'' after a cancer operation, and <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> referred today only to his `` sudden death.'' Recent Soviet revelations on space failures included an article this summer in the daring weekly <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> on what Western researchers believe to be the country's deadliest space-related disaster. A fully-fueled ICBM blew up on the launchpad in 1960, killing the head of the Soviet rocket forces and literally incinerating many others nearby. <PERSON> Bykovsky </PERSON>, a much-decorated cosmonaut, set a space endurance record of five days in 1963. He is chief of the Soviet research and engineering center in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Cosmonaut No. 5'' is not yet available in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but an official at its publisher, Politizdat, said the book about <PERSON> Bykovsky </PERSON> by author <PERSON> Grigory </PERSON> <PERSON> Reznichenko </PERSON> would be out soon.

<TEXT>
 Video store owners say they are being unfairly singled out by legislators who want to curb the rental of violent films such as `` Ninja Brothers of Blood'' and `` Night of the Demons.'' Video retailers attending the eighth annual Video Software Dealers Association convention, which entered its third day today, expressed concern that they soon might be prosecuted if they rent violence-filled features, even those rated PG-13, to children. The booming home video market is dominated by mass-appeal blockbusters like `` E.T. The Extra-Terrestial'' and how-to tapes. But the strong presence of low-budget, violence-filled features in thousands of rental stores has led to a number of bills aimed at limiting the availability of such cassettes to minors. A <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> bill that becomes law on Aug. 28, in fact, prohibits the rental to minors of tapes that have either a tendency to appeal to morbid interests or depict violence in a patently offensive way as judged by local community standards. `` We think it has a lot to do with the <ORGANIZATION> Meese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Horovitz </PERSON>, executive vice president of the video association, referring to the President Reagan-appointed commission on pornography and violence. `` We really believe that it is the fundamental responsibility of the parent to decide what their children can and can not watch. That's the only place where the decision can be made in the best interests of the child,'' she said. <PERSON> Horovitz </PERSON> said some of the films that could be covered by the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> bill are available to children on television or in theaters. A <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the marketplace _ not the government _ should decide what's acceptable `` We are committed to making the highest quality motion pictures and television shows that audiences want,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>. `` The audience should decide what they want and what they do n't want. `` We believe self-regulation is the best idea,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Castell </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Blockbuster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest chain with more than 820 stores `` We are concerned, however, about box art. As an industry, we have to police ourselves on that.'' Program suppliers frequently redesign movie package art to boost sales. A number of the so-called B titles are driven by lurid packaging _ the more graphic the cassette cover design, the better the cassette is expected to sell. But video retailers now find themselves under increased pressure to submit new art to the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> MPAA </ORGANIZATION>, which hands out movie ratings, demands that illustrations for MPAA-rated films be approved separately. Home video sales are expected to hit $ 10 billion this year. `` This is not a hard business. All you do is rent movies. Americans love movies,'' <PERSON> Kastell </PERSON> said. `` And they have an insatiable demand.'' A record 14,000 video retailers, distributors, producers and tape manufacturers have come to the convention to check out videos ranging from `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' to `` Balloonacy,'' a how-to video complete with 50 balloons and tips to create more than 30 inflated animals.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> called on Iranian leaders today to sign a peace treaty to end the eght-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, halted nearly a year ago by a U.N.-brokered cease-fire. In a television message marking the anniversary of the day <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution, <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> said a treaty would guarantee `` both countries' legitimate rights.'' `` The cease-fire agreement should not be taken as a talisman for peace ... we are after a comprehensive, total and lasting peace treaty,'' he said. Today was an official Iraqi holiday to mark the anniversary. On Monday night, thousands of people poured into a central <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> park for a fireworks display and traditional singing and dancing in a government-organized celebration. Crowds of teen-agers, some wearing traditional Arab robes, waved flags and portraits of <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> labeled `` the maker of peace and victory.'' On Aug. 8, 1988, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced the cease-fire would take effect Aug. 20, following <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s decision to drop a demand for direct talks before hostilities were suspended. Both sides accepted <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolution 598, calling for immediate withdrawals to pre-war borders, exchange of prisoners, formal peace talks and a panel to determine responsibility for the conflict that killed an estimated 1 million people. U.N.-sponsored talks on a peace treaty started Aug. 25 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> but deadlocked immediately. Three further rounds of discussions failed to make any progress. <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> noted in his speech that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has made no public declaration of its desire for peace, saying, `` The Iranian leaders have been far away from peace in their deeds and maybe in their intentions as well.'' He said the `` no peace-no war'' situation with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> created instability and `` countries in the region, fearing the worst, will remain on guard against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' The talks stalled over Iranian insistence that the next step in the peace process should be <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from about 380 square miles of Iranian territory it occupies. The Iraqis, however, say they do not recognize a 1975 treaty drawing part of the Iran-Iraq border down the middle of the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, their only outlet to the sea. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> maintains the border should be redrawn to include all the waterway as <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION>, and that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> should have the sole right to dredge it of mines and other war debris. He called for an immediate start to a full exchange of nearly 100,000 prisoners of war, saying `` it's a patriotic and humanitarian responsibility that these prisoners should be repatriated without delay.'' <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> added that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should avoid `` cheap bargaining'' on the POW issue in order to gain leverage at the peace talks. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has proposed that the POWs be swapped under an agreement separate from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says they can only be freed as part of an overall settlement of the conflict. So far, only 2,360 ailing and disabled prisoners have been repatriated under exchanges arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has demonstrated its wish for peace by demobilizing about 200,000 soldiers, almost one-quarter of its army, and freezing its paramilitary forces. The <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leader said that government projects for swift reconstruction of the war-damaged southern city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and the port of <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> is a further sign that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is seeking lasting peace. The war began in September 1980 when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after border skirmishes.

 Two men convicted of killing a teen-age girl whose wave they mistook for the signal of a rival gang drew 41-year prison sentences _ even more than state guidelines call for or the prosecutor sought. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON> said Monday the terms will be a message to those who commit gang crimes. `` Their crime is unique in its enormity,'' he said. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, 19, were convicted of murder July 5 in the shooting death of <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 17. They also were convicted of attempting to murder two other occupants of the car in which the girl was riding. The other occupants were not injured. State sentencing guidelines call for 26 to 34 years; prosecutors had asked for 36 years and 10 months for each. Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who had no gang ties, was riding with her friends on March 24 when she waved at someone she thought she recognized, police said. Police said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> and two other men associated with the Crips gang pursued the vehicle and opened fire. Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was hit in the head by a rifle bullet.

 Shiite Moslem fundamentalist leaders today again rejected talks on exchanging three Israeli servicemen and Western hostages for a kidnapped Moslem cleric held in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Their statements came amid indications that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> may be authorized by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s main ally in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, to negotiate the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> and 15 others held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> would be willing to use its influence in the hostage crisis if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to release billions of dollars of Iranian assets long frozen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks. They also came as as signs appeared of a rift in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new leadership over the hostage issue, pitting hard-line Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> against pragmatist President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. In a statement distributed in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tofaili </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> leader said, `` There shall be no contacts and no negotiations as long as <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> remains in captivity.'' `` This is the party's unshakeable conviction and this is what we shall do,'' <PERSON> Tofaili </PERSON> said, adding, `` <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is not concerned with the question of the hostages or the negotiations revolving around it.'' The hostage crisis was triggered when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos kidnapped <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, 33, from his home in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> July 28 and whisked him to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has offered to trade <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and all 450 Shiite prisoners it holds for the three Israelis and the Western hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> insists the cleric should be unconditionally freed. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s spiritual guide, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, said in a separate statement published by several <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers that <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s abduction left `` the region poised on a powder keg.'' `` That act of piracy led to the killing of the American officer <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said, referring to the announcement nine days ago by the underground Organization of the Oppressed on Earth that it hanged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s refusal to free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and movements of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' death reminded him of tensions that preceded <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` I do not rule out the possibility of a large-scale military operation by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to get itself off the hook in this crisis which it created,'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said. But the independent newspaper An-Nahar said today there were indications <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would `` coordinate and intensify efforts to resolve the hostage issue and defuse the crisis.'' `` This is expected to take its final shape when Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> arrives in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> soon for talks with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s government,'' <PERSON> An-Nahar </PERSON> said in a report from its <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> correspondent. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main ally in the 8-year gulf war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which ended in a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire last August. An-Nida, the organ of the pro-Moscow <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, quoted unnamed travelers from the Syrian capital as saying the government `` may have been authorized by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate the release of the Western hostages.'' It did not elaborate. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who commanded the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force, was kidnapped near Tyre in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Feb. 17, 1988. Longest held of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief AP <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent. He was kidnapped nearly 4 -LCB- years ago. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday paid tribute to <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> during a ceremony at Ft.. Myer, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the War Department, forerunner of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> In an emotion-filled voice, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We can not leave here today without pausing to salute one who stands as the symbol of the courage that burns in the breast of every American in uniform, one Marine who has been very much in our thoughts, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>.'' The videotape released last week in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> depicted a bound and gagged man hanging from a rope around his neck. Israeli government officials have said their sources indicated <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> had been killed some time ago. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was the target of past death threats by the terrorists, who called him a spy. <PERSON> An-Nahar </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was among countries requested by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene after another extremist group threatened to kill <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> in retaliation for <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s abduction. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, 58, was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986, from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> where he worked as acting comptroller. The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which claims to be holding <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, has asked <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to negotiate its offer through international organizations. <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> has made no public response and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejected the offer. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main power broker, with 40,000 troops stationed there under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. They control <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s strongholds in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums and east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley. The <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted a source close to <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as saying `` the first step should be taken by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and if <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> gets satisfied that its assets will certainly be unfrozen, then the second step will definitely come from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> froze more than $ 2 billion in Iranian assets after it broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> over the seizure of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> there in 1979. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> offered last week to help <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> resolve the hostage problem. But <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> appeared to challenge him in a speech Sunday night at the grave of the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. His speech, broadcast Monday by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, said there are `` many Hezbollah cells around the world created by the holy breath of the Imam <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> that cry death to the superpowers.''

<TEXT>
 Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> pledged today to get `` the Republican influence peddlers'' out of his troubled department and work for imrpoved opportunities for poor people to own their own homes. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> addressed the annual conference of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> a day after the civil rights organization issued a report saying that at the present rate of progress it would take black Americans 1,163 years to catch up with whites in home ownership. Before <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> spoke, delegates observed a moment of silence to express concern for Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> missing on an airplane flight in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` It is typical of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> that if a plane were missing and <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> was on it, it would be on its way to northern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to help the poor and those who have been left out,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. Turning to the investigations of questionable practices and insider profiteering during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in the department he now heads, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said: `` We're going to take the greedy and the consultants and the Republican influence peddlers out of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` I do n't want it to work for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; it should n't work for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; it's got to work for the people,'' he said. `` We want to take publicly assisted housing and publicly owned housing and, if it's possible and if there's some sweat equity involved and if people can homestead in this century as we should have done more of in the last century, we should give people a chance to own a home,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` We are going to do our very best to end the disgrace of redlining -LRB- refusal of lenders to provide mortgages in certain areas -RRB- in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to make sure that seed capital is flowing into low-income housing and low-income commmunities,'' he said. In its report Monday on the economic status of blacks, the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> called for new efforts to `` overhaul the stalled engine of racial progress.'' `` The impressive long-term progress of African-Americans has in more recent years stalled and, in some cases, even reversed,'' it said. Blacks are gaining on whites so slowly in employment and economic development that there appears little chance they will catch up before the middle of the next century, said the report by the league's research department. `` There is a commanding need to overhaul the stalled engine of racial progress,'' it said. One of the bleakest parts of the report was on housing, where the researchers reported that the black home ownership rate increased only from 64.6 percent of the 1970 rate for whites to 65.1 percent in 1985 _ a gain of half a percentage point in 15 years. As a result, the report said, it would take until the year 3152 for blacks to catch up with whites. `` The impact of legal discrimination was perhaps most dramatically manifest in the residential separation of the races,'' the report said. `` Institutional racism, as revealed in the racist policies and practices of mortgage lenders, housing developers, and real estate agents, has been equally consequential. `` Combined with the aversion whites have exhibited toward living in areas in which African-Americans exceed or might exceed a certain number, these factors have generated and sustained telling levels of residential segregation,'' it said. In education and health the prospects are a little better, said the report. But in some economic and health areas, including infant mortality, the researchers said gains are being made so slowly that they are unable to estimate when parity might be reached. By contrast, the number of blacks completing high school compared with whites increased so dramatically, from 55 percent in 1967 to 79 percent in 1985, that the league estimated parity should be reached in 16 years. The report said 43.7 percent as many whites as blacks were unemployed in 1985, compared with 45.9 percent in 1967. `` Major initiatives are necessary if this trend is to be checked,'' the league said. The report estimated it would take 54 years for blacks to reach parity with whites in managerial and professional occupations, 73 years in median earnings for full-time workers and an undetermined amount of time in family income. It estimated it will be 159 years, if present trends continue, before black poverty rates shrink to equal those of whites. One area where blacks lost ground was in earnings of their businesses, as a share of the earnings of all American companies. In 1972, this figure was nearly 20 percent. In 1982, it had shrunk to less than 7 percent. The report estimated it will take 55 years for <PERSON> black </PERSON> college enrollment to reach parity with white enrollment, 40 years for life expectancy, three years for voter registration and nine years for voting rates in congressional elections. In its bleak report on infant mortality, it said the white rate, as a percentage of the black rate, has declined from 54.6 percent in 1970 to just over 51 percent in 1985.

 Fire early today destroyed a rooming house whose landlord had been cited for failing to install sprinklers, killing at least three people, injuring 11 and leaving 13 unaccounted for, authorities said. Several people escaped the 12:30 a.m. blaze in the four-story brick tenement by jumping onto lower roofs. Others lowered themselves on ropes that tenants said had been supplied in rooms in place of a fire escape. It was not immediately clear whether local ordinances required fire escapes. One victim was believed to have been shinnying down a rope when he fell to the street, authorities said. Police said two more bodies were spotted in the ruins. Firefighters awaited the arrival of a crane to clear the debris. Early today 22 of the 35 residents believed to live in the house were accounted for, authorities said. `` We've got a grisly task ahead of us,'' said Fire Chief <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Numberg </PERSON>. The house had no sprinkler system, authorities said. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, an attorney for the city, said the owner, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Allard </PERSON>, was charged in January with failing to install sprinklers as required under a 1987 city ordinance. Last month, <PERSON> Allard </PERSON> was charged with operating a woodworking shop in the basement, a zoning violation, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Allard </PERSON> was at the scene this morning and refused to answer reporters' questions. The cause of the fire was under investigation. `` People were jumping out of windows, hanging on mattresses and climbing on ropes that knotted up and never reached bottom,'' <PERSON> Numberg </PERSON> said. One tenant who escaped said he had to drop about a story to the street when the rope in his room proved too short to reach from the window to the ground. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Clough </PERSON>, 43, another tenant, said ropes were a fixture in some rooms. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON>, 40, said he woke up when he smelled smoke, then broke a window and lowered himself to safety with a rope. He said there were smoke detectors in the building, but he did n't hear any go off. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, a depressed working-class coastal town of about 79,000, is 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Police Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> identified one of the dead as <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Amiro </PERSON>, 50. He was believed to have fallen while shinnying down a rope. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said seven other tenants were injured, along with two police officers and two firefighters. The police and fire injuries were not considered serious.

 Soviets do n't have much to laugh about these days, but <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> comedian <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> had them in stitches with slapstick and stand-up routines poking fun at long lines and superpower politics. `` I was raised thinking you were the enemy. You were raised thinking I was the enemy,'' <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> told an invitation-only audience of 600 people, about half foreigners and half Soviets. `` We were both wrong: It's the French.'' The 41-year-old native New Yorker, whose grandmother emigrated from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, brought his irreverent humor to the communist heartland to tape `` On Location: Midnight Train to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'' for broadcast in October on Home Box Office. He spent a few days taping skits for the special around town, then put on a 50-minute show Monday night at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Pushkin Theater. With staples such as meat, sugar and toothpaste in short supply, and ethnic violence, strikes and crime on the rise, Soviets need some comic relief. A few, at least, got it from Crystal. A Soviet woman who spoke English said she had never heard of him but decided to attend the show `` because we need positive emotions.'' She roared throughout but admitted afterward the `` dialogue was hard to understand.'' In an interview on Red Square, <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> agreed comedy was sorely needed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Here, there is a desperate need to be more open and have more fun,'' he said. The comedian, known for his imitations of <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and other celebrities, studied with a language coach and opened his show with a few minutes in Russian. `` I wanted to perform in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> because it has the best microphones,'' he said, referring to the new office building the Americans say they ca n't occupy because of <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> bugs. During the rest of the show, <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> did his best to help the Soviets bridge the language gap and was most successful with slapstick and mime. His impersonation of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> reciting a Russian tongue-twister was a big hit with Soviets, who are familiar with <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>'s soft-spoken manner from movies available on bootleg videotapes. Crystal, wearing a gray shirt and white pants that stood out against a huge red backdrop of a man and woman holding a hammer and sickle, also portrayed <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> scrounging for food in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. When he got some, it tasted terrible. About a dozen of his relatives in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> attended Monday's show. One called Crystal's comedy `` a new genre for us, but very interesting.'' In an interview, <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> said he had a tough time preparing for the special because `` there's no place to break the show in like Impravda or Catch a Rising Tsar.'' The Improv and Catch a Rising Star are comedy clubs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Standing outside <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s Mausoleum on Red Square, Crystal compared the resting place of the founder of the Soviet state to <LOCATION> Graceland </LOCATION>, the home of the late <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> that has become a shrine for fans. Crystal, who first visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in April, was asked if he had any advice for tourists. `` If you bring laxatives, it's a great place to be,'' he quipped. The funniest thing he saw during his visit, he said, was the shower curtain in his hotel room. `` It's this big,'' he said, making a tiny square with his hands.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> tire company Tuesday threatened to fire 1,200 striking black workers as strikes and lockouts crippled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s motor vehicle industry. In all, 13,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metalworkers </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at four automobile plants and two vehicle component factories are not working due to strikes or lockouts. Industry officials say the closed plants produce about two-thirds of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s motor vehicles. About 5,000 workers are on strike at <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION> Uitenhage </LOCATION>, about 3,600 workers from the Toyota plant near <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> have been locked out and fired, and about 3,000 workers are on strike at two plants of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which produces Fords and Mazdas. On Monday, British-owned Eveready locked out 800 workers at its Uitenhage plant because of a wage dispute. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> followed suit on Tuesday, saying the 1,200 workers who have been on strike for five weeks at its factory in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> would be fired unless they signed an undertaking by Friday that they would accept employment conditions proposed by the South African management in the wake of disinvestment by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> parent company. The strikes against the three auto manufacturers, which began last week, are linked to the union's ongoing efforts to negotiate a wage agreement on a nationwide basis with all major auto companies. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> has been the most adamant in resisting such negotiations, and says its dismissed workers will lose all chance to reclaim their jobs unless they reapply by Monday. Auto manufacturers not yet affected by the current wave of labor disputes include <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>, BMW and <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>.

 Poor visibility hampered rescuers searching today for a plane carrying <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and 13 other people that vanished en route to a refugee camp near the Sudanese border. Heavy cloud cover made an aerial search of more than 400 miles of rugged terrain from this capital to <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s destination in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> nearly impossible, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON>, charge d'affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. At a briefing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>, said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had telephoned <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s wife in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to express his concern and assure her the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had offered full assistance to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. She said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> also had called Mrs. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>. `` At this point no news is good news,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>, who recalled being on similar trips with the congressman in the past where air travel and communications were disrupted. <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials in contact with police and communications points along <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s flight path reported a small plane was sighted Monday circling a field at <LOCATION> Dembidolo </LOCATION>, about 75 miles from the Fugnido refugee camp where the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Democrat group was bound. `` If it was our plane, what we find encouraging is that it would have transversed a lot of the more treacherous terrain to Fugnido,'' <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON> said. `` The plane circled, but the pilot obviously felt that he did n't want to put down at that time.'' <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dembidolo </PERSON> was in an inaccessible region far from any communication points, `` which could provide a benign explanation for why we have n't heard anything.'' But he said the region contained several fields suitable for landing that were cleared by the government to airlift food to people during the 1984-85 famine that ravaged much of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Light aircraft that left early today to search for <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and his party were concentrating their efforts in the <LOCATION> Dembidolo </LOCATION> area, said <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON>. However, a dense cloud cover and poor visibility was hampering their efforts, he said. The missing Twin Otter plane that <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> was traveling in is commonly used for bush flying. Officials with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, coordinating the search, said a C-130 Hercules cargo plane was standing by to help in case of an emergency. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> said the pilots were following the general route the plane would have taken to the Fugnido camp, 480 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. Planes must fly over rough terrain to reach the camp, but the aircraft would not pass over the area where rebels are battling <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s government. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s separatist movements are based in the northern part of the country in the Horn of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The missing plane, which also carried eight other Americans including staff members and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> personnel, was last heard from Monday morning about 15 minutes after leaving <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> said. `` It was about 25 miles outside of Addis at the time,'' said <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>. `` That was the last contact we had.'' Five Ethiopians, including three government officials, the pilot and co-pilot, also were aboard the airplane owned by <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the government relief agency The plane was due back in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> at 5 p.m. Monday. <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> said <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s departure for Fugnido Monday had been delayed for two hours because of bad weather in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> and it was possible the plane was diverted to a remote field or landing strip. `` We are not discounting the possibility they put down someplace,'' said <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>, a political and economics officer. `` It is very possible because of the nature of the weather.'' Communications in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest countries, are minimal outside of the capital, and the flight to the camp is over rough terrain. The Fugnido camp is run by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees and is one of four camps in the region that are home to more than 300,000 refugees who have fled civil war in neighboring <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger. He has taken a keen interest in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s refugees, and visited the same area in March, officials said <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> early Monday and was expected to spend two to three days in the East African nation. After visiting <PERSON> Fugnido </PERSON>, he had been scheduled to meet government officials and visit <LOCATION> Gondar </LOCATION>, the home of about 10,000 Falasha Jews in northwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Residents Return in Idaho; California Firefighters Make Progress</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with evacuated residents returning home in
Idaho, Utah and California fires contained, increase acreage of Idaho to
43,000, new warning on lightning danger. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Firefighters in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> contained two large blazes and dozens of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> residents returned home today a week after fires forced them out. But a `` red flag'' went up for the third straight day, warning of lightning strikes. Spotter planes cruised over Western forests in a search for lightning-sparked fires after thousands of storm bolts struck the region. Fire bosses said they saw no immediate evidence of a new round of major blazes. `` The next two days should tell,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the federal fire command post. `` There have been some strikes, but it takes time until we'll spot whether they've touched off new fires.'' Fire center officials today posted a `` red-flag'' warning of dry thunderstorms and gusting wind. About 23,000 firefighters on Monday fought the worst of blazes on 182,000 acres, primarily in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, according to the fire center. The fire battles have cost more than $ 27 million, with the bill rising sharply each day, the center said. More than 220,000 acres have been charred in a bout of mostly lightning-caused fires that began July 26. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the most heavily burned state, more than 9,000 people were committed to extinguishing to the blazes, including a 43,000-acre series of fires that destroyed a small resort town 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>. Early today, dozens of residents who fled their homes more than a week ago because of those fires were allowed back `` on the condition they be prepared to leave immediately again,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said. `` A big wind could change the picture real fast,'' he said. About 25 people in the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> summer home area remained evacuated because of the fire danger. Nearly 5,000 firefighters in southern and central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> contained two blazes that blackened thousands of acres of forest and wilderness for more than a week. Firefighters were mopping up a 7,550-acre fire in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> foothills east of <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> and a 15,300-acre blaze in the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, which was ignited by a target shooter's bullet nine days ago. It torched a house and trailer and neared the historic <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palomar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> earlier in the week. Lightning struck about 700 times Monday in six Western states. Most of the new fires were small. The largest had burned five to seven acres in the <ORGANIZATION> Ochoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in central Oregon. Hundreds of federal troops moved through the <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> fire center for training and eventual deployment. But land managers continued pressing for more manpower. Before the lightning, firefighters in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> had consolidated gains made during cool weather last week and predicted that many of the 100 fires that had burned nearly 89,000 acres would be contained by midweek. Airplanes sent over national forests Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to look for smoke found dozens of lightning-caused fires, most of which were quickly contained. Near <LOCATION> Coalville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, about 45 miles east of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, firefighters finished digging a circle around a 1,700-acre blaze, and authorities hoped to bring it under control tonight. In northwestern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, a fir that blackened 3,000 acres of brush and timber in canyon country near <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION> was largely contained.

 Immigration officials say they are just following guidelines in trying to deport the children of two Mexican nationals who have worked in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for years and may receive amnesty. The children, aged 10 and 11, have no place to go if they are sent back to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> because their grandmother, with whom they used to stay, has moved across the border to <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>, relatives say. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, district director the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said one parent can also return to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> if deportation is ordered. The family says it wo n't split up, even if it means both parents have to return to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and forfeit their chance at legalization. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia-Guiverra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Francesca </PERSON> <PERSON> Guadarrama-Fuentes </PERSON> hold INS-approved jobs in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> and are waiting for decision on whether they worked in the fields for long enough to qualify for the amnesty program that was signed into law in November 1986. Their children, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia-Guadarrrama </PERSON>, lived with their grandmother in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> at first but joined them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in June 1987. In January, when the family was stopped near <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>, problems arose. Border Patrol officers tried to deport the children on the spot, but agreed to permit a hearing after the parents protested, according to lawyers. The parents then turned to <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION>, and legal aid lawyers asked INS to grant the children an exemption under a Family Fairness program designed to keep families together. But <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials said the children did not qualify because they were n't in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before November 1986. Instead, they asked a hearing officer for immediate deportation. The November 1986 cutoff is arbitrary, legal aid attorney <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wettstein </PERSON> said. `` They have to draw a line someplace and it just happens that it's on top of these kids heads,'' she says. `` These were guidelines that came from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` It was a national policy that was accepted or adopted by the commissioner of naturalization and immigration.'' The parents entered the country illegally in the first place, and even if they can now benefit from amnesty, there's no reason to extend that benefit to the children, Ms. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> added. `` We've always worked hard,'' <PERSON> Garcia-Guiverra </PERSON> said Monday, with Ms. <PERSON> Wettstein </PERSON> as translator from <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION>. `` We're not a problem for the government.'' Although <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> is pressing for a decision from the hearing officer, Ms. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said Monday it might be willing to hold off on deportation even if the hearing officer authorizes it. `` That type of discretionary authority is there,'' she says. The statement comes as a surprise to Ms. <PERSON> Wettstein </PERSON>, who says <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has already refused several proposals to put the issue on hold.

 A storm during a packed prayer service at a 10,000-seat amphitheater pelted participants with hail and cold rain and sent people scrambling for cover. At least 130 people were taken to hospitals. Two of the injured were taken to a coronary intensive care unit, while the rest were treated and released Monday night, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, medical coordinator for the five-day Lutheran national youth conference. Most were treated for dizziness and hypothermia, or low body temperature, from getting soaked by the rain, which dropped the temperature 20 degrees to about 45. About 9,000 teen-agers from across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were participating in the service, dubbed Fire Power, when the storm broke, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> director of parks and arenas. The arena is in a park belonging to the city of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> but is outside the city limits. `` When you have youths dressed in T-shirts and shorts and a storm can kick up and drop temperatures 20 degrees, you get some borderline hypothermia cases,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. Four helicopters and 35 ambulances were brought in to treat the crowd. `` The crowd had to leave the amphitheater, and there was some panic as people were leaving. Some suffered hyperventilation and some had hypothermia as they were getting wet,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Etter </PERSON>, a parks department director. <PERSON> Etter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilling </PERSON>, superintendent of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s mountain parks system, went to investigate. `` As far as <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> can tell, there was no functional problem -LRB- with the amphitheater -RRB- but a storm and crowd problem,'' she said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, who led a group of 26 students from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, attributed much of the panic to altitude sickness. Red Rocks, the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> park where the amphitheater is situated, is at 6,400 feet, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. `` As it started to rain, there was no covering, so people went to the wall for cover,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. `` The people never had time to get rested from the long walk up to Red Rocks.'' <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Westerman </PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 40, remained today at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anthony </LOCATION>'s Central for treatment of chest pains, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Bev </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> stepped up demands Tuesday for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to let a South Korean student who visited the communist nation return home via the border at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of increasing tensions by turning the truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> into a `` political carnval'' with groups from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> shouting `` Yankee go home!'' and making obscene gestures at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guards. Officials in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said the communist government in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> sent two telephone messages to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government Tuesday asking for meetings at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> to discuss the return of 20-year-old radical student Im Su-kyong. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which has said it will arrest Ms. Im when she returns, did not reply immediately. At the 450th meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> held Tuesday in <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> demanded the U.S.-led <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> reconsider its refusal to allow Ms. Im to cross the border. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ui </PERSON> <PERSON> Ung </PERSON>, the chief North Korean delegate, said it was `` quite natural and proper'' for Ms. Im to return home through the border and `` there is no need for her to make the long way around'' and travel through third countries. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rear Adm. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> delegation, responded that Ms. <PERSON> Im </PERSON>'s crossing concerns the two Koreas and `` is not armistice business.'' <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has used Ms. Im and her supporters to create a `` political carnival'' at the border with demonstrations, banners, and protesters shouting `` Yankee go home.'' He said groups visiting the North Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone around <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> in July shouted slogans, and swore at and made obscene gestures toward those on the other side of the border. <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> said, `` Even the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> youths and other Americans who visited <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> shouted with indignation towards your GIs, ` Why have the Americans came to another's country to serve as watchmen of division?''' Observers said the demonstrations often included Ms. Im and foreigners attending the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students July 1-8 in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. The student has said she will cross the border on Aug. 15, the anniversary of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, in a demonstration for unification of the countries divided after World War II. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> says her illegal visit is a breach of national security. Ms. Im has become a celebrity in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, according to North Korean military observer Lt. Col. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki </PERSON> <PERSON> Oon </PERSON>.

 A rocket slammed into a large military depot for ammunition today, setting off a chain reaction of explosions that rocked the capital. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the attack at dusk. Ambulances rushed to the scene. As the blasts echoed across the city, an electrical outage plunged <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> into darkess for about 20 minutes. Black smoke, meanwhile, billowed over northwest <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> where the depot was on fire. The depot is about a half mile from a large residential neighborhood. The almost nonstop wave of explosions was continuing two hours after rocket hit. It was one of about six rockets fired late today. They followed a lull in such attacks earlier in the day. However, more than 115 rockets have crashed into the city during the past four days. No group claimed responsibility for today's attack, but U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting to oust the Soviet-allied government have tried repeatedly to hit military targets in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, with little success. Since late June, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has been hit by almost daily rocket attacks, but most have struck civilian areas. At least 281 people have been killed and 745 injured in the rocket attacks and a car bombing, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources. More than 40 rockets hit the capital Monday, the worst day of the recent blitz. Eight people were reported killed. There were initially reports today that the depot was set on fire by sabotage. However, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources confirmed it was hit by a rocket. A well-informed military source said the Afghan army recently moved a large amount of ammunition from the city's airport to the depot.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Police Break-up Protest at Site of Refugee Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police Tuesday broke up a nine-day sit-in by residents unhappy over the influx of Vietnamese refugees. About 100 police carried 26 protesters from the site in a rural park, authorities said. The demonstrators linked hands and sang before the officers moved in. `` One or two of them did struggle a little bit, but none of them very violently,'' said district police commander <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Younge </PERSON>. There were no arrests, he said. Up to 300 protesters had assembled at the site during the sit-in, although only 26 were there during the early morning raid. The protesters said they are concerned that the construction of a camp for Vietnamese refugees would pollute a nearby reservoir. They also have said they are unhappy with the influx of Vietnamese into the British colony. Local residents met later Tuesday in the nearby village of <LOCATION> Sai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kung </LOCATION> and said they would hold a mass protest demonstration, government-funded radio reported. No date was given. A <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government spokesman said construction at the site, which was delayed by the sit-in, had resumed. The government is building the detention center to shelter Vietnamese fleeing their communist homeland. More than 52,000 boat people have taken refuge in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Also on Tuesday, Japanese officials said two wooden boats carrying 280 Vietnamese refugees arrived in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. One boat with 151 Vietnamese arrived near a small island northwest of <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Keisuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakamoto </PERSON>, spokesman for the local <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s coast guard. The second boat, carrying 129 refugees, arrived in the same area. Since May, 592 boat people have come ashore in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted the latest boat people as saying they left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to escape poverty. <PERSON> Sakamoto </PERSON> said they were to be taken to a refugee reception center. At an international conference in June, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> called for forced repatriation of boat people not fleeing political persecution. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> refuses to accept such people.

<HEAD>71 Feared Dead in Latest Attack by Pirates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of pirates who stormed a boat carrying 84 Vietnamese stole valuables, raped women and sunk the vessel, and 71 of the refugees were feared dead, officials said Tuesday. The attack brought to 271 the number of boat people missing and believed dead as a result of piracy off the coast of this Southeast Asian country this year, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> officials said. The officials, quoting the 13 survivors of the latest attack, said the refugees left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> last week. They were off the <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trengganu </LOCATION> coast, 180 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, when they were attacked Saturday night by pirates in two boats. The pirates took their valuables, raped some of the women, sank the refugees' boat and fled, the officials said. The officials did not say how the attackers were armed. In the past, refugee officials have blamed most such attacks on Thai pirates. Three survivors of the attack were rescued by oil rig workers Sunday in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, and fishermen picked up the other 10. Refugee officials said the survivors were being put into a refugee camp to await screening for settlement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or elsewhere. In one of the worst such attacks in recent years, a <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> refugee boat with 130 people aboard was stormed by Thai pirates April 16. One refugee survived, but the rest are believed dead. Officials say this year's death could actually be much higher than 271, because some attacks leave no survivors and go unreported. The refugee officials say they believe most of the pirates were Thais. About 23,000 Vietnamese refugees live in Malaysian camps. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> accepts them only for temporary stay before permanent settlement elsewhere.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist <PERSON> Berke </PERSON> Breathed, whose last `` Bloom County'' comic strips appeared in newspapers last weekend, will be a contributing editor at Boating magazine, the magazine announced Tuesday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of Boating, said in a statement from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that Breathed, an avid boater who has homes in <LOCATION> Evergreen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, will write a monthly humor column titled `` Overboard.'' Breathed, who owns four boats, said his column will reflect his consuming interest in the sport. `` ` Boating' looks at equipment in the way I want to look at equipment _ what's coming out, and why we silly boaters think that a new-style helm station is exciting,'' he said in the statement. `` The emphasis is on the engineering and the equipment, rather than the events and personalities.'' Breathed discontinued `` Bloom County,'' which featured Opus the penguin, to begin work on a new strip called `` Outland'' that will begin appearing Sept. 3. `` Outland'' features a black ghetto child who was a `` Bloom County'' regular, with Opus possibly making appearances. Breathed won the Pulitzer Prize for cartooning in 1987.

 First, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new president offered to help solve the hostage crisis, then the interior minister renewed threats against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> newspaper was offering help again. The events seem to be part of a tug of war between President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and his followers _ called pragmatic by some and opportunist by others _ and the hard-liners of Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> for control of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> following the death in June of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> made the offer of help in his inaugural speech last week. On Monday, <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> urged Shiite Moslems around the world to continue fighting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> cals the `` great Satan.'' On Tuesday, the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted a source it did not identify as saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would `` definitely'' intercede to gain the release of the hostages if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> gave assurances it would release frozen Iranian assets. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, allied with spiritual leader <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, is known to seek better ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in the effort to rebuild <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after eight years of war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. He appears to see freeing the hostages as a first step to good relations. <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>'s faction, including Premier <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, son of the revolutionary patriarch, wants the revolution to keep its confrontational edge. For hard-liners, diplomatic reliations mean compromise with the enemy. Many radical Shiite Moslems in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> agree with them. Sixteen Western hostages are held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, most by <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> groups sponsored by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Eight are Americans. About $ 2 billion in assets, including military equipment ordered before the revolution, were frozen after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was stormed in February 1979 by militant students, who held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims the assets now are worth $ 12 billion. According to the source quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assurances that the assets will be released `` should be concrete and there should be convincing grounds that these proposals will be translated into action.'' Excerpts of the report were carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Repeating <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s frequently stated position, the source said: `` It's a well-known fact that we do not have any direct or indirect hand in hostage-taking. Of course, we have spiritual influence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> which we can use in our efforts for the release of the hostages there.'' <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>, former deputy foreign minister and a <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> ally, was quoted in a dispatch from the news agency as saying `` it would be a great achievement for the world of Islam'' if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could secure the release of the hostages. `` It will make it clear that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has always been working for the benefit of humanity,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> had helped improve diplomatic relations with the West, but resigned earlier this year when a struggle over the issue began in the leadership. In an editorial Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> called the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` an oppresser'' for freezing the assets and said relations between the two countries would be like that of `` lamb and wolf.'' It added, however: `` As the officials of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> have said repeatedly, the doors are not completely closed and the right intentions and thoughts can help resolve the problems.''

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> art dealer agreed today to give the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> access to four sixth-century mosaics while she decides whether to appeal a judge's order to return them to the Cypriots. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noland </PERSON> ruled Thursday that dealer <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> had not obtained valid title to the mosaics when she bought them last summer in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for $ 1.2 million. Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> had refused to surrender the mosaics until she decided whether to appeal. On Friday, the Cypriots demanded immediate release of the artworks, but an agreement was worked out before a hearing on the request began today. The agreement allows the Cypriots immediate access to the mosaics in an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> vault. The Cypriots agreed not to remove the mosaics or do any restoration work for two weeks while Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> decides whether to appeal. If she does not appeal, the Cypriots can take the mosaics home. The Republic of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and the church had sued Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> to recover the works, which had been stripped from a church in Turkish-occupied <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in the late 1970s. `` Today is a great day for <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Fifteen years of hard work in securing our artifacts, our cultural heritage, have not been wasted,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>, senior counsel to the Republic of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Cypriot officials learned of the mosaics' whereabouts when Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> offered them to the J. Paul Getty Museum in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for $ 20 million in January. The Cypriots sued Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> in March. <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, an attorney for the Cypriots, said a local Greek Orthodox priest had been asked to bless the church treasures, which date to 525 A.D. and depict <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> as a boy.

 A sharp earthquake shook the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area for 10 seconds early today, breaking glass, causing rock slides and apparently prompting a man to jump to his death from a fifth-story window, authorities said. The quake, measuring 5.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, occurred at 1:13 a.m. and was centered on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION> about 13 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey. It was felt as far as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, 230 miles south of here. No major damage was reported. The quake struck as state and federal emergency officials were about to begin a two-day test of earthquake communications procedures. The drill involved a mock earthquake in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area in which 5,000 people die. `` It felt like I was having my bed rolled around on a skateboard. I woke up and I was moving,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, next to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. Two aftershocks measuring 4.2 and 4.5 rippled through the area later this morning. State officials warned there could be more quakes in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the next five days, with a quake up to 6.2 possible but not likely. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>, 50 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a 19-year-old man was apparently startled awake by the earthquake and jumped out of his bedroom window, police dispatcher <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said in a statement. The shaking sent rocks tumbling onto highways, said a <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> emergency dispatcher who declined to give her name. `` They cleared the debris by hand and all roads are now cleared,'' she said. `` There was some damage in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> police Officer <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>. `` It was mainly broken windows and mirrors. Nothing serious.'' The false ceiling in a vacant <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION> business came down, and half a dozen businesses reported broken windows, police said. `` I felt a little rumble and then all the windows started shaking real bad,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Soliday </PERSON>, a clerk at an all-night convenience store in <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>. `` Some stuff in the aisles fell down. There's broken glass, dented cans, some beer bottles broken.'' The epicenter was in almost exactly the same place as a 5.0 quake on June 27, 1988, said <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> geophysicist <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>. Residents shaken awake by the temblor described it as jolting and rolling. `` It was the strongest I've ever felt,'' said <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, 38, who lives in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Haight-Ashbury </LOCATION> district. `` I live in an old building that was built after the 1906 quake, and it really had me going,'' <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said. `` It felt like you were sitting on a saw horse, rocking back and forth.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Great Quake, which occurred in 1906 before the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3. Recent estimates say more than 2,000 people died in the quake and the fire it touched off, which burned much of the city. The open-ended <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seisomograph. Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to 6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of 6.0 can cause severe damage. In March 1964 an earthquake in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> hit 8.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, killing 114 people.

The lawmaker entered the Legislature from a poverty-stricken section of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> as a civil rights activist with a militant reputation. He wore a big Afro, a leather shoulder bag, African print shirts and high-heeled boots. As his career grew, his attire during the early years of his three terms in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> gave way to business suits, and he has since shared a fashionable home in an upscale <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> neighborhood with his wife, <PERSON> Alison </PERSON>, and son <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON>, who was baptized by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Bishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. His political style also has moderated somewhat since his election to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1978. He replaced the retiring Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. Representing an inner-city district, he faced no Republican opposition and defeated a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate with more than 96 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> won re-election five times with ease, but drew a harsh 1988 primary challenge from <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Spates </PERSON>, who charged that <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> had lost touch with constituents while seeking national exposure as spokesman for the hungry and homeless. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> won the primary with 82 percent of the vote but acknowledged some truth in Ms. <PERSON> Spates </PERSON>' allegation. `` There's people I've not touched in a long time. This has been a great exercise for me,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. `` I feel very confident that my community is very solidly behind me now. Before there was some question _ I have been on the road quite a bit. I have been going abroad.'' In an article for the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s `` personal diplomacy'' with Ethiopian and Sudanese officials `` opened up life-sustaining corridors in the border region between the two countries _ a peaceful -LRB- relief -RRB- supply route.'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, who also serves on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and was twice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, often has thrust himself into the position of mediator in matters of international or interracial consequence. For 10 years, he has overseen a program in which black youths from his district were sent to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for six-week stays. He was honored in April by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations for his work in uniting blacks and Jews. He is one of several congressmen investigating colonias along the Mexican border, where thousands live in communities witout running water, electricity and sewage systems. He joined two other congressmen last October in a trip to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in an effort to negotiate the release of five political prisoners and their families. The delegation got three prisoners freed; a fourth decided to remain in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who chose <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> as one of the top four fund-raisers in his 1988 presidential campaign, praised the `` consistent streak of humanity in <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'' during an election year trip to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. His name has often been circulated as a possible mayoral candidate in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, although he has indicated greater interest in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Senate race. Despite his political roots, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> has maintained a close relationship with the business establishment in downtown <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, which is in his district. He said in a 1988 interview that success has not changed his views. `` I certainly do n't apologize for making myself better,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. But he added, `` It would be a profound contradiction if I was getting rich and forgetting my constituents.''

 Up to 14 million American families are `` living on the knife edge of homelessness'' and may be forced onto the streets by a mild recession, a private study concluded Tuesday. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affordable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that public efforts to help the homeless rely too little on prevention, are badly underfinanced and uncoordinated and are conducted by officials often unaware of the resources available to them. `` People are falling through <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s too loosely meshed safety net,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, director of the institute, said at a news conference. `` People are n't getting the services governments say they want to provide.'' The report by the institute, a research center at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, estimated that there are 4 million to 14 million American families `` living on the knife edge of homelessness'' who could face life on the streets should a mild recession occur. `` They are one pay check, one domestic argument from the streets,'' the report said. `` In a mild recession, homelessness in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is likely to double and triple almost overnight.'' Estimates on the current number of homeless people range between 655,000 to 4 million, but the total is growing 20 percent to 40 percent annually, the study said. The main federal program for the homeless is the <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> Homeless Assistance Act, a 1987 law named for the late <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman who was active on homelessness issues. The legislation gave the government authority to spend up to $ 3 billion over five years for programs for the homeless, but through this year <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has actually provided only $ 1.1 billion. The report said the law's broad range of programs covering temporary and permanent housing, drug counseling, health care and educational services are the right steps to take. But it complained that the legislation `` is not even an effective national treatment for homelessness for it is still seriously underfunded.'' Besides studying federal efforts, the report surveyed state homelessness efforts. `` Plans submitted by each state indicate in many instances a lack of coordination, capacity and compassion in addressing the needs of their homeless populations,'' it said. The study singled out <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, for for having programs that effectively help some people avoid living on the streets.

<HEAD>Estonians Approve Strict Voting Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers in the republic of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> on Tuesday tightened residency requirements for voting and running for office in a move to stem the influence of Russians. <PERSON> Ina </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamet </PERSON>, an editor at official <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>'s Supreme Soviet approved the law by a 194-36 margin. Russians make up about a third of the republic's 1.6 million people, and some Russian workers went on strike for several days in July to protest the legislation. Ms. <PERSON> Tamet </PERSON> said there were reports the Russian workers would strike again after the law was approved, but Estonian journalists had no firm information that a strike would follow. The law requires that residents live in one place for two years, or in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for five years before they be permitted to vote. It requires candidates for local offices to live in one place for five years, or if they've moved within <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> to be residents of the republic for 10 years before they may run, Ms. <PERSON> Tamet </PERSON> said. Despite the dispute over provisions of the law, she said the legislative debate was `` relatively quiet.'' Estonians, who are at the forefront of the three Baltic republics' drive for greater local control over the economy and political system, say they are being overrun by Russians and other Soviet ethnic groups, imported to work in the republic's factories. Ethnic Estonians are more stable, and therefore would gain from the new election law. In July, the national legislature also gave <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and the two other Baltic republics, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, the go-ahead to begin wide-ranging economic reforms, including the possibility of creating their own currencies. Economic reformers say that is essential to help them reform the price structure. They view the rigid Soviet system of state-control prices as one of the biggest handicaps they must overcome.

<HEAD>Witch Coven Wins Tax Break</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Witchcraft is a legitimate religion and its churches, or covens, are entitled to the same tax breaks as those of more established religions, the state division of taxation has ruled. `` With this ruling, we witches will definitely be able to come out of the closet and take our place in society,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegrist </PERSON>, 45, high priestess of Rosegate Coven. She said the coven has a core group of 11 members and 30 to 40 initiates. The ruling announced today by Tax Administrator <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> overturned an earlier decision that said the coven did not meet criteria for being a church. The coven, also known as Our Lady of the <ORGANIZATION> Roses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiccan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, will no longer have to pay state sales tax for supplies. `` This decision demonstrates that, with a properly presented case, even unusual or small religious groups can be treated equally with more mainstream religions by the state,'' said <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lawyer who announced the decision. He represented the witches in an administrative hearing in May. Hearing officer <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who recommended that <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> grant the exemption, ruled July 20 that the coven fulfilled most of the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s criteria for determining the legitimacy of a religion. The Wiccans are a nonprofit group, not set up for the purpose of avoiding taxes, and have a litany or system of prayer, as well as specific doctrines and practices that all members of the coven were expected to follow, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> ruled. Last fall, when the tax exemption was denied, the division's questions indicated that officials were focusing on the apparent lack of formal theology schools for training wiccan clergy, and also on their willingness to allow members to belong to other churches, <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said The latter argument was rebutted when the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlburn </PERSON>, senior minister of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unitarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION>, testified that his church and many Eastern religions also permit their members to belong to other faiths, <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said.

 Move over teen-agers, `` driver's ed'' is n't just for kids any more Drivers aged 55 and over who took a refresher course had fewer traffic convictions and serious accidents than did their cohorts who did n't return to the classroom, according to a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> study released Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> said the study is evidence that proper training can help older people `` remain safe drivers longer.'' `` To lose the ability to drive often traps older people in their homes,'' said <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> President-elect <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>. `` For older Americans, driving a car is more than just transportation. It means independence and dignity.'' Drivers over age 65 are second only to those age 15 to 24 in traffic accidents, and, when the number of miles driven is taken into account, the two groups are almost equal. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> says the verdict is n't in yet on whether refresher courses actually change driver performance for older Americans. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedlund </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> study `` certainly gives us more positive information than we had before.'' The study compared driving records for 40,339 graduates of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s eight-hour Mature Driver Improvement Program with those of 75,064 older drivers who did not take the course. All were aged 55 or above; with ages ranging into the 80s. Factoring out differences between the two groups in gender, prior driving record, age, and area of residence, the graduates had 16 percent fewer accidents involving death or injury and 15.7 percent fewer traffic convictions. The report cautioned that drivers who signed up for the voluntary training were `` a highly self-selected group who would be expected ... to have lower subsequent accident rates.'' Neverthless, it said, there was `` suggestive evidence'' that the courses were responsible for at least some of the reduction in accident risk. `` We feel the results are quite suggestive and promising,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, director of research for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the positive results, neither <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> nor the <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> advocated mandatory driver's education for older Americans, saying unwilling participants make poor students. `` Drivers with real bad attitudes and bad records probably would be irresponsive to it,'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> added: `` Age does not determine your driving ability. There are people who are 80 years old that are much better drivers than people who are 50.'' State laws in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and 28 other states make older Americans eligible for reduced auto insurance premiums, with discounts of up to 10 percent, if they take an approved refresher course. Twenty-six of those laws have been passed since 1986. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> study recommended that `` caution be exercised in any promotional efforts to substantially increase the proportion of elderly drivers who enroll in a mature driver program'' because that could bring in people who are greater accident risks and diminish the rationale for giving insurance discounts.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, telling a group of civil rights leaders `` your problems are my problems,'' vowed today to work toward stopping the decline of inner cities and making `` the'90s a decade of urban renaissance.'' `` We must create conditions for urban growth and economic revival, conditions that leave no one behind,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in remarks to the 79th annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no mention of current disputes between his administration and civil rights advocates. But he said at one point, `` Before I go on _ I want to make sure everyone in this room knows just where I stand, just where our administration stands. My administration is committed to reaching out to minorities, to striking down barriers to free and open access.'' `` We will not tolerate discrimination, bigotry or bias of any kind _ period,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The president did not announce plans to visit sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this fall, despite earlier such speculation by White House officials. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated promises to work against poverty and racial intolerence, civil rights leaders attending the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> conference earlier suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s deeds have not always matched his words. Before hearing directly from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today, several prominent civil rights advocates said the president's record thus far has been weak, though they embraced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in achieving legislation extending civil rights protection to disabled Americans. `` The civil rights community would give the president high marks for accessibility and symbolism and rhetoric but low marks on substantive civil rights policy,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. Civil rights leaders cited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings limiting affirmative action, his veto of minimum wage legislation and his choice of black <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to be the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top civil rights enforcer. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on a 7-7 tie vote. Separately, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today that the president is still undecided on whether to resubmit <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' nomination during the current congressional recess _ a process that would temporarily sidestep the confirmation process `` No decision has been made,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Most civil rights groups have voiced opposition to <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' nomination, citing his alleged inexperience with civil rights law. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also suggested the president was not about to reverse his position that no new laws are necessary to seek to modify the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions. `` That's a decision that's already been made by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Civil rights leaders also fault the president's efforts to win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation to a federal judgeship for <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> attorney under fire for his membership in a club that excludes women; and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to undo existing school desegregation orders in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and its filing of a lawsuit challenging a Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, desegregation plan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the Urban League Conference: `` The challenge for urban <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a challenge for all of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... And it's a challenge I take to heart. Your problems are my problems. Your hopes -LRB- are -RRB- the hopes of all Americans. `` Today, I offer you my hand. I offer you my word. Together, we will make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> open and equal to all. `` Together, we will find a way to stop the decline of our inner cities _ to restore hope, and make the 90s a decade of urban renaissance,'' he added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he would not rest `` until I know I've done everything in my power to ensure that we succeed _ that every child in our inner cities has a shot at a good job, that every kid stays in school, gets a quality education, lives in decent housing _ in a neighborhood free of drugs, fear and violence.'' <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s congressional liaison and the highest ranking black member of the White House staff, said such episodes `` have in no way diminished the president's commitment on the civil rights front.'' Most of the civil rights movement's agenda `` is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s agenda,'' he said, adding that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s priority remains one of `` breaking down barriers, economic or otherwise. Urban League President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> challenged the president to use the speech `` to present bold new initiatives that help <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poor people and put us back on the path of racial progress.'' Civil rights leaders generally praise <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his `` offered hand'' approach, but fault him on his actions. `` Symbolism is important, but it's not enough,'' said <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Neas </PERSON> did applaud <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in helping to craft a bipartisan compromise _ reached last week _ on legislation extending civil rights laws to the nation's 37 million disabled people.

 An Arab gunman who infiltrated from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> wounded an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and held an off-duty soldier hostage for four hours today before being killed by Israeli troops, the army said. The siege ended when soldiers stormed a hut on the <PERSON> Kibbutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotan </PERSON> collective farm, 12 miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> resort city of <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION> and less than a mile from the <LOCATION> Jordan-Israel </LOCATION> border. In <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, a military spokesman was quoted as saying the attacker was a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> soldier who had abandoned his post. The Israeli army said the gunman, who carried an M-16 rifle, was apparently deranged. Hospital officials identified the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who was working as a volunteer at the kibbutz. They said she was slightly wounded by a bullet that passed through her neck. The hostage, <PERSON> Osnat </PERSON> <PERSON> Lev </PERSON>, was a member of an army unit made up of soldiers who live and work on collective farms. Ms. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> as saying the attacker shouted in English `` It's because of my brother!'' before opening fire on her, the soldier and a third woman in a date grove near the kibbutz. The third woman escaped. Soldiers stormed the hut in the date grove where the woman was held after attempting to negotiate with the Jordanian soldier for several hours, the radio said. It said his only demand during the negotiations was for a copy of the Koran, the Moslem holy book, which he was given. In <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, the military official identified the attacker as <PERSON> Farid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON>, a soldier, according to the official <ORGANIZATION> Petra </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The senior official, who was not identified, said the soldier `` carried out the attack on his own obviously.'' The initial attack came at 11:30 a.m. and the building was stormed about 3:30 p.m., the army said. `` A man dressed in military dress came out from behind one of the trees and shot one shot, and that was that,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was very, very lucky. I feel just fine.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> said the man kept mentioning a dead sister and asked the location of Israeli army bases that he could attack. `` He said all the time that his sister was killed, and why was she killed, and why I killed her. So I said I did not kill her at all. He said that the Jews killed her and now he comes to kill everybody,'' said the woman. She said she had worked as a volunteer on the kibbutz since June and would not be frightened away by the attack. She added she would probably stay at the kibbutz several more weeks. `` It's a very beautiful place even if things like this happen,'' she said. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> used the incident to point to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s efforts to fight terrorism. `` I believe it is time that the world will realize what is the difference when we talk about terrorism ... and all the sorts of atrocities they have carried out, and when the rest of the world talks about -LRB- it -RRB-, either from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` For us, fighting terrorism is a matter of night and day, a matter of life and death,'' he told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. When asked if the attack was by a guerrilla group, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> replied that it `` was an act by an individual,'' apparently a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> soldier. Ms. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> was rushed to <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yosef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> with a gunshot wound in the neck just where it meets the shoulder, hospital director <PERSON> Haim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoham </PERSON> said. About 60 to 70 people are believed to live at <LOCATION> Kibbutz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lotan </LOCATION>, which grows vegetables and dates. The last cross-border attack involving hostages was on March 7, 1988, when three <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas sneaked into southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and hijacked a commuter bus in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. They killed three hostages before being shot dead by police. In addition, nine Israelis, all workers at a nearby nuclear plant, were shot and wounded. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the attack, which Israeli officials said was aimed at sabotaging an American peace initiative by then-Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Two shooting incidents took place along the Jordanian border earlier this year. On May 27, a Jordanian soldier and an Israeli patrol exchanged fire across the border near <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shean </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The Jordanian was killed, and two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were wounded. In that incident, <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> also reported the Jordanian soldier had acted on his own after abandoning his post. On March 17, two gunmen killed an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier near <LOCATION> Hazeva </LOCATION>, 23 miles south of the <LOCATION> Dead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> later announced it captured several men in the same area. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION> group, a rebel offshoot of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility for that attack.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conveyed thanks Tuesday for <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s efforts on behalf of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages and asked his help in securing release of the body of American hostage <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed his gratitude in a meeting with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s new defense minister, <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabry </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Taleb </PERSON>. `` The phone calls were well received. ...

 Five Central American leaders have signed a plan to disband the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels by December, and President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to respect the Contras' `` death sentence.'' `` In this way the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can contribute to peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the Nicaraguan leader said Monday night upon returning to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> from a three-day summit at this Honduran beach resort. The plan was a sharp rebuff to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` generally supportive'' of the Central American leaders' agreement. However, he said any move to disband the Contras `` must be accepted by them voluntarily.'' Asked how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would react if <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> tried to drive the Nicaraguan rebels from its territory, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied, `` It's too early and unfair to say that the game is over.'' In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, opposition leaders said today the government should meet with the rebels to discuss how to carry out the plan. They called for continued talks with the internal opposition on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' pledge to carry out democratic reforms. `` The next step will be very arduous,'' said <PERSON> Silviano </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Sandinistas are not exactly known for fulfilling their commitments.'' The 120-day plan, laid out in a set of three accords signed Monday, set a 30-day deadline for a combined U.N.-Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> observer mission to organize itself and another 90 days for the Contras to demobilize. About 11,000 Contras and their 12,000 dependents living in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> along the Nicaraguan border are to be resettled, in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if they want and in other nations if not. <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> volunteered to take some in, though most would prefer to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In approving the plan, the five countries ignored <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lobbying to keep the Contras intact until after February elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Central to reaching an agreement appeared to be a Honduran decision that, after eight years, it wanted the rebels out. In the past, the government had denied the rebels were in the country, then called for them to leave but allowed them to stay. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of trying to block the accord, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and officials of other Central American nations denied the charge. Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> blamed the outcome on `` political confusion in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' `` This is a disaster for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> because it tried to impose its policy too late,'' said <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> in an interview with <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s Radio Impacto. Last-minute <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure `` had a counterproductive effect,'' he added. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had been lobbying to keep the Contras active until February's scheduled elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as a guarantee of the `` democratization'' that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s leftist government has promised. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he met with <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said he could not comment because he had not seen a text of the pact. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> noted that the <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> agreement, a Central American accord signed two years ago, says any <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> demobilization must be carried out under conditions of safety and democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and must be voluntary. `` I do n't think the Central American democracies would do anything to change the terms of the agreement that they have put forth,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. If the full 120 days from Monday were used, Dec. 5 would be the deadline for the new plan. The accords do not mention the consequences of any delay, but deadlines in previous Central American agreements have often been observed more in the breach. The Central American nations must `` find enough will to go along with the accords'' if they are to stick, said Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for initiating the regional peace process more than two years ago. It was not immediately clear whether the Contras are willing to surrender their arms, but assuming <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> lives up to its word the Contras would have no territory from which to operate. `` We have signed a death sentence for the Contras,'' said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. He called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to support the accords, cease `` aggression'' and lift its economic embargo on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Contras have been reduced to making sporadic attacks since last year, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off military aid. Non-lethal aid continues at a rate of $ 4.5 million a month, with the stipulation that it can be used for disbanding and resettling the Contras. `` This is a very difficult situation for the Nicaraguan people. We have been fighting for 10 years to achieve peace and democracy for our country and now we feel abandoned,'' Contra spokeswoman <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The Central American presidents agreed to ask the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to provide observers and verify the demobilization. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> already have volunteered to send observers under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices. The accords also call for a cease-fire in the 9-year-old Salvadoran civil war, but have no provisions for enforcement. The presidents had already agreed to dismantle the Nicaraguan rebels at a summit in February in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, but a 90-day deadline for working out the details passed without notice. In the meantime, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> set elections for Feb. 25 and obtained an agreement with his domestic opposition that undermined the Contras by calling for their dissolution. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s civil war has left 70,000 dead, according to independent estimates, while the Nicaraguan government says the conflict with the Contras has claimed at least 50,000 lives.

 A coven of witches has won tax exempt status in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> as a legitimate religious group. `` With this ruling, we witches will definitely be able to come out of the closet and take our place in society,'' said the coven's high priestess, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegrist </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> Tax Administrator <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said he overturned the state's initial ruling, that the Rosegate Coven did not qualify for a sales tax exemption, because it proved on appeal that it met the guidelines for legitimate church groups as set out by a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling Administrative Hearing Officer <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said Tuesday that she heard about 2 -LCB- hours of testimony in May and undertook extensive research on her own before recommending the action that <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> took on July 28. `` I'm happy that anyone who is practicing a religion in earnest is able to do so without state impediment,'' she said.

The core of the Wiccan worship is belief in a diety with male and female attributes, whose psychic energy can be tapped. Although the power can be used for good or ill will, witches do not use it for destructive purposes. When the tax exemption was denied last fall, the division's questions indicated tax officials were focusing on the apparent lack of formal theology schools for training Wiccan clergy, said <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> attorney who represented the witches in the administrative hearing in May He said officials also questioned the group's willingness to allow members to belong to other churches while claiming coven membership. That argument was rebutted when the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlburn </PERSON>, senior minister of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unitarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION>, testified that his church and many Eastern religions also permit members to belong to other faiths, <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. Under state laws, a religion must be a nonprofit group, not set up for the purpose of avoiding taxes. It must have a litany or system of prayer, as well as specific doctrines and practices that its members are expected to follow. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the connotation of `` witches'' may have made it more difficult for the state. `` If all the facts were identical and they were not called witches but were called brothers and sisters, for example, it probably would not have been anywhere nearly so'' controversial, he said. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said she did n't think the decision would set a precedent. `` This was very logical, very straightforward and very unemotional,'' she said, noting the coven is empowered by the state to officiate over marriage and burials.

 The European Community and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Tuesday signed an agreement to expand and strengthen trade and economic cooperation in the next five years. <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON>, a foreign affairs official of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, traveled to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> to sign a letter on an emergency food program for the financially strapped nation, said a spokesman for the 12-nation trading bloc. The spokesman, demanding anonymity, said <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON>' agenda called for talks with Polish authorities, including <PERSON> Ireneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekula </PERSON>, deputy prime minister, and <PERSON> Dominik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jastrzebski </PERSON>, minister of foreign economic cooperation, as well as officials of the Solidarity trade union. Negotiators for the community and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> reached agreement late last month on the trade and economic cooperation accord, which gives a five-year timetable for gradually lifting quotas and tariffs on a range of industrial and farm products. It also calls for greater cooperation in such fields as petrochemicals, construction, mining, energy, transportation, tourism and telecommunications. The trade agreement was the third between the Common Market trading bloc and an East European country since a thaw in relations a little more than a year ago. Accords also have been worked out with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The letter sets out some conditions for receipt of $ 120 million in free food the community will draw out of its surplus stocks and deliver soon to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which has been suffering from serious food shortages. The community wants to link the food shipments to changes in the structure of the Polish economy, such as in the inadequate system for getting food from farms to consumers' tables. The idea is to allow the Poles to sell the food to consumers and use the money for economic improvements. The Poles have accepted the plan, and the letter calls for creating a fund that often is used in development programs. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other world leaders attending an economic summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> urged emergency food shipments to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. They also called on the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to hold a high-level conference to come up with an economic aid plan for both <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Western officials held their first meeting on the aid plan last week. Other discussions were expected to be scheduled in the fall.

 Democrats had a 34-year lock on the congressional seat held by deposed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, but Saturday's special election could spell Republican. `` It's a race that we should n't lose, but we could lose,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>. Both parties call the election a toss-up. A poll published Sunday showed the leading Republican had 16 percent, the leading Democrat had 15 percent, with 64 percent not sure. <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, a Democratic political consultant and a former <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> aide, said Democrats, angry and disillusioned about <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s resignation during an ethics investigation, might not vote Both <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> and Day feel voters in the district are strong <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> supporters, and if they ca n't vote for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, they do n't want to bother to vote `` The ones that are maddest about it are really disillusioned about it,'' <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said. `` And they might just say to hell with it.'' All the better, say Republicans, who have been inching into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> government and now boast <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> among their ranks. But Republicans are n't exactly predicting victory. `` Clearly, we have an opportunity ... but the power of incumbency is great,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman. `` Whoever turns out their vote on election day is going to win.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> now is represented by nine Republicans and 20 Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Four Democrats, three Republicans and a <ORGANIZATION> Libertarian </ORGANIZATION> have filed for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s District 12 seat. The Democrats are <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Geren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Laraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> are the Republicans. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckingham </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, is the Libertarian. Because one candidate must get 51 percent of the vote to win, a runoff is expected. <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>, a physician who is host of the nationally syndicated television show `` 60 Second Housecall,'' and <PERSON> Geren </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> attorney, are considered the frontrunners, and were the two leaders in the recent poll results. Each has his party's endorsement, although <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> has important endorsements from labor and police. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who stepped down as speaker in May and later resigned his House seat in the face of an ethics investigation that turned up 69 instances of alleged rules violations, has not endorsed anyone. The district, which includes most of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, went for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984 and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in 1988. But Democrats say the district's traditional blue collar, conservative, voters who first sent <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1955 will continue to support their party. They are also counting on a backlash against the Republicans for the ouster of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the third-most powerful politician on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Geren </PERSON> has been blasting <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Republican <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> `` and his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> gang,'' as the group responsible for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s political demise. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> initiated the probe against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollern </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> GOP party leader has said, `` It was the Democrats who threw <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> out of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. If they had been willing to put their neck on the line to save him, they could have kept him, but the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was not willing to do that.'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, considered a distant second as a Democratic contender in the race, calls himself a `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON>,'' and is appearing with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s son on campaign stops. <PERSON> Petrovich </PERSON> is putting up billboards with the slogan `` To Protect Us,'' aimed at a city that fears losing everything it gained under <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s considerable influence. Republican Chairman <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> played down the possible effects of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s resignation on Republican candidates. `` People are going to vote for the candidate that will represent them the best in the future,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. `` The rest is history.'' On the other hand, Republican <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> has said in the campaign: `` If anyone did a good job, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did ... We should all strive to emulate him.''

 A hunter mauled and chewed by a wounded black bear managed to walk out of a forest and drive to a town for help, and a man who waded a river to safety after being attacked by a grizzly bear asked rescuers if his ears were still on. `` I could just hear his teeth grinding against my skull,'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordness </PERSON>, 39, said at <ORGANIZATION> Everett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. He was released Sunday after being treated for wounds on his head, hands and buttocks that required more than 100 stitches. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Covertson </PERSON>, 32, was in stable condition Tuesday at Fairbanks Memorial Hospital with 1,000 stitches piecing together his ripped scalp, face, neck and ankle. He underwent more than nine hours of surgery. Both men were attacked Saturday. <PERSON> Covertson </PERSON>'s family said he was attacked by a grizzly on his way out from checking on land he owns and was not armed. He told a paramedic that he did not hear the bear before it grabbed him. `` The bear had his head in its mouth and shook him,'' said <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Nord </PERSON> of the Cantwell Volunteer Ambulance. `` It left and came back and shook him again. ... He said he could hear the bones crunching.'' Covertson, of <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, waded the icy, swift <LOCATION> Chulitna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and fought his way through woods to the Parks Highway between <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> and Fairbanks. He collapsed in view of passing motorists, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballek </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION>, who took him to a gas station for help. `` He asked them whether his ears were still on,'' said the Balleks' daughter-in-law, <PERSON> Nena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballek </PERSON>. They were still attached. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON>, who helps operate the station, said <PERSON> Covertson </PERSON> was conscious and coherent. He said the bear opened up <PERSON> Covertson </PERSON>'s scalp above his left eye and tore it around the back of his head, in addition to several puncture wounds `` I do n't know how the guy made it, except he had to be in exceptionally good condition and have exceptional intestinal fortitude,'' <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON> said. Nordness, of <LOCATION> Clearview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said he shot a black bear in the <LOCATION> Beckler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Skykomish </LOCATION>, but the animal, which he estimated at 400 pounds, ran off into trees and thick brush. The state's bear season opened Aug. 1. Nordness, who was alone, went to a nearby campground to get help before going after the wounded animal. A young man he remembered only as <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> agreed to go with him. About an hour later, Nordness, carrying a .30 -06 caliber rifle, spotted the bear charging only a few feet to his left He fired point-blank into the bear's chest, but it kept coming and knocked him down. `` Oh God, make him stop, make him stop,'' Nordness said he thought as the bear stood on his back, tearing into him. Then <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> ran up, scaring the bear off. Despite his wounds, Nordness walked with <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> a quarter-mile to his car and drove himself to Skykomish for help. `` I wish I could find the bear that got me. I'd like to have that carcass for a rug,'' he said. `` It could be dead or it could be alive,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarvey </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>. He said hunters with dogs were not immediately able to find the bear. Campers were notified of the wounded animal and some decided to leave, <PERSON> Sarvey </PERSON> said. `` With the high brush, it would be foolish just to walk in there,'' he said.

<HEAD>Minor Parties Say They'll Consider Walesa Offer to Join Coalition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two parties linked to the ruling communists since the 1940s said Tuesday they will consider an invitation from Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to join a coalition government that would exclude the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But communist leaders, in their first comment on the <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> proposal, said it could lead to destabilizing the country. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, taking the political offensive Monday four days after the election of a communist premier, expressed opposition to any government formed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and said it would extend the party's 45-year monopoly on power. Instead, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, he would work for a coalition of Solidarity, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, putting the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the position of becoming a parliamentary opposition. In separate statements Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said their leaders would take the proposal under advisement. The communist Politburo, discussing the offer at its weekly meeting Tuesday, sharply criticized the proposal, according to state TV. Politburo members said it was aimed at breaking the traditional links between the communists and the Peasant and Democratic parties, and could undo the agreements reached between authorities and the opposition at talks in April, an announcer said on the main evening news program. `` It's another impediment by the opposition,'' according to the report of the Politburo discussion. `` The initiative showed by <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> creates the danger of opening up a government crisis, which certainly does not serve the stabilization of the situation in this country.'' Politburo members also `` pointed out that it complicates the quick formation'' of a government `` which the country needs so badly,'' state TV said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> press aides in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> said behind-the-scenes negotiations on forming a joint government have been going on since Thursday between Solidarity lawmakers and members of the Peasant and Democratic parties. The statement was an apparent rebuttal to <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON>, who Monday had criticized <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as publicizing his coalition proposal before presenting it to the involved parties. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, candidate of the communist <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was elected Aug. 3 by the Sejm, or parliament, to form the next government. Members of the Democratic and Peasant parties added their votes to the communists' to give him a 237-173 majority. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, a general who was interior minister for eight years, said it would take up to two weeks to assemble a Cabinet, which must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s proposal appears to have opened the road to an alternative scenario. `` The proposal put forward by ... <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> requires serious examination and decisions by appropriate statutory bodies of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It will be taken into account if the good of the national and the state requires this,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement carried on the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The statement, issued by party spokeswoman <PERSON> Elzbieta </PERSON> <PERSON> Otffinowska </PERSON>, mildly criticized <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s offer, saying: `` It is a pity that the proposal was not presented earlier.'' The proposal will be taken up Wednesday at a meeting of the party leadership and its 27 parliament deputies, it said. The <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it has stressed `` numerous times that only a grand coalition government can be an effective government, gain social credibility and carry the burden of leading the country out of the deep economic crisis.'' The phrase `` grand coalition'' has come to mean a coalition of Solidarity with the communists, something that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has rejected. But the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s statement said, `` <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s statement published in the mass media shall be considered by the -LRB- party -RRB- presidium. There has been no public response by <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> or the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> so far to the <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> proposition. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> has been rebuffed so far in trying to enlist Solidarity members in his Cabinet, and there is fear among authorities that a government formed with no Solidarity representation will lack public support. The concern has grown because of sharp increases in food prices last week and a series of wage disputes, mainly involving rail, bus and postal workers. `` Prospects are uncertain for creating a government capable, through its political and social influence, of effectively counteracting the dissolution of the economy,'' said a commentary Monday in the communist daily <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION>. `` Neither a government only of Solidarity or only of the party and the ruling coalition will fulful this requirement,'' it said. As a result of partially democratic elections in June, the communists hold 173 seats in the 460-member <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, Solidarity 161, the Peasants 76, the Democrats 27 and the remainder are held by pro-communist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> organizations. A 231-vote majority is needed to form a government. The Peasant and Democratic parties used to be rubber stamps for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In the changing political environment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, in which all parties expect to compete in four years in promised fully free elections, the allied parties have started to demonstrate greater independence.

<HEAD>Colleges Cut Intake of Students from Beijing; More Students Arrested</HEAD>

 Colleges nationwide are cutting the number of high school graduates they will accept from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, an official newspaper said Tuesday in a report on another apparent effort to prevent more student arrest. Also on Tuesday, more reports of arrests from the spring student pro-democracy protests trickled into the capital. A report in the <ORGANIZATION> Hebei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said seven <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> student leaders and other alleged counterrevolutionaries were arrested last month in <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION>. The province surrounds <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and many students fled there after the military crackdown to crush their pro-democracy movement. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said colleges have cut by 1,148 the number of high school graduates they will accept from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. It quoted <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Huangguo </PERSON>, deputy chief of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, as saying colleges had adjusted their admissions to compensate for over-enrollment in some majors. Students do not select their majors, but are assigned to departments regardless of personal preference. A more likely explanation is that out-of-town colleges fear students from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> may cause political unrest on their campuses. Many <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> middle school students joined in the protests led by college students that were crushed by the army June 3-4. The government already has said that the college freshman class nationwide will be cut by 30,000 students, to 610,000. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> colleges that led the student movement will have their freshman classes cut in half or more in a move that school officials say is a result of the protests. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> also said admission of new students will take place 24 days later than usual, in early October. All students except freshmen are scheduled to return to most <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> schools in mid - or late August for several weeks of political education and to finish classwork from the spring term, which was cut short by the protests The <ORGANIZATION> Hebei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> carried the arrest report July 12, but it only was seen in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> today. It identified those arrested as leaders of independent student unions that organized the protests. Also detained, it said, were two leaders of worker and citizen support groups, five people accused of attacking soldiers who put down the protests and an unspecified number of other protesters. Nearly 2,100 arrests have been reported nationwide, but most such reports stopped in mid-July and thousands more people are believed to have been arrested secretly.

 An undercover police officer watched a group of men rape a suspected prostitute but did not interfere because he did not want to blow his cover, according to newspaper reports.

 Students enrolled in certain high school English classes got credit for never picking up a book except to deliver or store it, according to a teacher who blew the whistle Tuesday. The Daily News reported that `` ghost classes'' at <ORGANIZATION> Adlai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevenson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the borough of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> had titles such as `` Literature and Art,'' but consisted mainly of students running errands for teachers. `` There was no classroom to go to,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairclough </PERSON>, a teacher for 18 years, told News columnist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>. `` The kids were used as gofers.'' <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobrino </PERSON> acknowledged Tuesday that allegations of ghost classes at <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> were under investigation and that Inspector General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofarelli </PERSON> had completed a draft report. Until it has been reviewed by the board, he said, `` we're just not going to be making any comment.'' <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> quoted from an affidavit that was part of the evidence compiled by <PERSON> Sofarelli </PERSON>, in which a 1988 <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> graduate said she took the `` Literature and Art'' honors course as a senior. `` This course consisted of delivering books to English teachers and storing books in the book room. I also opened up the computer room and delivered lessons to the substitute teachers. And sometimes I delivered messages to the teachers themselves,'' she said. The student, now in college, received a score of 90 for her work in the course. <PERSON> Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>, a teachers' union spokesman, said the `` Literature and Art'' class, intended to be an independent study course, was eliminated last October after the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> filed a grievance. He said he did not know if the administration or individual teachers were to blame for the abuses. <ORGANIZATION> UFT </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said in a statement that the union had been trying to stamp out phantom classes at <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> for years. The News said there were similarly phony classes for students who needed remedial English. `` One of the transcripts shows that a kid who was a couple of years behind in his reading got a 90 in both the reading tutor class and the advanced Literature and Art class,'' <PERSON> Fairclough </PERSON> said. `` Why would a kid who was behind in his reading be in an advanced literature class?'' The school is holding summer school classes now and none of the regular staff, including principal <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, will be back until late August, school officials said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> professor alleged to have applied for more than 100 broadcast licenses using false names or forgeries. Outgoing <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> sent a letter last week to the department asking for an investigation of <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boozer </PERSON>, of Central Square, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION>. After a yearlong investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> decided that <PERSON> Boozer </PERSON> may have violated both commission regulations and federal law. `` It appears that on numerous occasions, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boozer </PERSON> signed the names of attorneys and other persons without their knowledge,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said in the letter, to Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` Accordingly, I am hereby referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> the report of the commission's investigation for consideration of whether criminal prosecution of the responsible individual or individuals is warranted.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, who was appointed by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in February 1987, left office Monday. His letter to <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> was dated Aug. 4. <PERSON> Boozer </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Tuesday. There was no telephone number listed under his name in Central Square. <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Oswego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Boozer </PERSON> is an assistant professor of health and physical education, and used to be the school's basketball coach. He has been on sabbatical since last September, she said, adding that she did not know where he was or when he is slated to return. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said she had no comment on the allegations. <PERSON> Boozer </PERSON> first applied for a license for an FM radio station in <LOCATION> Ilion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, but was found in 1985 to be unqualified, according to <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chew </PERSON>. He is accused of then beginning a series of false applications for television and radio station construction permits that swamped the FCC. The commission launched a formal investigation into <PERSON> Boozer </PERSON>'s actions Aug. 4, 1988. According to the <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> -RRB- Post-Standard, competing applicants have agreed to pay <PERSON> Boozer </PERSON> and others about $ 130,000 in out-of-court settlements to avoid expensive legal battles over applications.

 Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, trying to bolster his campaign against the use of federal money for offensive art, has sent fellow lawmakers four photographs that he considers obscene. `` I suggest you take a look at the enclosed materials,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said in the one-paragraph letter accompanying photographs from a current art exhibit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It's your call as to whether the taxpayers' money should be used to fund this sort of thing.'' The photos were taken by the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>, whose work is on display at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Project for the Arts, which decided to show the exhibition after it was canceled by the Corcoran Gallery of Art. The Corcoran wanted to avoid becoming involved in a political battle over congressional financing of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> provided one of the grants to underwrite a national tour of `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>: The Perfect Moment,'' which included homoerotic and sadomasochistic pictures. The photographs mailed by <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, from the <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> exhibit, include `` Man in a Polyester Suit, 1980'' and `` <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, Mr. 10 1 @ 2, 1976,'' which both show male genitals, one of a young girl who is partially exposed and one of a young boy standing naked on a chair. The direct object of <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' wrath is the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION>, which provided $ 30,000 to underwrite part of the <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> exhibition and tour. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> recently approved a Helms amendment that bans using federal funds for material that is considered `` obscene or indecent'' or `` denigrates, debases or reviles'' beliefs or people on the basis of religion, race, creed, sex, handicap, age or national origin. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittees on the interior will meet in September on the $ 170 million NEA budget. In advance of that conference, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> sent the photographs and letter. A random check with congressional staff found that although the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offices had received the letter and photographs from <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, most of the senators and members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had not seen them. The letter was marked `` for member's eyes only,'' and during the monthlong August recess many lawmakers are in their home states. Although personal and urgent mail is forwarded to members, most congressional aides said the Helms package would likely remain on their bosses' desks until they return. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' recent actions are not new. In April 1988, the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> senator introduced an amendment to the AIDS research and education bill renewing an expiring 1987 ban on federal money for educational materials that promote or encourage homosexual activity. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' amendment was prompted by a gay-oriented AIDS education videotape that he screened for several senators. `` There's something wrong when federal tax dollars are used for this garbage,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said at the time. The amendment passed 94-2, but later senators approved a measure saying that nothing in the bill should prevent dissemination of accurate information to people at risk. The later amendment effectively superseded the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' measure.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> appealed Tuesday for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to free the Lebanese Shiite cleric it abducted, but Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> rejected his release except as part of a prisoner exchange. In separate news conferences following an hour-long meeting in <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s office, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> disagreed sharply over the wisdom of the abuction of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> from his south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> home on July 28. `` I have to say that the kidnapping of <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> does not help,'' said <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, who reiterated <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s earlier pleas that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> free the clergyman. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> would be held until <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was able to swap him for 16 foreign hostages and three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers captured in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1986. `` We believe that after three and a half years ... of trying to bring about an exchange that failed, we had to have assets that will convince them -LRB- Shiites -RRB- to bring about an exchange and hopefully end the phenomenon of keeping hostage Israelis and non-Israelis,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has received no response through the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to its offer to swap <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> for the missing <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He added: `` I will not relate myself to whatever comes on the media in the name of fake names of Shiite organizations in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s swap offer has been rejected in statements issued in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in the name of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, militia and various factions of the group. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Tuesday described <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s efforts to retrieve its missing soldiers as a national `` moral commandment. He told a graduation ceremony for army officers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was committed `` to do everything possible in order to bring back the soldiers imprisoned by the bands of enemies.'' <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> is on the final part of a week-long tour of the region, which also took him to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for talks with political and militia leaders. He was sent to try to determine the fate of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was serving with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer force in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> when he was kidnapped in February 1988. The Hezbollah-affiliated faction holding <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> released a videotape July 31 purporting to show him hanged. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it believes the body shown in the tape was <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> but that there can be no positive identification without physical evidence. It offered no information about the time or cause of death. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> believed <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> died last year as a result of mistreatment, according to sources who demanded anonymity. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> said that in his talks in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, `` I was unable to establish exactly when he died. Opinions differ about that.'' Asked if he was satisfied with findings showing <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was dead, <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> said, `` I have seen the findings of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, who have professional forensic scientists who examined the evidence and reached that conclusion.'' <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> declined comment when asked if he had relayed a message from <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> spiritual leader <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. After an earlier meeting with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> was asked about reports in the Jerusalem Post that another American hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, might be released soon as a `` goodwill gesture.'' <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> said he had no information that this was the case. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, who was threatened with death until the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervened with an international diplomatic offensive, worked at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>. He has been a captive since Sept. 12, 1986. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> said he would meet with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general Wednesday to report on his trip. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said Tuesday's meeting took place at <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>'s request and that he had given the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official what information <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had on <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. He said he also described <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` moral and practical commitment'' to bringing home soldiers missing in action. `` We would like to turn our achievement _ having <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> in our hands _ to an end of the hostage episode for Israelis and Westerners. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the next step in the process should be receiving a report on the health of the three missing Israeli servicemen. They are soldiers <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rahamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsheikh </PERSON>, captured Feb. 17, 1986, in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` security zone'' in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, a navigator whose plane went down over southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Oct. 16, 1986.

<HEAD>Labor Decides to Stay in Cabinet, Adopts Land for Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The governing body of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday decided to stay in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ruling coalition and adopted the principle of trading land for peace to guide peace talks with Palestinians. The massive show of hands that concluded the meeting of the party's 1,350-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> put an end to the government crisis that erupted July 5 over hard-line conditions for peace talks adopted by the rival right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s party decided on that day the government's program for Palestinian elections in the occupied territories could only be implemented on condition the 20-month Palestinian uprising ends. The plan calls for negotiating an interim self-rule period with elected representatives of the 1.7 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> also demanded continuation of Jewish settlement in the occupied territories and said no land would be traded for peace. It said 140,000 Arabs living in the annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> would not be allowed to vote, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> decided. On July 10, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership bureau voted in favor of leaving the government. But on July 23, the Cabinet reaffirmed the Israeli peace plan without the Likud-adopted principles, turning Tuesday's pre-scheduled Labor meeting into a largely ceremonial event Labor leader and Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, however, told the delegates the party would leave the governing coalition if the peace process stops. `` I'm convinced that we are taking the right path to stay in the government as long as the peace process continues and to leave it if it ends,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, an architect of the peace initiative, said it was important to prove to the Palestinians the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` is not accepting silently'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s conditions. But others, known as Labor doves, opposed the decision, urging the hawks such as <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> to reconsider it. `` The only thing -LRB- Labor -RRB- is doing is being a moderate mask for the government,'' said legislator <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON>. In what appeared to be a compromise between the Labor hawks and doves and a move to counter the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> `` principles,'' the party adopted 12 points to guide the peace process, including willingness to trade territory for peace. The guiding points also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not annex the lands it has occupied since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war but would not agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state there either. `` We do not want to annex the territories. That would mean to live with perpetual uprising, who knows for how many generations,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. The Labor plan said east Jerusalem Arabs would be allowed to vote, but outside <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and stressed that <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> would stay `` undivided and united under Israeli sovereignty.'' Another point called for suspension of Jewish settlements once talks aimed at elections start and said the issue would become part of subsequent negotiations. Responding to another Likud demand, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> said elections should start `` without preconditions.'' Negotiations for elections would run parallel with efforts to quell the uprising, which has claimed at least 530 Palestinian and 38 Israeli lives. Labor also appeared to open a door for some <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation by saying that `` Palestinians from outside'' can participate in the talks on the final status of the occupied lands on condition their candidacy is agreed upon by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and local Palestinians. Other Labor points seemed aimed at answering some <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> demands. They guaranteed free and democratic elections monitored by foreign observers and said that after the balloting, Palestinians would receive political rights. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has rejected the Israeli program, saying free elections were impossible under occupation and demanding that elections lead to an independent Palestinian state with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as its capital.

 Here is a transcript of the statement delivered at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday by Marine Maj. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, wife of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, believed executed by terrorists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>: Yesterday afternoon the commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, General <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, advised me of the virtual certainty that my husband, Colonel <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, is dead. Shortly thereafter, I received a telephone call from the president, who graciously offered his support and his sympathy. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in the service of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> because he believed he could be useful, that he could help and that he was needed. He always needed to fulfill a destiny, a need based on a profound sense of duty. He wrote in his high school year book his goal was to `` Always make my family proud of me.'' He suceeded. Those of us who have known <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> count ourselves lucky. He taught us how to love and enjoy life. He taught us tolerance for those whose ideas differed from ours. He taught us that words such as honor, reputation, integrity and fidelity have real meaning. To those who would suggest that our concern for <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> should somehow be mitigated because he was in a dangerous business or because his act of volunteering was supposedly foolish, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> himself would have the appropriate reply, `` When you're out front, people will shoot at you.'' Now is not the time for anger or bitterness, for recriminations and blame. Now is the time for calm reflection, for kind thoughts of the man who brought us togther. Now is the time to tell <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> that we love him and we miss him. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> would be proud of the fact that our commandant had the courage and the decency to inform me personally of the sad news. He has been a pillar of support from the beginning. I am also mindful of the fact that our president has agonized in a very profound and personal manner over my husband's fate. He has my prayers and my support as he tries to save the living and end the suffering. Thank you.

 A man pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges he set fire to his pregnant 17-year-old daughter, who delivered a healthy baby hours later despite having burns over most of her body. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON>, 41, was indicted by a <LOCATION> Summit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury last week on charges of felonious assault, child endangering and aggravated arson.

 The county supervisors have voted not to replace courthouse water fountains labeled `` colored'' and `` white,'' but to give them a historical plaque. The decision Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> board of supervisors rejected an offer by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> and History to move the fountains to the state history museum in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and build replicas that would not remind visitors of past segregation laws. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> is not satisfied with the decision that the board of supervisors made. It was just a sign to let the whole state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> know that racism is alive in <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Laurel-Jones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` It is a very strong possibility that we will be out marching at the <LOCATION> Ellisville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> this week or the first of next week. I am prepared to wear out three pairs of shoes,'' he said Tuesday. Under pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, county officials in April daubed plaster over the labels. But rain quickly rinsed the plaster away. Vandals also sprayed the white fountain with black paint. County Supervisor <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, the only black member of the board, was the lone voice Monday for accepting the state's offer. `` This situation has apparently reached an unappropriate level of racial overtones. It is the wording that makes the difference on the fountains,'' <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said. County Supervisor <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Holifield </PERSON> proposed instead that the fountains be cleaned of the plaster and marked by a plaque explaining their historical significance. The motion passed with only <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> objecting and County Supervisor <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Dykes </PERSON> abstaining. `` I do n't think this is going to solve it,'' <PERSON> Dykes </PERSON> said. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> and History must approve any alterations to the fountains because the 82-year-old courthouse is a state historic landmark.

 A man held in jail for a year and two days without a trial or hearing says he found the time enlightening. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashlor </PERSON>, 54, was freed Monday when <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> County </PERSON> <PERSON> Jail </PERSON> officials learned of his illegal detention because jail personnel raised questions about his long stay. <PERSON> Bashlor </PERSON>'s jail time violated state laws requiring arraignment within three days and trial within 180 days of arrest. District Court Judge <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> dismissed two misdemeanor charges and released him. `` It appears there was some kind of breakdown in communications,'' sheriff's spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouradian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ivie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, named <PERSON> Bashlor </PERSON>'s lawyer, said his client `` just plain got overlooked.'' <PERSON> Bashlor </PERSON> said he had no plans to sue. `` I have no grudges against anybody,'' he said. `` They treated me all right. I had a cell to myself and I read a lot. `` You know, some people say that everyone should spend a year in jail. It takes about a year to really get a kind of enlightenment.'' <PERSON> Bashlor </PERSON> was arrested Aug. 5, 1988, on misdemeanor warrants for assault and trespass. He was arraigned in 36th District Court and taken to the jail, but due to a mixup was n't returned to court for a scheduled pretrial appearance. The court thought he had jumped bond and issued an arrest warrant. With no further hearings scheduled, the jail had no court order to remove him from his cell. Without a court appearance, no lawyer was appointed. <PERSON> Bashlor </PERSON> spent 367 days in the jail, never tried or convicted of charges that would have carried a maximum penalty of 90 days. `` I tried to tell them I should n't be there, but that does n't really work in jail,'' he said

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would be willing to help free American hostages if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> released $ 2 billion in frozen Iranian assets, a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> newspaper said Tuesday. Lebanese news reports said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> might try to help gain the release of the captives. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, the Iranian-sponsored group thought to be an umbrella for hostage holders, said it would not trade three captured <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers for a kidnapped <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> cleric <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has refused to free on other terms. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> appealed to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to release the 33-year-old cleric, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, but Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> refused. Israeli commandos kidnapped <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, who is affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, from his home in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on July 28. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has offered to exchange <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> prisoners it holds, estimated at about 400, for the three soldiers and the 16 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, eight of whom are Americans. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tofaili </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> leader, said in a statement distributed Tuesday in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>: `` There shall be no contacts and no negotiations as long as <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> remains in captivity. `` This is the party's unshakeable conviction and this is what we shall do. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is not concerned with the question of the hostages or the negotiations revolving around it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, has insisted <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> be freed without conditions. The <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted a source close to President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as saying: `` The first step should be taken by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and if <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> gets satisified that its assets will certainly be unfrozen, then the second step will definitely come from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' In the newspaper report, carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the source said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s influence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was limited and there was no guarantee the hostages would be released. The Iranian assets, including arms purchased by the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> but not delivered, were frozen when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> broke relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> over the seizure of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in 1979, after the shah was overthrown. Some of the Americans in the embassy were held hostage for 444 days. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` There are a lot of ideas being floated, a lot of exchanges being made. ... We see ideas coming out from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, everybody.'' <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> repeated pleas by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> free the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> cleric, and told reporters after meeting <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>: `` I have to say that the kidnapping of <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> does not help.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said at another news conference: `` We believe that after 3 -LCB- years ... of trying to bring about an exchange -LRB- for the soldiers -RRB- we had to have assets ... to bring about an exchange and hopefully end the phenomenon of keeping hostage Israelis and non-Israelis.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s spiritual adviser, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, said in a statement published by several <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers Tuesday that the abduction of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> left `` the region poised on a powder keg.'' `` That act of piracy led to the killing of American officer <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, referring to the announcement by the captors of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> that they hanged him July 31 in retaliation. A poor-quality videotapepe the kidnappers released showed the body of a man that appeared to be the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> hanging from a gallows. Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> she considered her husband dead, and offered President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> her support as he `` tries to save the living and end the suffering.'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> major, said the time had come to tell her husband `` we love him and miss him.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it believed the man on the gallows was <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, but that when or and how he died could not be determined. There have been reports that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who was on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> duty when he was seized in February 1988, was killed months ago. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s refusal to free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval movements in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, reminded him of tension that preceded <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982. `` I do not rule out the possibility of a large-scale military operation by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to get itself off the hook in this crisis which it created,'' he declared. An-Nahar, an independent <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper, said Tuesday there were indications <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would `` coordinate and intensify efforts to resolve the hostage issue and defuse the crisis it generated.'' `` This is expected to take its final shape when Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> arrives in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> soon for talks with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s government,'' said a dispatch from its <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> correspondent. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> supported <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during its 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, in which a truce was reached in August 1988, but their interests in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> sometimes conflict. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and is the country's main power broker. <PERSON> An-Nahar </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was among the countries President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked to intervene after kidnappers holding <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> threatened to kill him, `` but <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> rejected the contents of the -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- letter because they did not conform with the role it had played, and is playing now, to secure the release of hostages.'' `` This prompted <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to send a flexible explanation of the letter to <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> officials after a major crisis was about to arise between the two countries over the letter's contents,'' it said. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s kidnappers, who call themselves the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday they had suspended the death sentence against him. He was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>U.N. Mission Inspects Major Evacuation Route</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> team studying the feasibility of forming a body to monitor <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s troop pullout from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> traveled Tuesday over what is expected to be one of the major evacuation routes. After its drive, the team met with officials of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, even though it had been widely expected to work only in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> Team members would not give details of the talks. The team, sent by an international peace conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, drove six hours over Highway No. 1 from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s major southern city of <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION>, where the talks were held. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> claims to have made annual partial troop pullouts since 1982, and many of the departing soldiers returned home on Highway No. 1. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference, which opened July 30, is trying to find a political settlement to the war that erupted with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> plans to withdraw its last troops in September, leaving the government it installed in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> to fight a coalition of three guerrilla groups. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference agreed that this pullout must be internationally verified. The pro-Vietnamese government previously had rejected any <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> role in the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> peace process because the world body recognizes the guerrillas' resistance coalition as the legitimate government. The 15-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team, mostly military officers, gave few details of its mission, saying it first has to report to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary general. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vadset </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the leader of the team, said it met with a vice minister of defense of the Vietnamese-installed government Monday, when it arrived in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> to begin its mission. `` We were received extremely well and had short but good discussions,'' he told reporters, who accompanied the team on the flight back from <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. `` There was no politics involved. We merely addressed the practical aspects,'' he said. The team was to meet Wednesday with <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, premier of the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government, and four Cabinet ministers. The team, from 11 countries, includes experts in communications, aviation and other technical fields.

<TEXT>
 Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Tuesday he thinks President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doing a better job than his two predecessors of dealing with a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> hostage crisis. But the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> also warned that if terrorists carry out their threat to murder hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will use military retaliation. If <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> is murdered, `` All bets are off,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Then you would see a military response.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, at a news conference, praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for using intensive diplomatic pressures from at least 12 nations in an attempt to resolve the situation that led to the apparent murder of hostage Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> by <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The president `` is using every channel,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who said he was briefed last week by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. Among nations applying diplomatic pressure are <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said. `` I really believe there is some optimism,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` I've talked to the president about this a number of times. He attributed his optimism to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s steady approach and the more moderate tone adopted by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new president. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> earlier had criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for not notifying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that it planned to abduct a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> cleric from his home in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He did n't repeat that criticism Tuesday, saying instead he thinks `` the Israelis are under some pressure.''

 Female companionship and winks and nods were used by a defunct savings and loan to curry favor with regulatory officials, a federal prosecutor said Tuesday at the fraud trial of a president of the association. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> made thousands of dollars in political contributions and payments for prostitutes and then were reimbursed with phony bonus checks and false business vouchers, said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Haugberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> President <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> took part in the scheme by approving expenditures of more than $ 55,000 from thrift funds. King is charged in a 37-count indictment with conspiring to defraud the government and misapply Vernon funds. The indictment alleges that he used thrift money to make illegal political contributions to several congressmen, including former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> As opening statements began Tuesday in King's trial, his attorney, <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> King </PERSON> was a victim of government prosecutors and said they had harassed witnesses into implicating King. Prosecutors said they will call several Vernon officials who already have pleaded guilty to various charges. <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON> said he will show during the trial that <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> owner <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> took pain to ensure that <PERSON> King </PERSON> did not know about the illegal payments. No criminal charges have been filed against <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. Vernon Savings was closed by federal regulators in November 1987, with losses totaling more than $ 1.3 billion. King was deputy commissioner with the state thrift regulatory agency before joining <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>. The witnesses will describe the `` nuts and bolts and also the winks and nods, the tacit understandings'' of the transactions, <PERSON> Haugberg </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, responding to the increasingly international nature of crime, announced plans Tuesday to create an Office Of International Affairs in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Often more than 50 percent of my day is devoted to some matter related to our international involvement in fighting drug trafficking, money laundering, international organized crime and business fraud, environmental depredations, terrorism or espionage,'' the attorney general said in remarks prepared for delivery in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he would ask permission from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to create the office to coordinate the department's dealings with foreign governments on law enforcement issues. The attorney general said the plan was based on dramatic increase in international law enforcement activities since he headed the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division in during the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration. `` Upon my return to the department, the biggest single change that I noticed was the vast increase in the amount of international activiity in which we are now engaged,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The office will report directly to the attorney general. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has long said he wanted to make the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> more responsive to the increasing international nature of crime. `` This is an area, I believe, where we have not kept up with the times,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` Crime is no longer limited by the distance one pony can cover in a day's time, and a businessman's primary market is no longer that which is within a wagon's ride,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>No `Greater Evil' Defense in Operation Rescue Trespassing Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Operation Rescue leader <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and four other anti-abortionists can not argue during their trespassing trial that they were trying to prevent the greater evil of murder when they blockaded a clinic, a judge ruled Tuesday. `` There can not be any way in which it can be shown that the abortions were stopped that day. This is going to be a case of trespassing, conspiracy to trespass and obstruction of a business,'' Municipal Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Paez </PERSON> said. Defense attorney <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Zal </PERSON> had asked <PERSON> Paez </PERSON> to allow him to use the `` necessity defense,'' arguing a law was broken during the March 25 blockade in order to prevent greater harm. `` There are hearts that are still beating today because of the actions my client took,'' <PERSON> Zal </PERSON> said Monday. But the judge said Tuesday he would n't allow expert testimony on the viability of a fetus, saying that question was left to the Legislature. `` I think the law at the time and now is that a woman has the right to an abortion up to ... 24 weeks,'' <PERSON> Paez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McMonagle </PERSON>, 36, both from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennette </PERSON>, 35, of <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viejo </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppink </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> are each charged with two counts of conspiracy and one count each of resisting arrest, blocking an entrance, failing to disperse and violating a court order. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, <PERSON> McMonagle </PERSON> and White are acting as their own attorneys. `` Can any pro-lifer in this country get a fair trial? Our defense is gutted right in the forefront. Our defense of why we were there is that we were saving human lives,'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said. The decision allows jury selection to go forward in what is expected to be a month-long trial. The five defendants were among 771 demonstrators arrested last spring for blocking the entrances of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-area </LOCATION> women's clinics as part of a crusade against abortion The city attorney's office says it is prepared to prosecute 539 other anti-abortion demonstrators, trying them in groups of 15 to 20. The remaining 232 originally arrested pleaded guilty and were sentenced to probation.

<HEAD>Military Warns Pilots Not to Bomb Bird Sanctuary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Military pilots across <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> risk losing their wings if they bomb a bird sanctuary during aerial target practice over <PERSON> Noman </PERSON>'s Land, a pristine island three miles off <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has been using the deserted island as a bombing target since World War II. Nowadays, pilots from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> drop sand-filled dummy bombs and smoke markers on the western tip of <PERSON> Noman </PERSON>'s Land. They no longer use live explosives, but some have reportedly violated an order to stay away from the rest of the island, where grassy knolls, marshes and unspoiled beaches provide a haven for wildlife. <ORGANIZATION> Peregrine </ORGANIZATION> falcons rest there during their annual migration from <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Rare short-eared owls and snowy eaglets, black crowned night herons and northern harriers, better known as marsh hawks, all flourish where tourists are banned. And the clear ponds shelter an elusive species of spotted turtle, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, director of the state's endangered species program. The F-111s and A-10s have been ordered to keep away from the northeast corner of the island, where the birds like to nest on a rocky point. But two weeks ago, a citizen in the Gay Head area of <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard spotted a military jet over the sanctuary, said <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, a biologist who runs the <ORGANIZATION> Felix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanctuary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> and has been inspecting <PERSON> Noman </PERSON>'s Land since 1973 Based on the report and a visit to the island, Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuchinski </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the new commander of the Naval Air Station in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION>, has again put pilots on notice to stay clear of both the sanctuary and the cliffs of Gay Head, which are dotted with secluded million-dollar homes, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said Tuesday. <PERSON> Kuchinski </PERSON> told The Patriot Ledger of Quincy Monday that any <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilots found bombing over the sanctuary could be stripped of their wings. `` These pilots are in combat aircraft and are pretty proficient,'' he said. `` The island is big and the pilots know -LRB- the target area. -RRB- I'm sending a message today to remind everyone we are watching.'' `` This is the only target site in the whole <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> area,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON>, the second-in-charge at the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION> base. French, who accompanied <PERSON> Kuchinski </PERSON> and others on the island tour last week, said he saw no signs that practice bombs had been dropped in the sanctuary. The orange bombs, which range from 25 pounds to 500 pounds, are clearly visible in the grass around the targets on the western side of the island, he said. `` That does n't mean there were n't any -LRB- bombs inside the sanctuary -RRB-, but it does indicate to me that it's not common practice,'' French said. Over the years, the military use of <PERSON> Noman </PERSON>'s Land has drawn fire from some naturalists and drawn anti-military protesters to fields where none but sheep have lived for nearly 80 years. But French and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> said the military presence has in fact been kinder to the creatures of <PERSON> Noman </PERSON>'s Land than campers and picnickers would be. `` Certainly it sounds bad when you talk about bombing the island,'' French said. `` It has a nasty ring to it. ... But frankly it's protected the island a lot more than the other ways we protect open space. Even passive public use makes a lot of our sites unattractive to wildlife.'' `` As long as the pilots obey the rules and use the target areas and use the proper approach pattern, then the island is alive and well,'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> said.

It did not, however, mention <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>'s open letter expressing support for a petition for democratic reforms or his offer to mediate amid increasing attacks by the authorities on the opposition. <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> officials lashed out again Tuesday at activists who circulated a petition for democratic reform, alleging they are trying to stir up unrest. <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>, 90, made his offer to mediate in an open letter Aug. 4, in an apparent attempt to defuse tension over the forthcoming 21st anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, emigre sources said Monday. `` Today, an increasing number of citizens are demanding a share in the domestic responsibility for the state of society by signing the petition ` Several Sentences' and, to this end, are even prepared to pay the price of personal sacrifice,'' the cardinal's letter said The petition has been signed by 15,000 people, including some <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members. Sources close to the cardinal who insisted on anonymity said the meeting with <PERSON> Lucan </PERSON> `` took place in a very noble and smooth atmosphere,'' but declined to say whether the meeting produced any concrete agreements or give other details. Rude Pravo said only that <PERSON> Lucan </PERSON> `` appreciated the cardinal's interest in current developments in our society and the solution of open questions. In a separate article, the daily quoted officials as criticizing the petition and its authors. A co-sponsor of the petition, <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON>, was arrested Monday at his home in <LOCATION> Gottwaldov </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moravia </LOCATION>. He was arrested twice earlier this year on charges of anti-state activity, but released both times after staging hunger strikes. Communist Party ideologist <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON> called the petition `` a flop,'' Rude Pravo reported. The <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> leadership repeatedly has denounced the petition and said those signing it face fines or imprisonment. The criticism is part of a barrage of propaganda against opposition groups prior to the Aug. 21 anniversary of the 1968 invasion, when renewed anti-government protests are expected. Six of the activists who sponsored the petition have been told they are under investigation and police have searched houses and done repeated document checks on dissidents in recent days. In an interview with Rude Pravo and the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, the chief investigator of the national security corps, <PERSON> Jaroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Spura </PERSON>, said he had proof the petition aimed `` to stir up unrest, provoke acts of pressure and violate public order.'' <PERSON> Spura </PERSON> said his investigation was not finished but it already was clear the petition's supporters sought `` to overthrow the socialist system in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.'' He quoted from a letter allegedly written by veteran activist <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON> to banned playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>. It was not clear how authorities obtained the letter, and its authenticity could not be confirmed. <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON>'s telephone has been cut off by police and <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> has been ordered by authorities to stay out of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was detained twice last week, once for three hours and the second time for 11 hours. About 10,000 people took part in unofficial demonstrations last year to mark the 20th anniversary of the invasion. Other anti-government protests took place in October, January and May when police used force to disperse crowds. <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> voiced his concern about further violence in his letter. `` As a herald of peace I have the duty to warn against violence,'' he said. He also called on authorities and the opposition to meet.

 An automobile left running in the basement garage of an apartment house has been blamed for the deaths of three elderly people, police said Tuesday.

Police Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scego </PERSON> said the ignition of <PERSON> Zahm </PERSON>'s car in the garage below the apartments was on when it was inspected and the vehicle's battery was dead, leading investigators to believe the engine had been left running.

 In the quiet Pleasure Lake community, where houses and mobile homes cluster around a fish pond crowded with cypress, some neighbors had a feeling something was wrong at the secondhand <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> trailer. The 13-year-old girl who lived there with her mother, stepfather and four brothers could sometimes be heard crying, `` Stop it,'' one neighbor said. She was seldom allowed out, said another, except to borrow food and cigarettes. Then, last month, `` the little girl walked across the street and told my adopted granddaughter that she had to talk to someone,'' said neighbor <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>. `` I could tell she had been crying.'' After she told her story, child welfare authorities came to pick up the girl and a few hours later investigators arrested her stepfather and four brothers on 46 counts, including child molestation. `` We do n't work a case every day where the victim's own siblings are involved,'' <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Musick </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Constitution </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is the first time I can remember when we've arrested every male in the family'' on molestation charges. Arrested were <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 39, the girl's stepfather, and her four brothers _ <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Medlin </PERSON>, 21; <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Medlin </PERSON>, 19; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Medlin </PERSON>, 17; and a 16-year-old whose name was withheld. When <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> talked to the girl last month, `` she said her older brother had kept her in bed all day and that he had laid out of work because she would be home alone,'' he recalled. Neighbors said she did not have a key to the trailer, and sometimes had to sit outside for hours until her parents came home from work. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said he saw her when her brothers made her `` bum cigarettes for them.'' `` They stayed shut up in the house,'' said 74-year-old <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who lives next door along the dusty dirt road around the lake. `` She'd run out and one of her brothers would ... take her in the house and slam the door.'' <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>'s daughter-in-law, told The Journal-Constitution she sometimes heard cries of `` Stop it'' from the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> trailer, but thought they were just typical family squabbles. `` She'd come out of the door and say, ` Leave me alone,''' she recalled. `` When I heard about the arrests it upset me real bad.'' The Tuckers, <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> and other neighbors were interviewed a few hours before a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge issued a gag order barring attorneys, law-enforcement personnel and potential witnesses from discussing the case. Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> approved the motion Friday at the request of Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, who said the gag order was needed to protect the alleged victim and to ensure a fair trial for the defendants. The girl's mother, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, told the judge that news reports were causing her great emotional distress and problems at work. Mrs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has told authorities she was unaware of any sexual assaults on her daughter. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the three oldest brothers attended the hearing. They are being held in the <LOCATION> Irwin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, and the juvenile is being held in the <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Eastman </LOCATION>. Officials said the charges against the stepfather and the four brothers are based on alleged assaults dating back to January 1988. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said the girl told him `` it had been happening since she was 8 years old.'' He said he believed the girl sought help out of fears she might be pregnant: `` She told my granddaughter, ` I might be pregnant, and I'm scared.''' She is in foster care pending the outcome of the case. People who report suspected child abuse are guaranteed confidentiality, but <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said he wanted his name publicized so people will `` know not to do it around me.'' `` I feel protective about all kids,'' said the 56-year-old disabled veteran, who has four adopted grandchildren. `` We had a gut feeling something was wrong, but could n't prove it,'' he said. `` The first time I knew ... I went to the authorities.'' `` We knowed something was going on, but you just do n't do anything unless you know for sure,'' said <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has accepted binding international agreements partly aimed at increased protection of civilians during internal armed conflicts, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Other East bloc states are expected to follow <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s lead in ratifying the two protocols, or additions, to the 1949 Geneva Conventions on international humanitarian law, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials said. In April, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> became the first East European country to ratify the protocols. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` extremely gratified'' by the Soviet decision. The private, all-Swiss humanitarian agency monitors compliance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> conventions and the 1977 protocols. Soviet officials notified the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> that the Supreme Soviet, the nation's legislature, approved ratification of the two protocols without reservations, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The two texts were agreed by a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> diplomatic conference in June 1977. Many countries signed, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but not all ratified the agreements. The first protocol strengthens the protection of victims of fighting between countries; the second applies to internal conflict. Eighty-six nations have ratified the first protocol and 76 are party to the second. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed both texts but ratified neither. The second protocol was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for ratification, but the first was not because <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said it could give recognition and protection to terrorist groups. The Geneva Conventions, drafted under the impression of World War II, are designed to protect wounded and sick soldiers in the field and at sea, prisoners of war and civilians in time of war. The 1977 protocols were added to cover modernized forms of warfare. For civilians in internal conflict, the conventions offer protection after they have been captured or arrested, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> jurist noted. The second protocol expanded those safeguards to cover the effects of internal fighting, such as bombings and shootings, on the population at large.

 Parents of lawbreaking minors could be placed in a public stockade under an ordinance adopted by the City Council. `` Until we introduce shame back in crime and punishment, we're spinning our wheels,'' City Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said The ordinance also requires anyone under 18 must be off the streets and away from public places and private businesses from 11 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. The ordinance was approved unanimously Saturday following a street fight the night before and an increase in crime during the summer. Parents unable to control their children may sign a statement saying so and the minors will be considered delinquent and have their fate decided by juvenile courts. Those parents will have to pay the city $ 100 for each minor so designated or render 20 hours of community service. The parents will also be required to place a placard at their homes and display a bumper sticker on their vehicle saying: `` My children are not my responsibility. They are yours.'' Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said Monday he doubted that the city would ever use a stockade because the city has none. The ordinance calls for: _ Misdemeanor charges against parents or guardians of minors `` who fail to exercise control'' over their wards after being warned that the minor is in violation of the ordinance _ Minors who violate the provisions to be taken into custody and held by the police until they are turned over to their parents or guardians _ Parents of children who violate the ordinance to be fined up to $ 500, jailed for up to 30 days, and `` placed within stockaded public display six hours a day'' but not more than two consecutive days Adults who fail to abide by the ordinance may also have their photograph placed in the local weekly newspaper for two weeks. A caption would read, `` Irresponsible Parent or Custodian,'' whichever applies. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said he was not sure about the constitutionality of the stockade but felt sure the other provisions were constitutional. Police Chief <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said the fight that pushed the City Council into action involved about six young people and adults and drew 250 onlookers. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said the ordinance could be lifted if youngsters' conduct improves `` Something's got to be done,'' the city attorney said. `` There are people in this town afraid to go out of the house. -LRB- Youths -RRB- curse them -LRB- and -RRB- steal their checks out of the mailboxes. The older ones will initiate the younger ones by making them steal. If they do n't join the gang, they whip them.''

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s social and political turmoil will make it more difficult for its communist government to deal with galloping inflation, falling industrial output and other economic woes, according to a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Economic reform has been put on hold by the central government and economic problems could prompt renewed political unrest in the 1990's, said the report to the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> released Tuesday. `` The new leadership has endorsed a continuation of the austerity program, but the social and political turmoil that has gripped <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since April will make it difficult for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to solve its pressing economic problems,'' the report said. The preoccupation of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders with consolidating power, ridding the government of supporters of deposed Premier <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and strengthening party and ideological control `` will prevent them from formulating new solutions to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic problems,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> analysts concluded. `` Pressures to increase government expenditures and expand the money supply have probably grown because of the social unrest,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> report said. `` <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> may attempt to increase income subsidies and loans to state enterprises enough to ensure that wages of most urban workers keep pace with inflation.'' Inflation in 1989 hit 19 percent overall and 30 percent in urban areas, the highest levels since the communists came to power in 1949. Inflation in large cities remained at the 30 percent rate early this year and is likely to remain in double digits for the rest of 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> authors also said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s military leaders probably will play a larger political and economic role in return for the military crackdown last May on democracy demonstrations in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` Military leaders probably will petition civilian authorities to reverse the decade-long decline in the share of the budget going to defense,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> report was made public by Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, chairman of the panel's national security subcommittee. <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> said the report shows that `` the clock is turning backward for the Chinese economy.'' `` A decade of economic reform may have effectively come to a standstill with the crackdown in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is in danger of being re-centralized,'' <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> said `` ... The unfortunate lesson for Westerners is that economic reform in socialist countries is not irreversible.'' The report said that while <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s gross national product grew by more than 11 percent in 1988 and industrial output grew by 21 percent, those rates slumped in the first half of this year with industrial growth falling to an annual rate of 11 percent. The government postponed price decontrol indefinitely and reimposed price controls on such commodities as steel, copper, aluminum and other materials. Controls over production, marketing and distribution were recentralized. International financial institutions such as the World bank and the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> have suspended billions of dollars in low-interest development loans. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s trade deficit reached $ 7.7 billion in 1988 and exports are slipping, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> reported, estimating that export revenues fell by $ 100 million a day during the occupation of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square by pro-democracy forces The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> projected a drop in foreign exchange earned through tourism from 1988's $ 2.2 billion to about $ 1.5 billion this year, and said tourism could remain depressed into the 1990s.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, sidestepping disputes with civil rights advocates, pledged Tuesday to work with them to halt the decline of inner cities and to remove barriers for minorities. He vowed, `` We will make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> open and equal to all.'' `` My administration is committed to reaching out to minorities, to striking down barriers to free and open access,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told delegates to the 79th annual conference of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will not tolerate discrimination, bigotry or bias of any kind _ period,'' he said. The president got a cordial reception, interrupted by applause 10 times from a mostly black audience of several thousand people. He did not unveil any initiatives. Nor did he address several areas where his administration has alienated civil rights groups, such accepting without complaint <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings limiting affirmative action, vetoing minimum wage legislation and nominating <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to be the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top civil rights enforcer. The <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> lawyer's nomination was rejected by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee after criticism by black leaders that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who also is black, lacked experience in discrimination cases. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the Urban League that `` in many respects, urban <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> offers a bleak picture, an inner city in crisis,'' with problems of crime, drugs, school dropouts, and limited economic opportunities. `` Your problems are my problems,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Today, I offer you my hand, I offer you my word. Together we will make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> open and equal to all. Together, we will find a way to stop the decline in our inner cities _ to restore hope, and make the'90s a decade of urban renaissance.'' Commenting afterward on the speech, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., the majority whip of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I think what we've got here is a president who's got the right tone He's given us some criteria to judge him by but we have n't seen the specifics, the means for fighting that war on drugs, the means of investing in education. Education is key but where is the money going to come from?'' Urban League President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said that in evaluating <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration, `` I am willing to concede that the first six to eight months is the rhetoric period. We will use the next 12 months to determine how well he does in carrying that out. `` His rhetoric is right,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. `` He is saying the right things. Now we have to find out whether he is going to do the right things.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the audience, `` Now, I'm not afraid to say we've got hard work ahead of us. We've got to wage war on poverty and wage war on despair, wage war on the hopelessness that robs us of our future. `` I want to tell all of you here, I'm not going to relax in this job or rest until I know that I have done everything in my power to assure that we succeed _ that every child in our inner cities has a shot at a good job, that every kid stays in school and gets a quality education, yes, lives in decent housing in a neighborhood free of drugs, fear and violence.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, accused by some civil rights leaders of failing to match his words with actions, said that `` we've all spent a lot of time over the past two decades debating the best means of ending unequal treatment ... about affirmative action, about quotas, about goals and timetables.'' However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s population growing older, there will be an abundance of job opportunities in the 1990s. `` For every child growing up today _ black or white, urban or rural _ there will be a job waiting.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that he has proposed a $ 250 million dollar increase in <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> funds and had included in a $ 441 million education package some money for grants to schools hit hardest by drugs. He called anew for approval of a program of enterprise zones giving tax breaks to inner-city businesses, and said that a six-year-old job training program has been helping disadvantaged youths enter the workforce. There was no mention in the speech of a rumored trip by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to central <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> later this year. White House aides said the possibility of such a trip is not being widely discussed in the administration. Meanwhile, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not decided whether to resubmit <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' name during the current congressional recess, which would temporarily avoid the confirmation process. Likewise, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> indicated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not about to change his view that no new laws are needed to modify the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings. `` That's a decision that's already been made by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>New Prime Minister Says No Policy Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> was installed as prime minister Tuesday and said policies will remain the same, including one barring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> ports because they might carry nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> became nuclear-free during the five-year tenure of his predecessor, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, who became involved in major disputes with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> over the issue. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, 47, resigned Monday, citing health reasons, and the governing <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chose <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> to succeed him. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, also 47, said of <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>: `` You have led with a vision and humanity that will be hard for any of us to match.'' The nuclear argument with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> began because of that country's nuclear tests in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and grew when French agents bombed a <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ship docked in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, killing a photographer who worked for the environmental organization Two agents involved in the 1985 bombing are back in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, despite an agreement with <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'s government that they would be assigned to a French atoll in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rabbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Namaliu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> said Tuesday he would miss <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'s `` fearless diplomacy.'' In a statement congratulating <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> looks forward to productive dealings with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> under his leadership.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, prime minister of neighboring <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, said he and <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> were close despite some policy differences. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> told a news conference <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s future well-being depended on <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The economy deteriorated while <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> was in office, partly because of tight regulation, and he appointed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> to reform it. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> deregulated industry, sold off state assets and wanted to go farther, but <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said the social cost of moving so fast was too high. Early last year, <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>'s plans to take his approach into social services and the labor market, sacred territories to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. They argued in public and <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> fired <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> last December. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> was re-elected to the Cabinet last week and <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> was supposed to give him a portfolio Monday, but resigned instead. In a final swipe at <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> during his farewell speech, <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said the `` juggernaut of the New Right'' had been beaten. An editorial Tuesday in the Sydney Morning Herald said: `` The timing of the resignation suggests that health was not his only consideration. By resigning now he makes it more difficult for Mr. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> to become prime minister, something that might have happned had he held on to the end of the year.'' <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> suffered a heart attack a year ago.

<HEAD>Administration Sees Contras Remaining if Unsatisfied by Peace Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Tuesday that the Nicaraguan Contra rebels can remain together as a fighting force if they do n't like the plan by Central American presidents to disband them. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration is `` generally supportive'' of the pact agreed to by the presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. But he said `` we're skeptical'' of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s commitment to democratic reforms The agreement calls for the rebels to voluntarily disband by Dec. 5 and be peacefully repatriated, so long as the Nicaraguan government moves toward democratic elections. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said the pact is far from the `` death sentence'' for the Contras described by Nicaraguan <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. `` We're clearly moving toward demobilization and repatriation ...,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` We're moving in that direction but I think it's too early to say that the game's over.'' `` Our policy is ... we would not like to see demobilization before the election,'' set for Feb. 25, he told reporters. The 120-day plan set out in accords signed by the presidents Monday set a 30-day deadline for a joint U.N.-Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> observer mission to be organized and another 90 days for the Contras to demobilize. The Contras, whose 10,000 troops are encamped in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> along the Nicaraguan border, are to be part of negotiations with the commission and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to work out details of the demobilization, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> emphasized that if the Contras do n't like the conditions developed by the commission, `` The issue then is, they're still there. If they do n't agree to it, they're not demobilized.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would not discuss what stand the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would then take on renewed funding for the rebels. The current aid package calls for $ 49.8 million in food, clothes and other non-lethal aid to last through Feb. 28 next year. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials refused to confirm reports that the administration had lobbied the Central American leaders to keep the Contras intact until the election. `` The timetables and the issue of before and after the elections ... is not something that we focus on specifically,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` What we focus on is the process and the steps needed to make the process work.'' The Center for Democracy, a private, non-partisan <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> group picked to monitor the Nicaraguan election next February, said the pact's success depend on how the provisions of a political accord last week between the Sandinistas and opposition parties are implemented. `` We are at the moment of truth with regard to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, the center's president, `` one that can lead toward genuine democratization ... or away from those goals.'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, whose organization also monitored the 1986 Philippine and the 1988 Panamanian elections for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> should also seek an immediate start to the promised amnesty for political prisoners and a plan to let the Contras vote in the election without having to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they were pleased with the parts of the Central American pact that call for an end to the nine-year-old Salvadoran civil war being waged by Marxist rebels, the voluntary nature of the demobilization, and the requirement for verifiable conditions that will allow peaceful and secure repatriation of the Contras. They also said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s recent concessions, announced on the eve of the Central American presidents' meeting, to ease restrictions on the media coverage and allow voting by soldiers were a positive sign. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., chairman of the Foreign Relations Western hemisphere affairs subcommittee, called for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cooperation with the accord `` It is our role, as friends of democracy and as neighbors with a profound interest in the stability of the region, to support this process,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said Tuesday.

 A federal grand jury is investigating former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book deal and has subpoenaed documents from at least three groups that directly or indirectly bought bulk copies of `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' for which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> earned royalties of 55 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> refused Tuesday to disclose the nature of its investigation. Attorneys for two organizations said it involved <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, and a spokesman for a third said it had also been subpoenaed for documents related to the former congressional leader. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, after a year's investigation, said it had reason to believe <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, had tried to evade <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on outside income through bulk sales of the book. That investigation ended with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s resignation in June. Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday they had received subpoenas from a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> grand jury here. A spokesman for Ocean Spray, a cranberry and citrus growers cooperative in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said documents from the group were also being sought by the grand jury. <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fly </PERSON> said the university received a subpoena, dated July 14, on Monday, and has until Friday to submit documents surrouding <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s speech to the school in the fall of 1984 and the subsequent purchase of $ 3,000 worth of the book. <PERSON> Laurene </PERSON> <PERSON> Janik </PERSON>, general counsel for the Realtors organization, said the group is also responding to a grand jury subpoena relating to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettit </PERSON>, managing partner of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of the law firm of <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> and Park, said it had been asked to `` supply some documents in connection with the grand jury investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and we're happy to comply.'' <PERSON> Pettit </PERSON>, who testified before the ethics committee, said that `` as far as I can tell, what they are asking for is pretty much what was asked for in the ethics committee investigation.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, administrative assistant at <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, said that the investigation appears `` very routine'' and that it resulted from the media attention focused on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> during the ethics investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the agency's inquiry is continuing `` I ca n't comment on any aspect of the investigation, except I will confirm that is ongoing,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> attorney Fly said the university had agreed to pay <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> $ 3,000 for a speech. After <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s appearance, someone in the speaker's office called the university to say <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had reached his limit on outside income <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff member then asked if the speaker could use the $ 3,000 to instead purchase copies of his book for the university, Fly said He said that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> endorsed the check and gave it over to his publisher. `` We received about 504 copies of that book,'' Fly said. Under an agreement with the publisher of his book, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was to receive 55 percent royalties. While the House limits what a member can keep in fees from speaking engagements to 30 percent of his or her congressional salary, royalties are exempt. Ms. <PERSON> Janik </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spoke to the Realtors group in April 1985. A $ 2,000 check was issued and voided, and the money was to be used to purchase <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, she said. But the Realtors have no record of receiving copies of the book and no staff member has any recollection of seeing the books, Ms. <PERSON> Janik </PERSON> said. Ocean Spray spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spoke to a group of growers and management employees in November 1985, but <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff suggested that, instead of giving <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> a $ 2,000 honorarium, <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spray </ORGANIZATION> use the money to purchase $ 2,000 worth of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s books for the congressman's `` As far as we were concerned, it was an honorarium in the form of a book purchase in place of a cash honorarium,'' <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> said. `` How he was to use them -LRB- the books -RRB- was for him to determine.'' <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spray </ORGANIZATION> did not want to discuss details of the subpoena, other than to confirm that `` they are limited to matters relating to the former speaker.''

 Representatives of striking <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> telephone workers and the company resumed contract talks Tuesday as telephone service continued with few interruptions. The meeting, which lasted just over two hours, ended without any apparent agreement being reached. A union representative, who declined to give her name, refused to comment about the proceedings as the meeting ended. A <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> representative would only say that the two sides were clarifying and evaluating the issues in an attempt to resolve the three-day contract dispute. Barred by court injunction from mass picketing, striking telephone workers marched in limited numbers Tuesday outside <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> buildings in six states and the nation's capital. The strike at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> was part of a nationwide walkout that involved two other regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies _ <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. In all, about 157,000 union workers in 15 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> were on strike, forcing management to work long hours in such jobs as answering directory assistance queries. The companies urged people to dial direct when possible and no major delays were reported for those calling without operator assistance. The <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> strike has idled 52,000 workers, including 41,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Another 11,000 workers are members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. No talks have been scheduled with the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION>, and no talks were scheduled in the other two strikes. `` We're pleased the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> accepted our offer to come back to the table,'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouser </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> vice president for corporate relations, said in a prepared statement. `` It demonstrates the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION>'s good faith in reaching an equitable, timely agreement.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said before the meeting that the company had requested the session to informally discuss items that were already on the table. Five <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> pickets were arrested Monday in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> for allegedly violating the mass picketing ban, but were discharged after a brief hearing before Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Toth </PERSON>, president and business agent for Local 1944, said there was confusion at the time of their arrest because their union was n't named in the injunction. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaine </PERSON>, a Bell of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> spokesman, said the union later agreed to abide by the order and not force the company to go to court again. Meantime, the flow of telephone service _ most of it automated and handled by computers _ continued at a near normal level. `` Management employees are doing their best to maintain service levels as close to normal as they can,'' said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON>. `` There is some slowness in getting directory assistance and in operator assistance for toll calls in our area of service. `` But everything else which is automated is working fine. The strike is having no effect on basic services, like telephone calls from homes to homes and business to business.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaer </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday, `` Things are going pretty much as expected. Directory assistance is a little slow, and we're not doing installations as we would regularly. We're not at 100 percent but that was not to be expected.''

 Police and farmers with flashlights searched a remote mountain area Tuesday night for the missing plane carrying Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and 13 other people. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>, political officer at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, said the search was conducted on foot and with the aid of jeeps, trucks and other vehicles. The aerial search was suspended at dusk Tuesday. Embassy officials said several planes remained on dirt airstrips in the desolate area of southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, ready to resume the search at dawn. The twin-engine plane carrying <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and the other disappeared Monday on its way to the Fugnido refugee camp near the border with <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, 480 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. The 44-year-old <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunger </ORGANIZATION> and he has taken a keen interest in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s refugee problem Aboard the plane with him were eight other Americans and five Ethiopians. His office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the Americans included <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s chief of staff; <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the Hunger committee staff, and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> from the staff of Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he telephoned <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Alison </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to express his concern and promise his administration will do `` all we can to learn'' what has happened `` She's strong, has a lot of hope, and we all pray that he's safe,'' But told a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where delegates observed a moment of silent prayer for <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s survival `` I think it says a lot about <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> that he was on his sixth humanitarian mission to help feed the hungry in that part of the world,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the meeting. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s government has asked for a `` specialized search plane'' and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to find one to accommodate them `` We have offered to assist in every way we can,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. Heavy clouds and poor visibility hampered aerial sweeps Tuesday as rescue planes criss-crossed the cold, windswept plateau in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> until sunset. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charge d'affaires in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, said searchers were encouraged by reports that a small plane was sighted Monday circling a field at <LOCATION> Dembidola </LOCATION>, 75 miles from the refugee camp. `` If it was our plane, what we find encouraging is that it would have transversed a lot of the more treacherous terrain to Fugnido,'' said <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Dembidola </PERSON> is in an inaccessible region far from communications points, `` which could provide a benign explanation for why we have n't heard anything.'' `` They could be sitting in the bush with the plane not capable of taking off but in good shape waiting for search and rescue,'' <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON> said. At a briefing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> also was hopeful. `` At this point no news is good news,'' she said, recalling being on similar trips with the congressman where air travel and communications were disrupted. `` The safest thing for them to do was land and just sit tight and we think that is what the congressman did,'' she said. She was confident the sighted plane was <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s, she said, because Ethiopian air controllers keep close tabs on planes and no others were supposed to be in the area. Also in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> authorities in the past have used bad weather as an excuse to prevent American congressmen from visiting refugee camps or other controversial sites. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said in June that he and <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> were to visit northern refugee camps in March but were told their charter from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> airport could not take off because of bad weather. The lawmaker said the weather appeared fine. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s Twin Otter aircraft left <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> in heavy clouds and poor visibility at about 10:30 a.m. Monday after a two-hour delay caused by bad weather, said embassy political officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>. The plane was last heard from about 15 minutes after it took off. `` It was about 25 miles outside of Addis at the time,'' <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> said. The Twin Otter, a plane commonly used for <PERSON> bush </PERSON> flying in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, carried eight people who were members of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s staff, embassy personnel or officers of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. The five Ethiopians aboard were three government officials, the pilot and co-pilot. <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> said the pilot was highly experienced and had flown all over the treacherously mountainous country for international relief agencies. Half a dozen small planes were being used in the hunt directed by <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. A C-130 Hercules cargo plane also was standing by.

<HEAD>Proposal: No Politics, Speeches, Picnics, Bikes at Viet Monument</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group that built a memorial to honor the city's <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War dead wants to ban political activity, pets, bicycles and radios at the site to preserve a dignified atmosphere. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund also wants to ban sports and picnics. `` It's not just here in <LOCATION> Philly </LOCATION>, but across the nation, these memorials have taken on the sanctity of a burial ground,'' said District Attorney <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON>, the group's vice president. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> called the proposal `` blatantly unconstitutional.'' `` The streets and parks belong to the people and are free and open to them to communicate messages,'' said <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Fairmount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approves this, there is no doubt in my mind it will be challenged out of this office.'' The granite monument is inscribed with the names of 641 people killed in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The memorial group said the proposed regulations are not a response to any specific activities, but are intended to dignify the memorial. The veterans fund wants to allow only memorial services or ceremonies honoring Philadelphians who died or were listed as missing in action. City officials and the memorial fund officers are negotiating for a `` deed of gift,'' a document transferring control of the monument from the non-profit memorial fund to the city. It would then come under the park commission's jurisdiction. Under the proposal, `` Partisan'' activities would be banned, including demonstrations for or against federal, state or local governments or their policies. Also banned would be any activity by a political party or a group seeking publicity, speechmaking of a partisan nature and picketing, sign-waving or leaflet distribution. The memorial fund further wants to ban non-political activities like soliciting, sports, picnics, walking pets, bicycling, roller skating, littering, spitting, and playing radios or other audio and video equipment. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mifflin </PERSON>, executive director of the park commission, said the proposed regulations were unprecedented for his organization. `` To my knowledge, we've never had a regulation of this sort,'' he said. The commission will consider the fund's proposal in October, <PERSON> Mifflin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziff </PERSON>, counsel to the memorial fund, said the proposal was patterned after rules adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>. The memorial was dedicated in October 1987 after the memorial fund raised $ 1.2 million to build it. On Memorial Day, vandals splashed white paint on four parts of the wall listing the names of the dead. Veterans believed the desecration was the work of youths they had chased away about 3 a.m. Firefighters flushed water over the paint, washing most of it away, and crews of veterans spent hours before and after a Memorial Day ceremony scraping and cleaning away what was left.

<HEAD>Lawyer Tells Court that Quebec Woman Proceeded with Abortion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> woman barred from an abortion by an injunction obtained by her former boyfriend went ahead with the procedure, her lawyer told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. The court's nine justices had convened in emergency session in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> to hear the case of <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> secretary, who was believed to have just entered her 23rd week of pregnancy. Her lawyer, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedard </PERSON>, did not say when or where Ms. <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON>, 21, had the abortion. He apologized to the court but asked for permission to proceed with the case because Ms. <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON> faces contempt of court. With the urgency removed from the need to proceed before an abortion would become increasing dangerous, any decision on the injunction could now be days or weeks away. Ms. <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON>'s case had focused attention nationwide on abortion and the lack of a national abortion law. It was the latest in a series of cases in provincial courts this summer. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has been without an abortion law since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in January 1988 ruled that the existing law's stringent requirements for approval infringed on a woman's rights. The House of Commons failed to approve any of six proposals in July 1988. The outcome was that abortion was a matter between a woman and her doctor until the provincial court cases emerged. The <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> last month upheld an injunction obtained by former nightclub bouncer <PERSON> Jean-Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremblay </PERSON>, 25, Ms. <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON>'s ex-boyfriend. She faced a two-year prison sentence and a $ 42,500 fine if she proceeded with the abortion. But there has not been a warrant for her arrest, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tymchyk </PERSON>, prosecutor in <LOCATION> Val </LOCATION> <LOCATION> d'Or </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, where the injunction was granted. `` We're not the ones who would bring it,'' he said. `` It's a civil injunction so it would have to be a private individual who brings contempt charges against her.'' Both <PERSON> Tremblay </PERSON> and his lawyer, <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelada </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> they did not want to take action for contempt against Ms. <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, national co-ordinator for the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said it was Ms. <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON>'s personal decision. `` It shows that women who want and need an abortion will get one _ no matter what the courts say,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> has said <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> will consider the abortion issue this fall on return from recess. The federal government has argued in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that abortion is `` within the exclusive legislative authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>'' and should not be a matter for provincial courts to decide. Quebec's Court of Appeal was divided 3-2 in upholding the injunction, basing the decision on the provincial Charter of Human Rights. Justice <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernier </PERSON> wrote in the majority position that `` the child that has been conceived but not born is a reality that must be taken into account.''

 Occasional sniper fire echoed across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday and reports said Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and his <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> foes were preparing for major battle. People streamed from the bomb-ravaged capital during a lull in combat to avoid what Moslem bank employee <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON> called `` the worst, which is yet to come.'' `` There is talk all over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that they are preparing for either a long confrontation or a final battle. We do n't want to be here in either case,'' said <PERSON> Masri </PERSON>, who was interviewed in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He said he was taking his wife and three children to settle in a rented apartment in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A police spokesman said no casualties were reported in Tuesday's firing along confrontation lines in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the nearby mountains Five months of artillery duels between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 predominantly Christian troops and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 soldiers deployed in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and other mainly Moslem sectors of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have killed 549 people and wounded 1,322. All but 200,000 of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million residents have fled to safer areas in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> or northeastern mountain resorts. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has `` decided to fight a war of attrition in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to achieve its aim of taming the Christian camp.'' The independent daily said Syrian officials informed their leftist and Lebanese Moslem allies that President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> government `` will not accept any dialogue with Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> under any circumstances. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 54, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> forces from territories they have controlled since 1976. <PERSON> An-Nahar </PERSON> said Syrian troops may try to `` storm through'' the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to topple <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. Sources from Druse chief <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main ally against <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, said the Christians could try to break into Syrian-controlled territory. One ranking source said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has `` massed tanks and troops for an operation across the traditional front line.'' The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. More than a week ago, a three-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee said its two-month mediation effort here resulted in an impasse and blamed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for blocking the initiative. Political deadlock followed. The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> said they would report back to see if they should try to reactivate the mission. An Arab summit last May 26 asked <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> to work out a <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> peace settlement by November. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> told reporters after a meeting with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has urged the Arab leaders to pursue their efforts. Outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> in September appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to lead an interim <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> that would rule pending election of a new head of state. Moslems and leftists rejected this appointment and pledged allegiance to acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> vying for legitimacy with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s. The latest round of fighting broke out in March after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, trying to salvage about $ 100 million lost annually in customs fees. Syrian and allied forces retaliated by shelling the Christian enclave, home to about 1 million people.

 <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> rejoined <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet of active space shuttles Tuesday, blasting into orbit with five astronauts to put a 10-ton spy satellite on a path over the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the oldest shuttle, had been grounded for 3 -LCB- years while it was stripped and overhauled from its toilet system to its outer skin. Its performance during the countdown and at liftoff was as troublefree as any of the previous 29 shuttle flights. `` As good as new,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON>, the launch director. `` It's going to be a gem of a vehicle. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, which booked the entire five-day flight from the civilian space agency, said nothing about the cargo in the shuttle's 60-foot-long hold. Neither did <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, which shut down its public announcement network, except for periodic `` all's well'' reports. By custom, shuttle crews launch satellites as early in the flight as possible to have the mission accomplished should they need to return home early. If that practice was followed on this mission, the satellite would have been released about seven hours after liftoff, or about 4 p.m. EDT. There was no word, however, from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The mission is expected to end Sunday with a landing at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> about 10:30 a.m. EDT. The shuttle's path, almost perpendicular from its seaside launch pad, was a confirmation of pre-launch reports that it would travel on a north-northeast course instead of heading eastward. The resulting high-latitude orbit takes it over <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and parts of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> not normally covered by eastward-bound shuttles. The satellite is designed to take highly detailed photographs of troop movements, military installations and other targets of interest. Sources close to the program said the satellite can make small adjustments to its orbit, a flexibility that would enable it to respond to changing conditions on the ground. The cargo bay reportedly holds a package of scientific instruments for military research, possibly for the `` Star Wars'' missile defense project. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, a veteran of seven flights, ended its last mission in January 1986, 10 days before the Challenger exploded with a loss of seven lives. `` Any time a vehicle is down for a long period of time it's a little worrisome,'' said <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, deputy administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` There were really no problems of any significance. The weather was good to us.'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s return restored the shuttle fleet to three ships. Atlantis is scheduled next for launch on Oct. 12, carrying the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>, and Discovery is scheduled for another military mission in November. A replacement for Challenger, the Endeavour, is to join the fleet in 1992. Mission control said <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s trajectory was `` right down the middle of the pike,'' _ a perfect path. The two booster rockets floated down on parachutes into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, within sight of recovery ships. Launch was 8:37 a.m., delayed about 40 minutes by ground fog. Not a word was heard publicly from the five astronauts, who are commanded by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, a veteran of two earlier shuttle flights, including a 1983 trip on <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The other crew members are <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` We had a completely clean and smooth ascent. There are no problems whatsoever to report,'' said launch commentator <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>. And then a news blackout began. Silence will be broken only if there is a major problem, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. Crew conversation will not be broadcast. The mission is the fifth shuttle flight since launches resumed last September after a 2 -LCB- - year hiatus prompted by the Challenger disaster After the accident, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> concentrated on modifying the newer orbiters, Discovery and Atlantis, pirating parts from <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Discovery and Atlantis each have made two trips into space since post-Challenger flights resumed. During the flight, the astronauts were to check out the safety modifications made to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, among the 258 changes that were made. `` I think the recovery process is over,'' said <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, director of the Kennedy Space Center. `` We've modified all three birds, we've flown all three birds now, and that's something we can be proud of.

<TEXT>
 A Jordanian soldier crossed the border Tuesday, shot and wounded an American and held an off-duty <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> soldier hostage for nearly four hours before a sharpshooter killed him, officials said. His victims said the man told them he was avenging a brother or sister killed by Jews. Military officials said he was deranged and acted on his own. The siege ended when Israeli troops stormed a tool shed where the attacker held the hostage in a date grove near the <PERSON> Kibbutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotan </PERSON>, a collective farm 12 miles north of the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION> and a few miles from the rugged mountains of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` A sniper very cleanly picked him off,'' said <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Maayan </PERSON>, the kibbutz secretary, who immigrated from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, armed forces chief of staff, told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>: `` I'm convinced that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> still continues to be responsible so that terrorism would not infiltrate from its borders into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, in spite of such insane soldiers. `` In spite of this being a quiet border, both the army and the civilians are trained to respond quickly to an infiltration. ... <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is doing its best to prevent infiltrations, but sometimes it's not successful.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the attack, but it did not say where the claim was issued. The Syrian-backed group is an offshoot of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The wounded woman, <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said on army radio she was walking with the soldier and another woman when `` this man in military uniform came out quickly from -LRB- behind -RRB- a tree, about three trees ahead of us, with a gun, speaking in English, something about a brother. He fired one shot and I went to the ground.'' Officials at <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yosef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said she was slightly wounded by a bullet that passed through her neck. The attack occurred on her 25th birthday, she said, and `` I was very, very lucky. I feel just fine.'' She said it would not frighten her away from the kibbutz, an assortment of brown stucco buildings that was founded by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jews </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 and has about 80 residents, a third of them <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immmigrants. It grows vegetables and dates. A Jordanian statement identified the attacker as <PERSON> Farid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> and said he abandoned a border observation post. Armed with a U.S.-made M-16, the man attacked at 11:30 a.m. just outside the fenced kibbutz. The army said hostage soldier <PERSON> Osnat </PERSON> <PERSON> Lev </PERSON>, who is in an army unit that lives and works on collective farms, was rescued after 3 p.m. by a special anti-terrorist unit. Ms. <PERSON> Maayan </PERSON> said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier fired one shot as other troops shouted and the attacker came into view through a door of the corrugated steel shed. Ms. <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> said on the radio her attacker kept mentioning a dead sister and asked the location of Israeli army bases he could attack. `` He said all the time that his sister was killed, and why was she killed, and why I killed her. So I said I did not kill her at all. He said that the Jews killed her and now he comes to kill everybody,'' the soldier said. The sharpshooter fired into the shed about 500 yards from the kibbutz fence after soldiers attempted to negotiate with the attacker for hours, radio reports said. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tushinsky </PERSON>, a member of the kibbutz council, said the gunman asked for a Koran, the Moslem holy book, and set a deadline. `` A copy of Koran was brought and several minutes after that the story was over,'' he said. Other kibbutz residents said the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was shot when he bent down to pick up the <LOCATION> Koran </LOCATION>, borrowed from some <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said there were unconfirmed reports the man asked for the release of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, the Lebanese Shiite clergyman whose kidnapping by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on July 27 has triggered a crisis over foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Deputy Army Spokesman Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said there was no connection. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the incident illustrates that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> faces a more immediate threat from terror than many other countries. `` For us fighting terrorism is a matter of ... life and death,'' he said. Two other border incidents this year involved <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. In May, a Jordanian soldier opened fire on an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> patrol, wounding two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers before he was killed. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> later said he acted on his own. In March, two gunmen crossed the border and killed an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier. A Palestinian guerrilla group claimed the attack, and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> later announced that it had arrested several men in connection with the incident.

He apparently was stabbed to death by fellow Arabs who suspected him of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. Four Palestinians were wounded in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the occupied territories, according to hospital officials. They said the victims included an 11-year-old in critical condition at a <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> hospital with a bullet wound in the chest. Meanwhile, an underground Palestinian group said in a leaflet distributed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> that funds intended to support the 20-month uprising in the occupied territories were being `` plundered.'' The leaflet named nine Palestinians who it claimed had misused up to $ 5 million in uprising funds and urged the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s main <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction to penalize them. The leaflet, and other pamphlets circulated recently, reflects growing factional rivalry in the Arab community as the uprising continues. The uprising's underground leadership called for a strike Wednesday to mark the 20 months of revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The territories were captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The victim of Tuesday's clash with the army was identified as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Burkin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>'s death raised to 530 the number of Palestinians killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and settlers since the uprising began. Thirty-eight Israelis also have died in the violence. Ninety-one Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most after they were accused of collaborating. The latest victim was identified as <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Brak </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>. The shooting of the Jewish settler and his sons occurred when the settler stopped his car near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Bidya </LOCATION> and fired several shots into a grove patrolled by an army unit. According to military sources, he mistook the troops for Palestinians about to attack his car. The unit responded with fire, wounding the settler who the army identified as <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamtzani </PERSON>. The army said <PERSON> Hamtzani </PERSON> was in fair condition, his 3-year-old son was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the head, and an older son suffered light injuries.

<HEAD>Crews Gain Ground As Strategists Brace For More Lightning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Lightning started more fires Tuesday in the forests of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, where nearly a quarter of a million acres have burned in two weeks, but the humidity was rising and scattered showers aided weary firefighters. `` We had 24,000 lightning strikes in one 24-hour period throughout the West,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Showalter </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` But we did n't pick up a lot of fires because there's some marine influence on the weather and there's been scattered showers with it. The temperatures have gone down and the humidity is up.'' The Fire Center, national coordination center for fire suppression, reported containment of fires that had been burning over 22,000 acres in the West, mainly in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and major gains were made against a number of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> blazes. More than 220,000 acres have been charred in a bout of mostly lightning-caused fires that began July 26. Manpower throughout the West still stood at 23,000. But acreage still aflame was cut back to 160,000 acres Tuesday. Even without much rain, the latest weather system sweeping in from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> did bring higher humidity to the region. In hardest-hit <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, several dozen residents of the town of <PERSON> Lowman </PERSON> 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> were allowed back in their homes Tuesday as firefighters had secured line around 60 percent of the 43,000-acre <PERSON> Lowman </PERSON> Fire that destroyed over $ 10 million in structures 10 days ago. `` They're letting them back in on the condition they be prepared to leave immediately again,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said. `` A big wind could change the picture real fast.'' Fire managers on a half dozen other blazes also had secure line along at least a third of their perimeters. `` Each day they get more strength in the lines,'' spokesman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gay </PERSON> said. `` In general, things are looking good considering.'' Showers were reported on the Oregon-Idaho border over the 10,000-acre <ORGANIZATION> Emmett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> fires </ORGANIZATION> in the Hell's Canyon area, and on Monday night light rain pelted <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, which had been partially evacuated a week ago. `` The north side of that fire that was threatening <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> is secure. The line's held now for five days,'' <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Botts </PERSON> said. Lightning started new fires Tuesday in southwestern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> but firefighters in eastern sections of the state wrapped up work on two more lightning-caused fires. Crews were close to containing the largest of the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> fires, the Canal Fire on the eastern boundary of the Eagle Cap Wilderness near Enterprise. It had blackened 23,350 acres, most of it in the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. The Monument Rock Fire, which had burned 12,000 acres of timber in the Malheur and <PERSON> Wallowa-Whitman </PERSON> national forests in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s northeastern corner, was contained Monday night, said <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayno </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> It destroyed three structures at a remote mine and forced evacuation of campgrounds and a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> lookout. The possibility of more lightning and wind led to posting of `` red flag'' warnings in eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, although the thunderstorms did bring some rain. The state's biggest fire was 2,500 acres on the <ORGANIZATION> Colville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION> in the northeastern corner. Crews contained two forest fires that had burned for more than a week in central and southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Both the 15,300-acre <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION> fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and the 7,500-acre <PERSON> Balch </PERSON> fire in <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> were declared 100 percent contained Monday evening. Crews in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> had contained the 1,700-acre <LOCATION> Chalk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> blaze about 45 miles east of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and expected to declared it controlled by Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 Two congressmen who are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> received official permission Tuesday to enter a Soviet prison camp notorious for its treatment of dissidents, <LOCATION> Perm </LOCATION> Camp 35 in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. Reps. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., said they got approval to make the trip Wednesday after meeting with Soviet Interior Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> and the country's chief prosecutor, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukharev </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and I are the first two congressman to go to the <LOCATION> Perm </LOCATION> camp,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` This, like the other <LOCATION> Perm </LOCATION> camps, <ORGANIZATION> Perm </ORGANIZATION> 36 and <ORGANIZATION> Perm </ORGANIZATION> 36-1, are notorious for their mistreatment, particularly of political prisoners,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Perm </ORGANIZATION> 35 has housed such prominent prisoners as <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> contends all political prisoners have been released during his tenure, although human rights groups believe dissidents remain in harsh labor camps. Former prisoners have said confinement at <LOCATION> Perm </LOCATION> Camp 35, about 1,000 miles from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and 80 miles outside the industrial town of <LOCATION> Perm </LOCATION>, includes every-other-day rations of bread and gruel, bone-chilling cold, isolation cells and new punishments tacked onto their sentences. `` We're trying to make sure there are no prisoners of conscience, make sure they're treated fairly and adequately,'' said <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. Both congressmen think the visit could pressure the Soviets to eliminate abuses before the <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> convenes in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1991. `` We're here to promote the general human rights issue,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who has arranged to meet with Jewish dissidents, members of the Russian Orthodox church and evangelical Christians since arriving in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Friday. `` According to people who are in <LOCATION> Perm </LOCATION>, just our visit helps to improve things in the short term,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` If the Soviets are going to host a conference on human rights and have a very restrictive and oppressive series of camps of forced labor, we're going to raise the issue until we get meaningful reforms. The first foreigner to observe <ORGANIZATION> Perm </ORGANIZATION> 35 conditions, <PERSON> A.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, a columnist and former executive editor of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said that despite claims that dissidents have been released, the camp held `` people who were put in jail for expressing their opinion or for trying to leave the country, or for doing something that in a normal society would not be considered a crime.'' Although Soviet authorities promised the journalist prisoners he talked to would not be punished, <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said, `` I have reason to believe they have retaliated against one quite severely.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> warned any retribution against <ORGANIZATION> Perm </ORGANIZATION> prisoners he interviews would place the Soviets' human rights record `` in a very bad light.'' The two originally planned to tour <ORGANIZATION> Perm </ORGANIZATION> 35 with former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Colson </PERSON>, a former aide to President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> who was convicted in the Watergate scandal, but the Soviets restricted the visit to the lawmakers and a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> translator.

<HEAD>Hurricane Dean Downgraded; Causes Little Damage in Newfoundland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hurricane Dean moved across largely unpopulated areas of <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> Tuesday, causing little damage, and was downgraded to a tropical storm. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> of the Canadian Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> said there was concern when it appeared <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> might affect St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s or other populated areas but it `` tracked right across good moose pasture.'' The cold water of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> knocked much of the strength out of the storm and it lost even more crossing land. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> would become just another low pressure system overnight. Winds of up to 50 mph whipped up 30 foot waves along <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>'s south coast and fairly heavy rain fell in some areas, but <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> said people in the area `` witness this type of wind several times each winter. If you've ever been to <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, the trees along the coast are nothing to write home about.'' <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a cook at a restaurant in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, central <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, said some people were worried when they heard <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was on the way, but when it arrived the storm `` did n't last very long. It was n't much for damage.'' <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> said the storm followed a path about 80 miles wide across <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> and passed 60 miles north of St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s. It came ashore at <LOCATION> Harbour </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Breton </LOCATION> on the south coast and returned to open water at <LOCATION> Bonavista </LOCATION> on the northeast coast about four hours later.

 An agreement to disband U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels was praised Tuesday throughout most of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and both sides in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s civil war said the accords might help bring peace there. But leaders of the rebels, known as Contras, said their fighters would n't disarm until democracy is guaranteed in their homeland. `` We're ready to comply with the <PERSON> Tela </PERSON> accords, but it's too early to talk about giving up our weapons,'' said rebel military chief <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement reached Monday by five Central American presidents in a summit at <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, was a triumph for Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. He said the accord brought <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> `` to the gates of peace'' but the nation could not `` let down its guard until the Contras are disbanded.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is `` generally supportive'' of the accord but is skeptical of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s commitment to democratic reforms. He said it was up to the Contras to decide to remain a fighting force if they do n't like the plan to disband them. The pact signed by the presidents of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> calls for disarming and disbanding 11,000 Contra guerrillas and 12,000 dependents based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> within 120 days _ or Dec. 5. In return, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> promised to guarantee democracy, allow the Contras to return home, and drop a suit in the world court against <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> over the Contra bases. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, government officials and guerrillas praised the accords Tuesday and said they could contribute to the quest to end the 10-year-old war there. The rebels' <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said over its clandesdtine radio station it `` vigorously applauds'' the agreement. It called the accord `` a victory for revolutionary, progressive, independent and democratic forces of the region.'' Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said he was pleased with the result of the summit and underscored what he said was <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s commitment to halt Nicarguan support for the Salvadoran rebels.. Sources close to the talks in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had pressed for a delay until after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government holds elections scheduled But Contra sources said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had already been trying to force rebel leaders to give up the fight and join the political process. Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> bitterly called the accord a product of `` political confusion'' in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Contras began fighting in 1981, accusing the Sandinistas of betraying the ideals of the revolution that overthrew President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in July 1979. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> non-lethal aid continues to the rebels, but military aid was suspended in February 1988. The scale of the fighting since then has declined so much that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government announced last week it was suspending the draft. The agreement calls for a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Nations-organized observer commission. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he was studying the `` long and complex'' agreement. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said he would meet with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commission but no repatriation could take place `` until the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> show they are headed toward democracy.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has set an election for Feb. 25. Last week he got his domestic political opponents to join in a call for disbandment of the Contras. Members of the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> opposition on Tuesday attributed the accord to the thaw between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, saying reduced Soviet support was forcing the Sandinistas to compromise. `` Neither side is interested in using Third World conflicts to get at the other any more,'' conservative politician <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the Nicaraguan capital. A source close to President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, who won the Nobel Prize for starting the peace process two years ago, said the five presidents went ahead with the agreement because they were convinced that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was serious about democratization. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> noted, however, that previous Central American accords fell apart and urged his fellow presidents to summon the `` political will'' needed for compliance. Honduran political will is a key factor because only the Hondurans can cut off the Contras' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supply lifeline to border camps. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has wanted to be rid of the Contra problem ever since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid was withdrawn but also insists <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> can enjoy peaceful borders only when <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> becomes a democracy. Like most Central Americans, the Hondurans are weary of the fighting that has occupied their minds and sapped their economies for a decade. Most commentators in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> hailed President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>, although the conservative newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> called the agreement one-sided: `` It's clear what the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> got. It's not absolutely clear what they gave up.'' <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said Contra fighters would face three choices if the accord goes through: Exile, return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> peacefully, or keep fighting inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Speaking on condition of anonymity, as did other sources, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> officials said they feared some fighters would not give up no matter what and would return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in small bands that would be massacred by the Sandinista army. `` In any case, we have to consult the fighting men and see what they want to do,'' <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said. A Contra official said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funding for the group's <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office was cut from $ 262,000 a month to $ 24,000, with more than 100 people laid off. He accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials of trying to force Contra leaders back into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` We do n't have more than five people left,'' said <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguello </PERSON>, a Contra adviser in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Staffing at offices in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> also has been severely cut, Contra officials said.

 Firefighters Tuesday doused a rubbish fire that had buckled a section of a major highway, while a judge ordered the dump where the waste was found to remove garbage piled beneath two busy roadways. A two-judge appeals panel ordered <ORGANIZATION> Hub </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recycling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scrap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to refuse any more construction waste until a lower court can decide whether the facility poses a threat to the community. The judges also told <ORGANIZATION> Hub </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recycling </ORGANIZATION> to clean out materials that lie beneath the highways _ Interstate 78 and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Route 22 _ and not place new waste under the roads. Flames and heat from a pile of debris Monday buckled an elevated portion of Interstate 78, a critical east-west link with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in one of the nation's busiest highway interchanges. State officials say repairs could take a year. Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> lauded the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, saying it would pave the way for a cleanup at the site, which state officials say is an illegal landfill. `` With our hands no longer tied, we can begin to clean up this mess and make sure the disaster does n't get worse,'' he said. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> declared an emergency, allowing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to ask for federal help in paying for the repairs to the highway. Fire officials, using bulldozers to reach buried pockets of flame, said they had extinguished the blaze, which on Monday threatened to spread toward Route 22, now the main alternate to motorists using Interstate 78. `` Basically, the fire is out, but there's always the possibility of something being buried that was n't knocked out,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON>, a fire department spokesman. Fire officials are investigating arson, and the state attorney general's office has opened a criminal investigation. State officials allege <PERSON> Hub </PERSON> was dumping materials illegally, and said they have been trying for months to halt the piling up of waste at the four-acre site. `` The events of the last 36 hours demonstrate that the existence of this facility poses an imminent threat to the area,'' said Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>. He added that piles of garbage at the site hindered firefighters' and emergency workers' access to the dump

 The fifth congress of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the main group in the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, closed Tuesday with a call for increased military action to end <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. More than 1,000 members of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> rejected <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan for elections in the occupied territories. Fatah is led by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. The delegates approved a resolution calling for `` intensification of the armed struggle and all other forms of battle to put an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.'' Hard-liners had pressed the congress to recommend extending the armed struggle beyond the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recent declaration that military action would be confined to the occupied territories helped the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> open a dialogue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s chief supporter. The Fatah resolution, distributed by the Palestinian news agency <ORGANIZATION> WAFA </ORGANIZATION>, did not say what kind of military operations might be conducted outside the occupied lands or define `` all other forms of battle.'' Under <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegates would be chosen to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Fatah said elections must be held in `` a democratic atmosphere under international supervision after the withdrawal of Israeli forces ... as part of a global plan for a definitive solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict.'' The congress repeated its call for an international conference on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace, continuing dialogue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and talks with `` democratic Israeli forces'' who oppose the occupation and `` support the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A longtime abortion rights activist said Tuesday he has closed his abortion referral clinic because he ca n't afford to keep it open, and claimed he has been pushed aside by some feminist groups and Planned Parenthood. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, 57, who has lobbied for abortion rights for almost 27 years, said he is bitter about the circumstances surrounding his departure from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where he established his clinic in 1967. He retains abortion referral clinics in <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hauppage </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state's <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Like Planned Parenthood, the clinics perform pregnancy tests and refer patients to doctors who perform abortions. `` I emptied everything out Saturday,'' said <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>. `` We wept and hugged each other and I put a sign out front saying ` We Shall Return.' I think there's something immoral about the original pioneer being forced out because he ca n't come up with the rent.'' <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said his main source of revenue, college campus lectures, has been effectively cut off by anti-abortion activists. `` I've been very badly hurt by a successful campaign by anti-abortion forces who threatened to picket or bomb colleges or universities where I appeared,'' he said. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> also said women's rights groups have resented his work on their behalf. He recounted his appearance onstage at a women's rights rally when he was asked to leave because he was a man. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> also accused Planned Parenthood and its president, <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON>, of attempting to freeze him out of the abortion rights movement. <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON> did not return calls by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office Tuesday. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said he was recently heartened when he was asked to be the keynote speaker at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 2. He hopes to tour college campuses again this winter and revive his crusade. He said he and his staff plan to work for a national right to privacy amendment and want to pressure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals into escorting women to abortion clinics to prevent harassment by anti-abortion activists. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> began his crusade in the early 1960s, inspired, he said, by a woman who died in his arms after a self-inflicted abortion attempt with an coat hanger. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> served three months in prison for distributing contraceptives. His Hempstead clinic was firebombed in 1979. In 1971, he was arrested on a charge of corrupting a minor for giving a lecture on birth control before an audience that included a woman who had brought along her 14-month-old child.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Tuesday that publication of a living woman's obituary did not necessarily harm her reputation and thus does not constitute libel. The high court affirmed two lower court rulings against a family that sued the <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packet </ORGANIZATION>, which in 1985 published the obituary of a woman who had not died. The publication is not defamatory because the reported death of an individual does not impugn someone's reputation, the court said in an unanimous opinion. `` Death is a natural state and demeans no one,'' the court said. One year after publication of the false obituary of <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, the woman, her son and her mother sued for defamation and emotional distress. The onetime <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> resident said the emotional effects contributed to the loss of her job and aided her ex-husband's legal battle to gain custody of the couple's child. Ms. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> and her mother also claimed embarrassment and anxiety due to the publication of the obituary in the bi-weekly paper. The court said the woman would not have legal redress unless the newspaper falsely reported demeaning circumstances surrounding the death. Moreover, the court noted, the Packet acted properly by promptly publishing a retraction. `` The publication of the death notice did not impute to the plaintiff any wrong and did not hold her up to ridicule,'' the court said. The seventh member of the court, Chief Justice <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilentz </PERSON>, did not participate in the case.

 More than 3,000 people are preparing to leave a small area of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> republic where increased radiation has doubled the amount of illness since the 1986 nuclear disaster at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` One local manager reported that the gamma level at his home was 10 times higher than permissible levels, despite decontamination and special sanitary measures, hence a sick rate which has doubled in the region over the past three years,'' the official news agency said. It did not specify the illnesses. The dispatch came from <LOCATION> Bryansk </LOCATION>, about 210 miles from <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, the regional center for an area including the 12 villages to be evacuated. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said scientists assured the villagers in 1986 they could stay if the area was properly decontaminated, but `` experience proved them wrong, and now, more than three years after the disaster, people are preparing to move.'' Villagers are awaiting final approval from government officials, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In the past three years, residents of the 12 villages have been careful to step on asphalt rather than grass because the concentration of radiation is higher in grass, and have had food brought in, the agency reported. They no longer keep cattle for fear of contamination in the meat and milk, it said. The report follows a dispute between the government and scientists in neighboring <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> about further evacuations from the area around the nuclear power plant. Government officials in <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, say 11,000 more people should be moved, but scientists say 106,000 should be evacuated based on radiation levels in the area. About 130,000 were evacuated from around the plant in the northern <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> after an explosion and fire in its No. 4 reactor on April 26, 1986, killed 31 people and released a cloud of radioactive material that circled the globe. The 12 villages lie within a small part of the Russian republic that borders <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>. Most of those evacuated so far have been from the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>.

 A suspect in eight bank robberies around the country has told investigators he plotted to kill President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and attended several of his appearances, including one in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, authorities said Tuesday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Daughetee </PERSON>, 34, was arrested Friday in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, during a bank robbery.

<TEXT>
 Both sides in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s 10-year-old civil war on Tuesday praised the peace accords signed by five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents and said they could contribute to the search for peace here The high command of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, said it `` vigorously applauds'' the accords. The presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Monday signed an agreement for demobilizing within 120 days the Nicaraguan rebels based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The presidents also exhorted the Salvadoran government and <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate a solution to the war, which has killed an estimated 70,000 people. In a communique over their clandestine radio station, the Salvadoran rebels called the accords `` a victory for revolutionary, progressive, independent and democratic forces of the region.'' President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who took office June 1, said he was pleased with the results of the three-day session in the Honduran port of <PERSON> Tela </PERSON>. `` For the first time the Salvadoran problem has been given this level of consideration by the presidents, who commit themselves to contribute to peace in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' he said. He underscored what he said was a commitment by Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to halt his leftist government's support for the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. However, unlike sections of the accords dealing with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, no procedure was specified for verifying or enforcing the Salvadoran provisions. Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, chief of the joint chiefs of staff, nevertheless called the accords `` a big political defeat for the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>.'' The accords `` vehemently urge'' the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> to agree to an `` immediate and effective cease-fire.'' The rebels, in Tuesday's broadcast, did not respond to that demand <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said it was positive that <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s conflict was recognized at the summit. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> had indicated he would try to link demobilization of the Contras to demobilization of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> during the summit. Ungo and other leftist leaders applauded his decision not to do that. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Colindres </PERSON>, former chief of staff to <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who preceded <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> as president, also considered the <PERSON> Tela </PERSON> accords positive. `` They oblige <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> to fulfill commitments to strengthening democracy,'' he said. Both Ungo and <PERSON> Colindres </PERSON> noted the opposition's recent efforts to get negotiations going between the government and the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, of the rightist <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> party, in his inaugural address offered to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, but proposed a non-governmental commission for such talks. The rebels rejected that mechanism as dilatory and doomed to failure. Upon his return from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> Monday night the president said he now is willing to enter into a direct dialogue with the rebels.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday asked a federal judge to force the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to require <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> shrimpers to equip their nets with turtle excluder devices. The department's temporary new regulations limiting trawl times do not protect endangered sea turtles as the department claims, the federation argued. The federation said it has learned that <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> has data from <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> scientists that demonstrates the mortality rate from a 105-minute tow time is more than four times greater than what the secretary has admitted. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> on Monday promulgated regulations requiring shrimpers to lift their nets every 105 minutes to let any captured turtles escape. `` A recent report from the team of scientists charged with managing recovery efforts for the severely endangered <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> sea turtle states unequivocally that the species is physiologically unable to withstand tow times in lieu of of required -LRB- excluder -RRB- use,'' the federation said in its petition to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> is overseeing the federation's legal attack on <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s failure to require excluder devices Commerce spokesman <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Boatright </PERSON> said he did not want to comment on the lawsuit now that <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> has a new petition before him. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> last week ordered <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> to adopt regulations of some sort by Monday to protect sea turtles from drowning in shrimpers' nets A new federal law last year requires shrimpers to use excluder devices _ big boxes attached to nets with hinged sides that turtles can swim through _ unless the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> commerce </ORGANIZATION> has good reason to require other protective measures. The trawling regulation is to last only until Sept. 7 while the department solicits comment on what permanent regulations to adopt `` in light of conservation needs of sea turtle populations and the economics of the shrimp fishing industry.'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s decided July 24 to suspend requirements for excluder devices after <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> shrimpers protested their use by blockading Gulf Coast shipping channels. The shrimpers argue that the devices reduce their catch by as much as a third. About 40 people organized by <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> protested the trawling rules in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday morning, chanting `` <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, hear our plea, save the turtles in the sea,'' and carrying posters with slogans like `` Shrimpers are crying but turtles are dying.'' Faced with <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s suspension, the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> decided to proceed on its own. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and his cabinet on Tuesday unanimously approved new regulations requiring vessels more than 25 feet long using <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> waters to use excluder devices, and shorter vessels to limit trawls to 90 minutes. The governor and cabinet rejected requests for a delay to permit a court challenge. <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> shrimpers largely have agreed to use the devices, environmentalists say.

 The floating oil rig that capsized in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> last week, killing as many as 10 men, had toppled before, its owner said Tuesday. `` I learned after buying it that it turned over at sea trial,'' said <PERSON> Avis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Avco </ORGANIZATION> 5 `` liftboat.'' The rig was modified after that accident, he said. <PERSON> Bourg </PERSON> was the first witness at a hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> into the July 31 accident, in which the boat-like rig overturned as it headed for shore to escape Hurricane Chantal. A fishing boat and helicopter rescued four people. Divers for <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, which leased the rig from <LOCATION> Bourg </LOCATION>, later recovered four bodies. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> abandoned the search with six still missing. At the hearing, Capt. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> gave the first public description of the 15-foot seas that knocked the vessel over and almost drowned him. `` The next thing I know, I was up to my neck in water in the wheelhouse,'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> testified. `` I started calling maydays. A surge blew me out the top of the wheelhouse, sucked me in and blew me out again. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Franklinton </LOCATION>, said he managed to swim to a lifeboat that was tied to the barge-like rig. Then he tried to swim to the capsized rig, but the waves kept knocking him back. He said he saw three others get out of the rig. By then the boat was completely on its side. A shrimp boat picked up <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> and two others, and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> rescued a fourth. <PERSON> Bourg </PERSON> said he bought the <ORGANIZATION> Avco </ORGANIZATION> 5 two years ago. He later learned it had capsized while being tested for seaworthiness eight years ago. The man he bought the boat from claimed to have spent $ 700,000 repairing the rig after the accident, <PERSON> Bourg </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Reish </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Bourg </PERSON> if he was concerned about the stability of the boat. `` No, I was not,'' <PERSON> Bourg </PERSON> answered. After the accident, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said liftboats have a record of instability and a new inspection program began the day the <ORGANIZATION> Avco </ORGANIZATION> 5 overturned. The hearing is expected to last all week. Survivors of the accident and rig owners are expected to testify. The rig is a floating platform with retractable legs. It can move through Gulf waters on its own power or extend its legs 100 feet to the sea bottom when it reaches a drilling site. At the time of the accident, it had been on a job about 25 miles off <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to work on oil pipes on the sea bottom.

 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area residents were jolted awake Tuesday by a sharp earthquake that broke windows, toppled groceries and startled a man into falling to his death from a fifth-story apartment window. The quake occurred as state and federal emergency services officials prepared to conduct a two-day test of their response to a catastrophic earthquake. The quake, which hit with a jolt and rolled for 10 seconds, caused only minor structural damage, but was felt as far away as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, about 230 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 60 miles to the north. The temblor struck at 1:13 a.m. and measured 5.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion. It was centered on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> fault about 15 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. A moderate aftershock measuring 4.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale struck at 1:44 a.m., followed by a second, stronger aftershock that measured 4.5 at 8:53 a.m., according to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. `` I thought all my windows were going to break,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` My whole bed was shaking.'' In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>, where the quake was centered, police reported that <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bignall </PERSON>, 19, accidentally jumped from his bedroom window after apparently being startled awake by the earthquake. <PERSON> Bignall </PERSON> died of multiple injuries, according to a spokeswoman with the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's office. Residents reported some broken windows and items falling off shelves but no major problems, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION> police dispatcher said. Damage was confined mostly to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> counties, according to the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. Experts warned that the seismic activity signals an increased chance that a severe earthquake will strike the area during the next week. `` It certainly shows us the fault is becoming more active,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> geophysicist, who said the quake was the largest in the area since 1969. `` The stress is building up in the earth and we're going to start getting large earthquakes,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. `` It should serve as a reminder to prepare.'' <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, 21, spent more than an hour cleaning up the paint store he manages in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>, where about 20 cans fell off shelves and four quarts of paint splattered on the floor. `` It made a nice little splotch mess,'' he said, estimating damage at about $ 300. The false ceiling in a vacant <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION> business came down, and about half a dozen businesses reported broken windows, police said. One of the front windows of a grocery store blew out, according <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieker </PERSON>, an assistant manager at the Safeway. She said she found `` red wine all over the floor'' when she arrived about 2 a.m. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> reported no major problems as a result of the quake. The earthquake drill involved a mock temblor in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area in which 5,000 people die. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, wife of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> to attend the first day of the test. When she woke up at 5:30 a.m. and saw coverage of the actual earthquake on television, she thought it was part of the exercise. `` I thought, ` Gee, this is pretty interesting. They have the -LRB- earthquake -RRB- simulation on television already,''' Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. The open-ended <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seisomograph. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Great Quake, which occurred in 1906 before the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3. Recent estimates say more than 2,000 people died in the quake and the fire it touched off, which burned much of the city. Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to 6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of 6.0 can cause severe damage. In March 1964 an earthquake in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> hit 8.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, killing 114 people.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers detained 29 Panamanians who entered a restricted military area Tuesday and released them after confiscating their weapons, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> reported. She said among those briefly detained were 10 officers and troopers of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, including Maj. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieiro </PERSON>. He is a brother in-law of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> who is commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and controls the government. The spokeswoman, <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, said five <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> journalists were among the civilians in the group. She said in a telephone interview the Panamanians were detained because `` they ventured without authorization into a military zone'' reserved exclusively for American forces. Ms. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said about 40 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines were conducting `` a reconnaissance exercise on roads'' leading to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> when the Panamanians entered the area in 15 vehicles. A number of submachine guns, rifles and pistols were confiscated and will be returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> through a U.S.-Panamanian coordinating commission in charge of handling problems related to the security and defense of the canal, Ms. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. She said the Panamanians were detained for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Ms. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was asked if the Panamanians were held at gunpoint and she said, `` The necessary security measures required in this case were taken.'' She refused to give further details. Mayor <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Santis </PERSON> of the town of <LOCATION> Arraijan </LOCATION>, 9 miles west of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and near the site where the incident occurred, said the Panamanians were `` stopped at gunpoint'' by the Marines and held for 2 hours and 45 minutes. He told reporters about 100 people demonstrated against the American troops as they passed through the town in six armored vehicles. The Panamaninan vehicles then appeared and followed the Americans, according to the mayor. He said that at a jungle area a few miles outside of town the American vehicles turned around and the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> surrounded the Panamanians `` at gunpoint'' and detained them. Sieiro is Defense Forces commander for the <LOCATION> Chorrera </LOCATION> military area, a few miles west of the capital and in the area where the incident took place. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined comment on the indicent. The Panamanian journalists asked that they not be identified by name. The incident is the latest in a series of confrontations between <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Panamanian troops in recent months. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in February 1988 by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last year when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> refused to step down. Most of the incidents between Panamanian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops involved the exchange of a few shots at nighttime and the occasional detention for a brief period of Americans by Panamanian police for alleged traffic violations. No one has been reported hurt. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of trying to force him to resign and replace him with a `` docile'' government to avoid turning the canal over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the years 2000 as stipulated in treaties signed in 1977. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> insists it has the right to conduct military exercises in defense of the canal under the treaties. The pro-Noriega news media calls the exercises a provocation.

 A fire raged out of control for three hours and gutted a dilapidated rooming house Tuesday, forcing tenants to swing from ropes and leap to neighboring roofs because there were no exterior fire escapes. Three people were killed, and at least five remained unaccounted for. The city had previously filed a criminal complaint against the owner of the <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Crest </PERSON> rooming house for failing to install a sprinkler system; a lawyer for the owner said installation of sprinklers was to have begun next week. Rescuers aided by a crane brought in to clear rubble from the four-story brick building recovered two bodies by Tuesday night but neither had been identified, said police Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>. The search was suspended shortly before 7 p.m. and was not expected to resume until late Wednesday morning, he said. The cause of the blaze was still being investigated. Early estimates put the number of registered guests and visitors at about 37, and initial reports indicated at least five people were unaccounted for, <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said. Survivors said an alarm failed to sound. `` I pulled on the fire alarm, and it broke right off in my hand,'' said <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, 25, a fourth-floor resident who tried to wake other tenants before escaping to an adjacent roof with <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON>, 46. `` We saw a couple of people that could n't reach the roof, and they got torched,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said they lost one elderly man they had awakened on their way out. `` I turned around and <PERSON> Scottie </PERSON> was n't there,'' <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON> said. `` There was n't anything more we could do.'' Thirty-five of the 40 rooms were rented Monday night, officials said. Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> said the city encourages exterior fire escapes, but they are not required. He said if there is no fire escape outside the window of a room, ropes are an acceptable alternative. Seven tenants and two police officers were injured, said police Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> said at least seven firefighters were injured, three seriously. The most seriously injured was a firefighter who broke his hip in a two-story fall while trying to rescue a woman who froze with fear at her window. Fire Chief <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Numberg </PERSON> said that when he arrived on the scene about 12:30 a.m., `` people were jumping out of windows ... climbing down on ropes that knotted up and never reached bottom.'' Tenants said screams filled the night. `` It was n't screams of help, it was more like screams of burning,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, 19. One victim died at the feet of the first officer on the scene after jumping from a second-story window to escape the flames, <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. The other two confirmed casualties were visible to firefighters through upper-story windows. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> DiVirgilio </PERSON>, mayor of this decaying city of 80,000 on the seacoast five miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said two criminal complaints were pending against the rooming house. One citation involved an illegal woodshop in the basement of the building, which housed retail space on the first floor. The other, however, involved the owner's failure to install a sprinkler system required under a 2-year-old city ordinance adopted after a 1984 rooming house fire in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> that killed 15, the mayor said. The <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Crest </PERSON>'s owner, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Allard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nahant </LOCATION>, has been battling the ordinance in court. <PERSON> Allard </PERSON> refused to comment Tuesday on anything relating to the ordinance or the fire. His attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said his client and other rooming house owners were only seeking reasonable time to install sprinkler systems, and he said work on a system at the <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> was due to begin next week. Second-floor resident <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, 53, nursed his right hand which was raw and sore from sliding down a rope. `` I could only hold on about half-way, so I jumped the rest of the way,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said.

 Mexican newspapers said Tuesday a visit by senior <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials marked a new cordiality in relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but some said it could be just a honeymoon between new governments. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> headed a delegation of 40 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including four Cabinet members, at talks with Mexican officials Monday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was quoted as saying no friendship was more important to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than that with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The unusually large delegation followed the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's support of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in reaching an agreement with foreign creditor banks on reduction of its $ 107 billion foreign debt. `` A spirit of greater understanding toward <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was expressed. ... There is hope that this meeting is the beginning of a new era,'' El Universal newspaper wrote. In a front-page editorial, the daily Uno mas Uno said, `` Evidently relations are on a very distinct level from the tension that characterized relations with the government of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials frequently accused <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of failing to take sufficient action to stop drug trafficking, of official corruption and of failing to support <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper most critical of the Mexican government and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said both administrations were new and there had n't been time to discover more profound differences. Excelsior, one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest newspapers, questioned the depth of the new harmony. `` Will all this be reality or just ... wishful thinking?'' asked columnist <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbarena </PERSON>. He said that on Monday both sides skirted thorny issues such as <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and illegal <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> aliens in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said the talks produced nothing concrete in narcotics control or financial questions. An editorial in the same paper said, `` The dangers persist that bilateral relations will take a distinct turn from what is anticipated.'' In the weeks leading up to the debt settlement, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> took numerous steps to assuage <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s major complaints. Corrupt union leaders were arrested, a drug kingpin was jailed and foreign investment restrictions were relaxed.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday rejected any suggestion tying the fate of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to billions of dollars of Iranian assets frozen in this country for nearly a decade. `` The questions of the assets have no connection or linkage whatsoever with the hostage issue,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said at a briefing for reporters. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>'s comments came in response to a report in the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which quoted a source as saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would definitely intercede to gain the release of the hostages if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> gave assurances it would release frozen Iranian assets. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assurances that the assets will be released `` should be concrete and there should be convincing grounds that these proposals will be translated into action,'' the unidentified source told the newspaper. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` There have been a good many messages back and forth between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through various intermediaries over the last many days. We wo n't comment on the specifics and would n't comment on whether or not they mentioned the assets in particular. But he added that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> `` has mentioned that publicly before, so it's not a secret matter and we've answered it publicly before, and since then I would say that there's no change on either side in that equation.'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, repeating the long-held <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position, said the assets were in no way related to eight American hostages who are believed to be held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials continue with their `` intensive diplomatic efforts'' to free the hostages. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> noted that claims against the assets are pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Iran-U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The tribunal, set up in 1981 after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> freed American hostages held at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, has carried out its work in a non-political environment, officials said. `` What is really unique is that it is resolving a whole host, a class, of tough technical issues between all kinds of claimants,'' said one department official who, like others, asked that he not be identified. Since it was established, the tribunal _ composed of nine international judges _ has resolved billions of dollars worth of claims stemming from the rupture in diplomatic relations between the two nations in 1979. At the time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> froze Iranian assets, including hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military equipment purchased by <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> before his regime was toppled. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also seized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets, many belonging to American firms. When the tribunal was established in 1981, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> transferred $ 9.9 billion in frozen assets to its supervision. Some $ 3.8 billion was transferred to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, with the rest going to various escrow accounts under the tribunal, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Interest on the escrow accounts amounts to more than $ 1.3 billion, the department said. Although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has little control over assets controlled by the tribunal, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has made claims against the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for other money, specifically for military hardware it says was paid for but not received. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> now claims claims that money amounts to $ 12 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it could not determined the amount the shah paid upfront for equipment. The shah had contracted for $ 20 billion in equipment by 1979, the department said. In August 1979, the revolutionary government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced that it was canceling $ 9 billion worth of arms contracts with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

Some American companies, however, have appealed the tribunal's decision in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts, effectively delaying payments, they said.

 The race for mayor of this glittering, crime-plagued Southern capital became a one-man show Tuesday when former Mayor <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s only opponent quit the campaign. `` I have decided that my greatest service now is to ensure that this campaign does not divide our city's families,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> chairman. <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> told reporters he believed he might have been able to win by pounding on the crime issue that has been his major campaign theme. But, he said, `` I felt that it would have been too costly a victory, and that's why I stepped aside.'' He stopped short of endorsing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but said he pledged to work with him. `` I have extended the olive branch,'' he said. `` I believe he will be generous enough of spirit to receive it.'' The non-partisan election is Oct. 3 to succeed Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who can not serve a third consecutive term. <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said earlier Tuesday that <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> decided to quit the race because of his poor showing in recent polls. `` The decision has been made that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> just ca n't win. Even though the gap has narrowed, it has n't narrowed enough,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was not ready to assume the mayor's job was his. `` I do n't want to take anything for granted. Never, ever do that,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said after a speech to a business group Tuesday. Both <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are black Democrats, but the key to <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>'s chances was the white, conservative business community that is a powerful minority in predominantly black <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who became the city's first black mayor in 1974 and served two four-year terms, was often at odds with the business establishment. But campaign aides say his support among whites this year is better than in either of his previous two races. <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> tried and failed to capitalize on <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s crime rate, ranked worst in the nation in the latest <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> survey. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, meanwhile, pledged not to let the city's ongoing construction and business boom overrun neighborhoods. <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>'s withdrawal allows him to keep his job as chairman of the county commission, which he would have been forced to give up next Wednesday at the mayor's race qualifying deadline. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was mayor during <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s string of child slayings and also endured a police department scandal over cheating on promotion exams, but he was widely credited with adopting progressive race relations policies that opened the doors of City Hall to blacks and women. He refused to hold city functions at any organization that discriminated against minorities and began the city's affirmative action policies in contracts.

 Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutein </PERSON> was the apparent winner of Tuesday's special election in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> called to fill the seat of ousted Republican Sen. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapp </PERSON>, an election official said.

Independent <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> came in second with 1,113, she said. Three other candidates trailed far behind. A victory by <PERSON> Tutein </PERSON> would increase the Democratic majority to 10-5.

 A 9-year-old girl contracted AIDS by being sexually abused by her mother and was reportedly injected with drugs as punishment, state social workers said. The girl has been taken into custody by the state and placed in foster care with a family who knows her, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` From everything we can determine from the circumstances, it appears to be she got it -LRB- AIDS -RRB- from abuse,'' he said Monday. `` Everybody just wants to give her the best we can give her in the time she has,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. `` She is with the person she wants to be with and if that works out, there is no reason to move her.'' The girl's mother, a drug abuser, died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Social workers believe she is the person who sexually abused the girl and gave her drug injections as a form of punishment. Authorities held a closed-door hearing Monday concerning the girl. District Judge <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickhoff </PERSON> said the hearing was closed because of a law requiring confidentiality in AIDS cases. After her mother's death, the girl was left to live with relatives. Social workers were concerned those surroundings were further endangering her life, so they obtained an emergency court order to remove the girl and place her in foster care.

 A group of striking teachers invaded the Nicaraguan Embassy Tuesday, remaining there for about an hour, and other teachers battled police near the National Palace. Police spokesman <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Molliendo </PERSON> said the street clash started when about 20 teachers, demonstrating outside the palace, insulted police patrols. He said police moved in to disperse the strikers and one teacher was arrested for smashing shop windows with a piece of metal.

Strike organizers said some 100 teachers entered the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and asked embassy officials to intercede with President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> to grant their demands. An estimaed 800 students supporting the teachers' strike blocked traffic in a town 125 miles north of the capital and occupied a court building. Other students threw nails on the highway between <LOCATION> Huehuetenango </LOCATION> and La Mesita near the Mexican border, puncturing tires and blocking traffic, according to police. The nation's 35,000 elementary and high school teachers left their jobs Monday defying a labor court ruling that declared the strike illegal. The public school teachers began job actions May 1, demanding a monthly increase of $ 80 in their salaries. They currently make from $ 136 to $ 328 a month plus a flat bonus of $ 70 monthly. The teachers have been joined occasionally by 15,000 other government employees and there have been almost daily marches and demonstrations in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION> and the French city of <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> announced record bids Tuesday to stage the 1990 World Chess Championship final. The host for the 10-week contest will be decided Wednesday by a vote of the 89 delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting being held in this city on <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s western coast In a potentially explosive move the federation decided Tuesday to choose the venue for the final without consulting the players. <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION> offered prize money of 3 million Swiss francs, about $ 1.8 million, plus $ 37,000 for the federation's fund to promote the game in developing countries. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> offered the same prize fund and a trophy encrusted with diamonds and gold valued at $ 93,000, for the winner. According to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> rules, up to 20 percent of the total world championship prizes will go to its fund for developing nations. `` This is a window of opportunity for chess in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Gillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Houser </PERSON>, representing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Organizing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told delegates. The French bid was supported by former Soviet world champion <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Spassky </PERSON>, who now lives in and plays for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The 1987 title dual in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, between <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> and fellow Soviet <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> raised a record of 2.85 million Swiss francs, then about $ 1.8 million. Delegates to the 124-member <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> decided by a vote of 59-6 with 12 abstentions to change the rules governing the choice of venue. In recent contests the title-holder and challenger have visited the prospective venues before stating their preferences. In 1987, <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> chose different cities and the match was awarded to the highest bidder, <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>. The rule change means the host city for the 1990 final will be chosen without consulting the champion, <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, or his challenger, who will be known after the final qualifying match next March. In a further attempt to impose its authority over the leading grandmasters, the Federation also decided that each player must accept match conditions within 28 days of the qualifying final. If either the champion or challenger refuses his place will be taken up by a reserve.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> accountant was named Tuesday in a federal lawsuit seeking to recover more than $ 1 million in funds allegedly diverted from the beleaguered agency. The lawsuit contends <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> diverted to the bank account of his company, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> View </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1,006,130 in federal funds intended to assist low-income facilities in obtaining housing. The company also is named as a defendant. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> and acting Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiffer </PERSON> said the complaint seeks damages arising from false statements that <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> allegedly made and for alleged false record keeping by Green View. Turner allegedly used the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money in <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> View </ORGANIZATION>'s account to purchase land in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>, to pay a contractor to build a house on the property and to buy a car. `` We'll move for a default judgment and seek damages, but we want equitable transfer of the funds back to the federal government,'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said. The case against <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> began when a Denver-area <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> auditor discovered the alleged diversions after finding payment requests for <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> View </ORGANIZATION> assigned to a project that was off the agency's rolls Turner was suspended without pay on June 4 and the unfinished house caught the attention of federal agents. Agents said the house is located in a neighborhood where lots run between $ 35,000 and $ 45,000, and homes from $ 170,000 to $ 750,000. The lawsuit is the result of a detailed investigation performed by the Office of the Inspector General, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>. Sources said the alleged theft occurred in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Section 8 rent-subsidy program, which gives developers subsidies to build housing for low-income people. The inquiry overlaps a probe by auditor's from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> and Accounting of fraud and embezzlement in the sale of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> foreclosed homes. Nationwide, about 80 branch offices are being examined. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunette </PERSON>, top aide to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, reported in June that the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> accountant allegedly directed Section 8 payments through an automated cash transfer system, from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> into his bank account.

 Four people remained hospitalized Tuesday after a hailstorm drenched a Lutheran youth prayer service at an outdoor amphitheater, sending 130 people to hospitals for hypothermia and other problems.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> store </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> chain </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has agreed to change its policy of charging customers for alterations on skirts and dresses but not for fixing suits, blazers and slacks. The out-of-court action settles a class action discrimination lawsuit filed by <PERSON> Muriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viejo </ORGANIZATION>, who bought dresses and were charged $ 40 each for alterations. At the same time, the ritzy department store was tailoring suits, slacks and blazers for free. `` We are now adding several free alterations on dresses and skirts, and we will continue to review the policy for similar appropriate revisions,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> store in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mabry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> took their case to feminist attorney <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>, who accused <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> of illegal discrimination and asked the court to issue an injunction that would force the store to charge equally for alterations. The suit also sought $ 250 for each woman hurt by <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>' bias over the past three years. <PERSON> Allred </PERSON> said the suit, filed Sept. 8, 1988, was resolved amicably. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Acton </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>, maintained that there had not been the issue of a double standard involved and that no damages were paid. <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` has never had a double standard so it ca n't agree to end one. He explained that the store previously charged for work done on dresses and skirts because of the work involved. However, he said there was no charge for clothing that was considered `` unisex.'' Since 1980, he said there has been no charge for `` courtesy'' work on slacks or blazers done for men or women. As a result of the settlement, however, the company decided to `` take a second look'' at its policy of charging for alterations done on skirts and dresses, <PERSON> Acton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Allred </PERSON> lauded <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>' change in policy at a news conference Tuesday. `` <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>' response to the plaintiffs' suit could serve as a model for the industry. As a major force in the American fashion industry, <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> is sensitive to issues that affect women,'' <PERSON> Allred </PERSON> said outside the <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> store in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. Many department stores charge women, but not men, for alterations. Others sometimes charge men a small fee for major alterations. `` Hopefully, other large retail chains will follow suit, and if they do not, we expect that other women will file lawsuits as we did,'' <PERSON> Mabry </PERSON> said, adding the victory `` is especially sweet in that two women, size 2 and 4, could take such a big issue and prevail.''

 Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and other anti-apartheid leaders demonstrated Tuesday in support of a national defiance campaign. Police reported widespread student unrest in townships near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> was among several opposition clergymen and academics who addressed a church service held in solidarity with former detainees who have begun defying restrictions imposed by police following their release. The black Anglican archbishop, the 1984 Nobel Peace laureate, joined about 60 people in a demonstration outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION>'s Cathedral after the service Outdoor protest demonstrations are illegal, but police did not intervene. Hundreds of activists released from detention this year were served with restriction orders requiring them to be at home each night and to report daily to local police stations. Many were banned from political activities. On Sunday, 21 <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> area activists said they would defy their restrictions. Other former detainees are expected to join them on Aug. 20 as part of a defiance campaign begun this month by the anti-apartheid movement. In mixed-race townships near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, students supporting the campaign have been staging protests and erecting street barricades. Several large rallies were held Tuesday. Police headquarters said officers fired tear gas in three incidents Monday to disperse crowds of students. One delivery van was firebombed, and other vehicles were stoned, police said. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON>, a police spokesman, said, `` We can expect the unrest will increase toward the elections.'' Parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held Sept. 6. Residents of <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON>, a ramshackle rural black township, meanwhile won a potentially decisive court victory in their long-running struggle against government efforts to relocate them, their lawyer, <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Budlender </PERSON>, said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Kees </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> ruled Monday that the government acted improperly last year when it declared the 55-year-old township an `` emergency camp.'' Under terms of the declaration, rents in <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> were raised by more than 50 percent, unauthorized visitors were barred, and permits were required to renovate homes. Civil rights workers said the declaration was imposed to make life so miserable <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> residents would leave voluntarily. Government lawyers said Tuesday they would appeal. White authorities have tried for years to coax or coerce the approximately 6,000 residents of <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> into moving to a newer township 12 miles away. The official reason for <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON>'s intended demise is that the government considers it an unhealthy slum. Residents believe the real reason is that <PERSON> Oukasie </PERSON> is a few hundred yards from the white suburb of Brits.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is offering rewards for pieces of the jet engine from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 that broke up over western <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said Tuesday that handbills have been distributed in an area of western <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> where parts of the engine may have landed to keep up interest in the search. The engine parts are key in discovering why the DC-10 experienced engine trouble and lost almost all of its steering control when hydraulic lines were cut. The planes crew managed to guide the jumbo jet to <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and attempted an emergency landing. The fiery, tumbling crash killed 111 people of the 296 on board. Sweeps by military aircraft over the area to try to find engine fragments ended Friday, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> D.C. Officials said they are not planning a ground search of pastures and fields in <LOCATION> Buena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` It's a big area out there,'' said <LOCATION> Buena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON>. `` It's kind of a sit-and-wait situation right now.'' GE, the manufacturer of the jet's engine, will offer rewards through the end of August for rotating parts from the engine, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his office in <LOCATION> Evendale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` A representative authorized by the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> will look at each of the recovered parts,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. `` A representative of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> will determine the level of reward.'' <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> said GE distributed the information last week to property owners and farmers. He said the fliers specify the reward is for engine parts and offer as much as $ 1,000 for some of the parts. The search has been concentrated 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Parts have continued to turn up, officials said. On Thursday, a farmer found fragments of a jet fan blade while working in a hay field, <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> said. One fragment measured 10 by 12 inches. <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said a titanium fan disk and a shaft from the engine have not been located. Investigators have said that finding the disk and shaft would help them determine what caused the engine to malfunction. Investigators hope harvests in late September will turn up more engine parts. <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said one <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator remains in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to wrap up the federal agency's crash-related work, but probably will return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a week.

 Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who denounced the May elections in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as a fraud, agreed Tuesday to lead a delegation to observe next winter's elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Tuesday he would assemble a 20-member delegation which will visit <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at least once before the Feb. 25 elections. `` I will make sure that the members of my delegation will not interfere in the internal affairs of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and we will be impartial with respect to the candidates and parties competing for the election,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and a group of Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leaders had received separate invitations to observe the elections from President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiallos </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and from <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tablada </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelaya </PERSON> on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, in a letter dated Aug. 3, invited <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to `` observe our electoral process from beginning to end'' and said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s delegation `` will have unrestricted access to all aspects of the process. <PERSON> Fiallos </PERSON>' invitation promised free access to `` all the Electoral Council's information.''

<HEAD>South Pacific Islanders Keep Watch on Greenhouse Effect</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FUNAFUTI, Tuvalu (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When storms roll in the from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, the people of <LOCATION> Tuvalu </LOCATION> look carefully at the waves in the lagoon for signs of the greenhouse effect. One day it could be a matter of the survival of their island nation. A slight rise in the sea level caused by man-made gases warming the atmosphere and melting polar ice would send storm waves crashing over this atoll where the highest point is only 12 feet above sea level. At its narrowest this nation of eight inhabited coral atolls with a population of 8,000 is only the width of a golf course fairway. Already in stormy weather, wind-driven waves break over the seawall, into the hotel and over the front lawns of houses. Tuvaluans remember the 1972 hurricane that flattened every house, toppled coconut trees and sent waves smashing across the island. `` People had to cling to coconut trees to stop being washed away,'' said Prime Minister <PERSON> Tomasi </PERSON> <PERSON> Puapua </PERSON>. `` It was very frightening. That's why we are so worried about the greenhouse effect. Old men say that now the winds from the west are stronger than they were in past days.'' <PERSON> Puapua </PERSON> said his four-man government was doing its best to keep up with the latest research on the greenhouse effect. But this is difficult because <LOCATION> Tuvalu </LOCATION>, in the central Pacific midway between <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, has no newspapers, no television and only four hours of local radio broadcasting a day. Scientists predict the emissions of man-made gases from the world's industrial complexes and automobiles could warm the atmosphere, melt the polar ice cap and raise sea levels six inches to 4.5 feet by the year 2030. `` Our country would disappear,'' <PERSON> Puapua </PERSON> said. `` Other countries would have flooding but we would be swamped. We would have to leave.'' <PERSON> Puapua </PERSON> said he welcomed an Australian offer to spend $ 4.8 million on a network of scientific stations around the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> to monitor sea levels, tides, atmopsheric pressures, temperatures and weather. <PERSON> Puapua </PERSON> holds some optimism about the future of <LOCATION> Tuvalu </LOCATION>, which became independent from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1978. `` This greenhouse may not happen,'' he said. `` We do n't know. We hope the scientists are wrong. But we do n't want to spend the next 50 years worrying about it. There's no need to panic.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> recently told <PERSON> Puapua </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Ieremia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabai </PERSON> of neighboring <LOCATION> Kiribati </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> would consider resettling their populations if their islands had to be evacuated. `` But I do n't want to go,'' <PERSON> Puapua </PERSON> said. Meantime, <PERSON> Puapua </PERSON> and his government are moving ahead with development of the country, formerly known as the <LOCATION> Ellice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, which occupies just 16 square miles of dry land and is so poor it is likely to remain dependent on outside aid forever, according to a recent Australian parliamentary inquiry on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tuvalu </LOCATION> gets $ 688 per capita in aid, the highest in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. It has a per capita gross national product of $ 570. Despite the absence of resources, the government is planning to pave the airport's 1,200-foot grass runway in the hope of attracting tourists. This would interfere with <LOCATION> Tuvalu </LOCATION>'s soccer competititon because games are played on the airstrip. A siren sounds 10 minutes before the twice-weekly flights arrive to give the players time to take down the goal posts and move their bicycles. Paving the runway, which takes up half the land area of <LOCATION> Funafuti </LOCATION>, will mean the prison would have to be moved. But it recently had only six prisoners, all serving time for being drunk and disorderly. Police Comissioner <PERSON> Saloa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauia </PERSON> said there have been only two murders in his 33 years in the force. Although most of the population of Polynesian islanders live at subsistence level, they make a little money from stamp sales, handicrafts, copra sales and fishing. Most of their revenue comes from graduates of the marine academy who work as seamen on British and German merchant ships. But to cut costs the Germans recently reduced the salaries of Tuvaluan seamen by two-thirds to $ 145 a month. The Tuvaluans recently turned down an offer of 500 bicycles from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> because they had nowhere to store them and were concerned they would rust in the salty air. In any case, they do n't like taking aid and rather than take handouts each year, they established the <LOCATION> Tuvalu </LOCATION> Trust Fund with $ 30 million in contributions from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. The money is invested and managed by an indpedendent board. The interest is used to pay the government's expenditures. `` We would like to be independent financially,'' <PERSON> Puapua </PERSON> said. `` But it is doubtful we can ever achieve that. So we would like to live peacefully. We say, Do n't worry. Be happy.''

 The logo of <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>'s new production company, making its debut in the fall, will be an animated 50-year-old picture of his violinist father. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>, who died in 1977, was in part the inspiration for the first series from <ORGANIZATION> Steven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bochco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, `` <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howser </PERSON>, M.D.,'' a half-hour comedy-drama about a 16-year-old doctor. The show will premiere this fall on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, the first production from <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>'s 10-series deal with the network. `` I've sort of always been interested in prodigies,'' <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> told a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` My dad was a prodigy. And he was a violinist. It's just a fascinating kind of freak of nature. They do n't really understand why it happens.'' Prodigies were on <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>'s mind when he hit upon `` the notion of a kid who by virtue of very specific circumstances had all of those prodigious abilities kind of laser-focused onto medicine. ... `` I think a show like this, assuming an audience accepts the fundamental premise, can be very entertaining for years to come. Whether other people find it as intrinsically interesting as I do _ gee, I do n't know. I hope they do.'' <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> said he approached a doctor friend and asked, would it be possible for a 16-year-old to practice medicine. `` He said, well, I do n't know but let me look into this, and I'll get back to you. He got back to me a day or two later. There are absolutely no restrictions whatsoever on anybody of any age who has completed the required educational training to practice medicine. `` I said, you mean to tell me that a boy of 16, who ca n't go into a grocery store and buy a six-pack of beer can write a prescription for morphine?'' It might be technically feasible for a 16-year-old genius to work as a doctor, but it remains to be seen whether audiences will buy the premise, packaged as it is as a half-hour `` dramedy.'' The form has failed to win high Nielsen ratings in the past. <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>'s own `` Hooperman'' lasted only two seasons, but that made it the longest-running of the batch of dramedies that showed up a couple of years ago -LRB- Except for `` The Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>,'' but that show had to move to cable to stay in production. -RRB- <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> has not given up on the format. `` People have only been attempting these kinds of half-hours for a short time, and it's not unexpected that the majority of them, like the majority of everything else, will fail. I continue to believe it's an extremely viable form,'' he said. `` ... I mean, I think ` Wonder Years' is a real successful show, and I do n't think it falls into a typical half-hour sitcom format.'' In the pilot, <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON>, played by newcomer <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, kisses his first girl and suffers his first crisis as a physician, ending the episode on a distinctly bittersweet note. His parents are played by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikking </PERSON> -LRB- `` Hill Street Blues'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>'s ex-wife in `` Miami Vice.'' <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> said subsequent episodes will not be as heavy on the drama as the pilot, but he felt a serious approach was necessary at the outset to establish the `` credibility'' of the premise, to demonstrate that the show's aim was not simply `` giggle, giggle, laugh, laugh about a 16-year-old doctor.'' <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> said his deal with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will progress slowly _ `` I'm going to try very hard to do no more than one project per season.'' And he is still somewhat involved with his <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> creation, `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' though not on a day-to-day basis. He would n't elaborate on any future projects except to say, `` There's one hour show that I desperately want to attempt to do. Hopefully, in the next year and a half we'll manage to do it. Other than that, I have no ideas for anything.''

<HEAD>One Shock After Another</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 American economic history in recent years is recorded in a series of shocks, but the encouraging lesson that might be drawn from them is that somehow the country has survived them all. More are coming, accompanied by alarming predictions about the decline of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. There is, for instance, the coming of a united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1992, viewed by alarmists as a fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that will exclude <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods. Before that time arrives, however, we must contend with the alarming report issued after the big stock market bust of 1987, in which 33 economists from 13 countries said the world economy was in the worst mess since the 1930s. The crash, the esteemed economists said, was attributable to the existence of major and unsustainable imbalances in the world economy, the most glaring of which was the growing indebtedness of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Unless more decisive action is taken to correct existing imbalances at their roots, the next few years could be the most troubled since the 1930s,'' they stated in their report, `` The Global Economic Crisis: After Wall Street.'' Theirs was not the first warning about imbalances. Throughout the 1980s publications flapped the storm flags about ruinous inflation, soaring interest rates, energy shortages and credit crunches. The common theme was <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> living beyond its means. The forecast: Collapse. Before that, in 1979, President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> delivered his malaise speech. Americans suffered a crisis of confidence, he said. They doubted the purpose and meaning of their own lives. They had lost their sense of national unity. Delivered from the heights of the presidency itself, from a leader expected to correct such defects of spirit, the speech was demoralizing. Some who did n't feel dispirited before the speech might have felt that way afterwards. It was a time of other crises too, especially that produced by the high price of imported oil. Can anybody forget the grim warnings of disaster, of an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> unable to compete in the world because it had been outfoxed by <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>? If problems with oil would n't do <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in, then the Japanese would. Why it was demonstrated in showrooms all over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: The Japanese produced better cars and lower prices and beat <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s own territory. Americans did everything wrong. They consumed instead of produced, spent instead of saved, wasted time instead of putting their noses to the grindstone, indulged themselves in the present instead of planning for the future.

The entire world, he indicates, may be reaching for another level of achievement. It is a dynamic one in which problems are more transitory than permanent, and become resolved eventually rather than allowed to destroy. Americans have n't saved? Yes, he concedes. Americans were young and in a consuming mood. Now that they are growing a bit older they will save. Emerging economies in contrast will take to spending like Americans used to. In a dynamic world problems are n't necessarily permanent or reflective of national weaknesses. `` The pessimists are n't seeing the big global picture,'' he says. `` Communism has failed. Capitalism has triumphed. By 1993, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government bonds should yield 5 percent and the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average should be at 5000,'' which is a way of saying <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will prevail.

 When <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> visit their 32-year-old daughter in her bright, private room at the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, they ca n't help wonder what she would tell them if she could speak. `` She would say, ` Pull the plug, stop it. I do n't want to live like this. I have no dignity,''' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> said during a visit to the hospital where <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> has lain comatose for six years. `` I think that probably would be the key word, no dignity. `` She used to come to me and say, ` Dad, my car is not running very well,' and I would fix it for her. Now, it's ` Dad, I'm in a situation that I ca n't help. Can you do something for me?''' So far, the answer has been no. The Cruzans hope that will change this fall when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rules on their request to remove feeding tubes that sustain <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s life. The case is the first time the court has agreed to consider the troubling issue of when it is appropriate to stop medical treatment _ to pull the plug on a life. The Cruzans' world changed forever on Jan. 11, 1983. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, driving home from work, lost control of her car and it overturned. At first she was presumed dead; by the time paramedics revived her, she had irreparable brain damage. Ever since, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> has been in what doctors call a `` persistent vegetative state.'' Lying in bed in a small, fourth-floor room, she breathes on her own but by all accounts is unaware of her surroundings. Birthday and greeting cards are taped to a window; a wide-brimmed straw hat with ribbons hangs near the door. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s body is stiff and her hands so contracted that her fingernails cut into her wrist if not trimmed. Her eyes are sometimes open, roaming aimlessly, but she does not respond to voices or gestures. The Cruzans visit weekly. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> makes colorful gowns for her daughter to wear instead of drab, hospital-issued clothing. She used to talk to her daughter during those visits, but not so much anymore. `` It's always been an exercise in futility. It's always been more for me. I used to come in and tell her everything and now sometimes I tell her stuff. Sometimes, I just brush her hair and sit and touch her.'' Medical experts say <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> could live another 30 or 40 years, as long as she is given food and water through a feeding tube implanted in her stomach. The Cruzans, who live in <LOCATION> Carterville </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, have fought for approval to remove the tube. A state court judge said a year ago they could ask the hospital to remove the feeding tube. But the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned that decision in a 5-4 ruling last fall. Acting as her guardians, the <ORGANIZATION> Cruzans </ORGANIZATION> appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to hear the case in November or December. No federal appellate court has ruled directly on the issue and opinions are split at the state level. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> high courts have ruled that such patients retain a federal constitutional right to refuse such treatment, including feeding, while <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ruled to the contrary, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Cruzans </ORGANIZATION>' attorney. In the most famous right-to-die case, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1976 that <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> had a right to take their comatose daughter, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, off a respirator. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declined to review the case and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> died at age 31 in 1985, nine years after her respirator was removed. The Cruzans, like the Quinlans, want to remember their daughter as she was before her accident _ an independent young woman who enjoyed life. `` If she had her way, she'd like to come back like she was,'' said <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>, 55, a sheet metal worker. `` That's what I wish, but it's not going to happen.'' The crux of the <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> case is the lack of a state law allowing removal of food and water in such cases. In fact, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> high court noted the state living will statute prohibits such removal from terminaly ill patients. While the statute never was an issue in the case and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> is not terminally ill, it is important because it reflects the state's policy of not including food and water as medical treatment that can be withdrawn. <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> is optimistic the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will rule in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Cruzans </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's an important part of our country's traditions that recognizes the sanctity of the family,'' he said. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will continue to recognize the importance of the family in our case.'' The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> `` improperly discounted the rights of the individual'' in the 14th Amendment, he said. That amendment says no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process. `` Within this concept of individual liberty is the right for that person to accept or reject invasive medical treatment,'' <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> said. Missouri Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, while sympathetic to the family, disagreed with <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>'s interpretation. `` We do n't believe the 14th Amendment extends the right to privacy to remove food and water in this case. The issue, he said, is `` whether the constitutional right of privacy extends to the right of a third party, when the patient is not terminally ill, to withdraw nutrition and hydration from an incompetent ward of the state.'' The Legislature could pass a statute allowing the removal of food and water from patients like Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>, although lawmakers this year refused to act on such a measure, he said. `` I ca n't project how I would feel if I was in their circumstances I do n't know if anybody can `` But I'm not sure if the tragic nature of the circumstances gives rise to argue a constitutional right of privacy where the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has been silent on the issue and the words do n't appear in the Constitution. The ordeal has taken its toll on the family. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> has trouble sleeping and his wife has taken medication to fight depression. `` It's always there, just below the surface,'' <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> said. `` When you go to bed at night and the first thing usually when you wake up in the morning.''

 On the first day without wakes or funerals since the tragedy, children are running in the farmyard, spraying each other with a garden hose while their mothers shout for them to cut it out. It would be a normal day but for one thing. <PERSON> Elmbrook </PERSON>, the dairy farm nurtured by five generations of Theuerkauf men over 108 years, has no one to run it save for the widows and children. Inside the great, white farmhouse, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Theuerkauf </PERSON> and her children gather in a circle, surrounded by memories, and say the names: `` First Tom ...'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Theuerkauf </PERSON>, 27, was the first one into the manure pit, through a narrow hole and down the ladder to clear the drain 12 feet below. `` ... then <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> ...'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Theuerkauf </PERSON>, 15, quiet and thoughtful like his uncle <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, had been cutting hay by himself for two years, already part of the circle of Theuerkauf farmers. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s head hit the ladder and slip into the dark. He sent his 8-year-old brother <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> for help and then went down. `` ... and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> got <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> first.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofer </PERSON>, 63, was the third man down, a cousin who grew up across the lane from the Theuerkaufs, went to school with them and farmed with them. `` ... and I got my Grandpa ...'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Theuerkauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 66 the day they buried him, a patriarch with a love for farming surpassed only by his passion for his family. He hated nothing more than when people would n't try, yet he once stopped <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> from running into a burning barn to save the cows, the farm equipment, the new tractor. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Theuerkauf </PERSON> remembers her son said, `` ` Spray me down <PERSON> Dad </PERSON> and I'll go in.' ... <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> said, ` No way, do n't risk your life for machines.''' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> stepped into the hole to save his son, grandson and cousin. `` ... and then my <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> finishes the toll. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Theuerkauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 37, was the last man down. `` I do n't know where he came from,'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> said. `` He was n't supposed to be on the farm that day. At first no one knew what had happened. Men went into that pit every week to clear the drain before the pump was turned on. But methane from the decaying sewage had built up during a heat wave; it took only seconds for each man to collapse, scant minutes to suffocate in air that contained no oxygen. The automatic waste pit was one innovation cited in 1981 when <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> the state Farm Manager of the Year. Over five generations, the Theuerkaufs -LRB- pronounced Turk' - off -RRB- built <LOCATION> Elmbrook </LOCATION> into the largest and most respected dairy farm in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s Gain the Theuerkaufs' trust and you had the ear of every farmer for 50 miles. Lose it, as one state ag man did, `` and your word is dirt,'' a county agent said. As their lives touched <LOCATION> Menominee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, so did their July 26 deaths. Newspapers carrying stories of the family sold out and people stood by the road in the rain when the funeral procession passed. Not since more than 700 people celebrated <PERSON> Elmbrook </PERSON>'s centennial a year ago July was there such a gathering <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> was so proud of that centennial he was near tears at the county fair last year when they handed him the historical marker. This year, the fair was deserted, what with the funerals and the rain. The same gloom hung over <LOCATION> Elmbrook </LOCATION>. A cow was loose in the back field. Two newborn calves lay untended in the mud of a holding pen. Thick, wet muck coated the stall floors in the dairy barn. No longer is <PERSON> Elmbrook </PERSON> a tight ship farmed by committee, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> and sons <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> meeting in the yard every morning, hands on hips, debating the day's work sometimes for an hour. Missing from those meetings was <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>'s third boy, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, a woodworker, not a farmer. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> once said he could handle anything, so long as it was n't a death, but he cried three years ago when he learned <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> had lost his hands in a car crash. <PERSON> Elmbrook </PERSON> still needs running. The pit, still waiting to be emptied, sits like a vault beneath the dairy barn and nobody will go near it. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, just 23 but aged incredibly, it seems, these past weeks, is taking a crash course in his family's occupation, scrambling between the paid hands and neighbors who volunteered to help. What are you doing? What must be done there? That does n't stop one of those raucous water fights with wet, laughing Theuerkauf children everywhere. They splash each other like they did just the Sunday before, when their fathers and brother were throwing water, too. That's the kind of thing the Theuerkaufs are keen to remember. There are the Sunday mornings, when <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> made waffles and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> would poke fun at her cooking. `` Tasteless, tasteless,'' he would say. There are the Sunday afternoons, when <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> drove alone to see the cornfields and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> would talk of plans for the future, the family, the farm. `` How <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> loved the farm. His dream was to make it the best farm it could be, so we could be together,'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> said. After the ambulances and the television crews, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> awoke in the dark. It was the hour <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> would be getting up, and she walked across the yard to the bright lights of the barn. `` I stood and watched the man milk the last six cows. It was 3 a.m. and I felt <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> there with me.'' She smiled. `` Do I hate the farm because of what happened? No.'' But that night after they died, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> hated <PERSON> Elmbrook </PERSON>. `` I just wanted to pack and move away and never come back.'' In the trailer next door, 5-year-old <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> promises <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>, he will take care of her. Two-year-old <PERSON> Rachael </PERSON> cries. At night, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s pet German shepherd whines softly. `` Even the dog is lost,'' <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> said. She does n't know if she will stay. `` I have to see what my kids say.'' What is the farm to them now? Pain? Love? Farming and <PERSON> Elmbrook </PERSON> remain life and love for <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s children The oldest, 16-year-old <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, sees her father and her brother <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> in the work of the farm hands. From a sandbox in the yard, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> plotted how he and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> would run their own dairy operation. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> tucked a toy tractor into <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>'s coffin, and the Saturday they buried his big brother, he begged to go home in time to turn on the TV wrestling shows `` so I can tell <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> about it.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> had wished for such a brother on the candles of a birthday cake; a pregnant <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> guessed it. `` I said, ` You wished for a baby brother,' and he started crying. He said if somebody knows your wish, it wo n't come true.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> and her children are crowded together on the couch, passing a rose and a carnation, two flowers saved from the funeral the day before. On the wall above hangs a portrait of <LOCATION> Elmbrook </LOCATION>, painted long ago by a relative. For an afternoon, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, 12-year-old <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> and 10-year-old <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> sit with <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> and tell warm, funny stories. ... Dad's <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation that turned out to be tours of farms ... ... How Grandpa would drive around lost, never asking directions, filling the car with cigar smoke until it seemed the journey would never end ... ... <PERSON> Danny </PERSON>'s favorite joke: Why did they outlaw round bales of hay? Because cows could n't get a square meal. `` What was your father's favorite song?'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> asks. They sing: `` Sugar in the morning, sugar in the evening, sugar at suppertime. Be my little sugar and love me all the time.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> laughs, pulling dark hair back from her face to show not tear-swollen misery but twinkling eyes. `` He sang that to me all of the time ... and he had a rotten singing voice.'' They laugh and laugh. Then <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> asks the question: `` Why, why did he have to go down?''

<HEAD>Survey: Executives Waste Many Hours on Unproductive Phone Calls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American executives spend too much time on unproductive or unnecessary phone calls, according to a survey of top corporate managers. Motivational Systems, a management-development consultant that preaches time management and efficiency, surveyed the phone habits of 200 top executives at the largest 1,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations. The results, according to company President <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Flax </PERSON>, show an undisciplined approach to the telephone that costs money and hurts productivity. <PERSON> Flax </PERSON> said the 200 executives responding to the survey were chief executive officers, chief financial officers and managing partners of major companies. They were questioned about the amount of time they spent on the phone, the results they achieved and the number of follow-up calls needed. Overall, the executives said they spend about 28 percent of their working days on the phone. Based on a nine-hour work day, <PERSON> Flax </PERSON> said, that means 13 hours a week _ or 14.5 weeks a year _ are spent on the phone. Flax estimates that about four of those weeks _ or hundreds of hours a year _ are wasted calling people back, reaching the wrong person or simply not being organized enough to get the job done with one call. <PERSON> Flax </PERSON> said he tells clients of his West Orange-based company that their servitude to the telephone is unneccesary. He said phone time can be cut dramatically by making phone calls in clusters rather than interrupting the day's routine, by never leaving vague messages because they invite the same and by having a secretary screen incoming calls. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said many executives are needlessly interrupted because their secretaries have not been taught which calls to let through and which can be better handled elsewhere. He suggests keeping track of a week's worth of incoming calls, then going over the calls and classifying them so the secretary sees the principles behind the decisions he or she has to make. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> uses four basic classifications: calls that need to be put through directly, those that should be referred elsewhere, those the secretary can handle and calls that need returning. Each group can be broken into efficient subgroups, he said. `` The key is basing the system on the real world experience of calls that actually came in one week,'' he said. Flax also suggests writing an informal agenda before important calls and learning the fine art of cutting the call short when the conversation gets sidetracked. `` Let the caller know that you have a meeting to attend, a letter to dictate or a project that needs your attention,'' he said. `` Some people need a gentle reminder that others may be pressed for time.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> agrees. `` When two people get on a telephone, they're really having a two-person meeting,'' he said. `` The person who receives the call usually does n't know it's coming and so having an agenda gives the other person a great advantage.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s graduate school of management, warns against going too far for the sake of efficiency. He said executives must keep in mind that business is essentially a network of personal relationships. `` The development of inter-personal skills and the ability to relate to people are both important components of a successful businessman,'' he said. `` We all seek efficiency, but we're making a mistake if we forsake social graces.'' But <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> agreed that an organized, well-balanced phone strategy produces superior results. At <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ where one would not expect to find a passion for shorter telephone calls _ a range of courses is available to counsel executives and other clients on telephone technique. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, the district manager for client education training at the company's divisional headquarters in <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION>, said time management goes hand in hand with good communications. `` If you manage your time efficiently as an executive, for instance, setting aside a time period to make most of your calls, you get more done,'' he said. He stopped short of recommending brevity, however.

<HEAD>SEC Charges Three in Levine Spinoff Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has accused two ex-stockbrokers and a lawyer of insider trading on information received indirectly from <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, the former investment banker who triggered the ongoing crackdown on Wall Street crime. In a lawsuit, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> charges the three men and an investment company formed by two of them with unlawful trading in 15 stocks from March 1984 through June 1985 as part of an international trading ring. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> seeks alleged illicit profits and penalties totaling in the millions of dollars in the suit filed Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The defendants allegedly received non-public information from <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Meier </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s account representative at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a Bahamian bank through which <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> ran his 1980-86 illegal trading operation. In some prior cases, people who received inside information second-hand have not been charged. But the lawsuit claims that the three men `` knew or should have known'' they were using non-public information about pending mergers or takeovers. The complaint is the first against parties who allegedly received information through <PERSON> Meier </PERSON>, who in 1986 settled charges with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and was barred for life from the securities industry. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a former Wall Street banker, pleaded guilty to violating securities laws and returned $ 11.6 million in illegal profits in June 1986. His admissions spawned dozens of civil and criminals charges in the continuing Wall Street insider trading investigation. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, 36, who made millions trading on inside information on the stocks of companies targeted for takeovers, was paroled from a federal prison last year. He has said he has formed a private consulting firm in mergers and acquisitions. The defendants are <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who worked at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> from 1982 to February 1985, and then at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> until June 1987; <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, 33, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> corporate lawyer now practicing in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Zubillaga </PERSON>, 39, a Venezuelan citizen who worked in <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> offices and resigned in April 1986. Also named is <ORGANIZATION> BCM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate investment vehicle formed by <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> in 1984. The complaint details five of the 15 deals, listing $ 452,175 in alleged illegal profits made by the defendants, friends and family members. Under federal securities laws, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also is demanding three times the total in penalties. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said unspecified profits were made in the 10 other deals but not listed in the lawsuit. According to the lawsuit, <PERSON> Meier </PERSON> placed many of <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s orders through accounts managed by <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>. It also states that <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> had separate stock dealings with <PERSON> Meier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> also traded securities using inside information through an account he shared with <PERSON> Zubillaga </PERSON>, the suit claims. The two had an agreement to split profits and losses on the trades, it says. The lawsuit also claims that <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> helped <PERSON> Meier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> try to deceive the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> after they learned of the government's investigation, providing reports purported to be stock analyses based on public information It also says <PERSON> Meier </PERSON> destroyed documents showing that he had provided money used by <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> in some real estate investments to further the alleged deception. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>'s lawyer, said his client would `` fully litigate the matters.'' An attorney for <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletiere </PERSON>, declined to comment. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said they would attempt to serve the suit on <PERSON> Zubillaga </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The 15 stocks listed as involved in the alleged illegal trading are: <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McGraw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Jewel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Esmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SFN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ARA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zellerbach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Multimedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Crude Prices Weaken, OPEC Production Rising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to rein in production could continue to weaken oil prices this week, analysts say. On Monday, the September contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grade of crude, tumbled to a five-month low, closing at $ 17.91 a barrel, 12 cents lower than Friday's settlement The near-term contract last closed lower on Feb. 23, when the price was $ 17.83. Volume was light as many investors were unwilling to make commitments. `` Buyers do n't want to buy this high and sellers do n't want to sell this low,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Simard </PERSON>, energy broker at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Gasoline futures traded on the exchange also fell, with the September contract finishing down 0.49 cent at 49.75 cents a gallon. Heating oil for September delivery lost 0.63 cent to finish at 48.55 cents a gallon. Crude prices have fallen more than $ 2.80 a barrel since July 5 as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries continued to pump more oil than the market could absorb. Various estimates put <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production at 21.3 million to 21.8 million barrels a day in July _ nearly 3 million barrels higher than this time last year and about 2 million barrels more than the 19.5 million-barrel ceiling set by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> when it met in June. `` One clear message seems to be that the system of proportional quota increases applied in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in June just does n't work,'' <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION>, an industry publication, said in a report released Monday. `` Revenue needs seem just as important as <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> rivalries in sparking increased production this summer,'' it said. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> estimates that world oil consumption this year will average 52.1 million barrels a day, 2.4 percent more than in 1988, but demand appears to be easing. Too much oil last year led to a price drop of more than $ 5 in WTI from $ 18.52 on April 18, 1988, to the year's low of $ 12.60 on Oct. 5. While analysts do n't expect anything that dramatic this year they see prices continuing to weaken before they recover. Some predict prices could fall to $ 17.50 a barrel before <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s next meeting, scheduled for Sept. 23 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, to discuss whether to raise or lower the production cap in the final three months of the year `` Eventually people feel <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will get it together and prices will get strong, but in the immediate situation, there's going to be a little bit of pain,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, vice president in charge of energy brokering for <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON> <PERSON> Spriggs </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, believes prices could fall even further to around $ 16.50 a barrel by the time <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meets `` I see this continuing,'' <PERSON> Spriggs </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s productive capacity is higher than people think and it's growing, particularly because of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said recently that a new export pipeline would add 1.5 million barrels a day to its current capacity by next year. The repair of oil terminals damaged in its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also is expected to expand its capacity. Weakness in the gasoline market also has pressured crude prices in recent weeks. Exaggerated estimates of strong demand and concern about supply problems due to the Exxon oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, refinery maintenance delays, accidents and production problems in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> led refiners to produce too much gasoline too quickly. As inventories piled up because of slow demand, prices have eroded. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refineries in recent days lowered the posted wellhead price for WTI by 25 cents to $ 17.25 a barrel.

<HEAD>UAL Board To Consider Davis Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> say they will give `` careful consideration'' to an unsolicited takeover offer from investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, which sent shares of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent company soaring 28 percent. The offer from <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who unsuccessfully bid to acquire the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, reportedly values <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> at $ 200 a share or $ 4.32 billion, although analysts say the price could rise if others make offers. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> shares jumped $ 46.25 to close at $ 210.75 a share Monday in heavy trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> described the offer Monday as `` highly conditional'' but declined to give further information. The <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board will consider it at a Wednesday meeting, officials said. `` While the board of directors has not decided whether a sale of the company is in the best interest of the company's shareholders and other constituencies, in keeping with its fiduciary duty, the board will give careful consideration to Mr. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' proposal,'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> chairman and president, said in a statement. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fingeroth </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor would not make any comment on his offer, which was disclosed Monday. United is the nation's second-largest airline after <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in terms of paid passenger miles. The carrier owns 80 percent of its 408-jet fleet, the highest percentage of ownership among the major carriers and a factor seen as enhancing its value to suitors. Its other planes are leased, a practice common with airlines. Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> announced orders for as many as 370 new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> aircraft valued at $ 15.74 billion. United also has a large route network in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, the world's fastest-growing air-travel region. And last month _ one day before the deadly crash of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 near <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> _ the carrier filed petitions with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> for several new European routes. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an airline analyst for the Philadelphia-based investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' bid is reasonable. `` What I expect is that it will trigger interest in the airline,'' he said. `` The key is who will be new bidders, which could include other airlines.'' In 1987, members of the union representing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots proposed an employee takeover of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> for $ 4.5 billion, which was rejected as inadequate. Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Damron </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the union has not seen <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' proposal, but that the union's financial and legal advisers would study it `` The pilots have a long-time interest in employee ownership in whatever form that would take,'' <PERSON> Damron </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a former oil wildcatter who once owned moviemaker 20th <ORGANIZATION> Century-Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, prompted a takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> when he announced March 28 he had offered to purchase the <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, Minn.-based parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for $ 90 a share. The <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board of directors rejected the offer, and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> appealed directly to shareholders with a tender offer. The board then put the airline on the market, eventually selling it to a group headed by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> for $ 3.65 billion, or $ 121 a share. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock rose sharply as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> bidding, going from $ 117.50 in mid-June to $ 190 in late July amid speculation that investors such as <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had purchased stakes in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. The stock settled in recent trading, closing Friday at $ 164.50. But it soared Monday as word spread about the <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> bid, opening at $ 196 and climbing to $ 210.75 at the close. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has indicated recently it would no longer look kindly on leveraged takeovers of major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, and <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said a high-debt bid for United could draw opposition. `` It would weaken the company to such an extent it would not be a viable carrier,'' he said. But, he said, `` If someone with ample new equity like <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> makes an offer, I do n't see that much room for <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> objection.'' In reaction to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' bid, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> put <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 215 million in BBB-rated industrial revenue bonds on review for possible downgrading Such a move would increase borrowing costs for the airline. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> reported a 14 percent increase in its second-quarter profit from a year earlier. For the quarter ended June 30, the airline reported net income of $ 141 million, or $ 6.52 per share, on revenue of $ 2.5 billion. The company had revenue of $ 8.98 billion in all of 1988.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has signed a technology-sharing agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Samsung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and intends to resell low-end workstations built by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> company. The move was seen as an effort by <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> to capture more of the burgeoning worldwide market for workstations, high-performance desktop computers priced from $ 5,000 to $ 100,000. By sharing technology on development of so-called reduced instruction set computer semiconductor chips, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> could gain a competitive edge over rival manufacturers who are trying to win acceptance for their own RISC-based chips. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> is expected to devote it own manufacturing resources to `` high-margin'' workstations and other products, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, a writer who follows the workstation market, expected to reach $ 20 billion annually by 1992. `` <ORGANIZATION> Samsung </ORGANIZATION> is a very credible low-cost alternative for HP,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> rarely has resold computers built for it by others, and the move indicates how serious HP is in fighting for a share of the workstation market, <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Long John Silver's Parent Will Sell to Investment Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A relatively low stock price and stable cash flow has prompted directors of the parent company of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION>'s Seafood Shoppes chain to agree to be acquired for $ 620 million. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, chairman of the Lexington-based <ORGANIZATION> Jerrico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the stock price, recently about $ 20 a share, and cash flow, $ 70 million a year, could attract unfriendly offers, a prime factor in the decision to sell. `` Once in play, you're gone,'' <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said. Rather than leave the company open for that possibility, <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said when he was approached with what seemed like a good offer from the <ORGANIZATION> DJS-Inverness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harlan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> investment groups a couple of months ago, he decided to explore it. <ORGANIZATION> Jerrico </ORGANIZATION>'s directors agreed to sell to the two New York-based investment groups for $ 24.25 in cash per share of common stock. <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weil </PERSON>, vice chairman, will retire when the transaction is completed. Other executives are to receive an ownership position in the company, which also operates <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s, Florenz and <PERSON> Fazoli </PERSON>'s restaurants. <ORGANIZATION> Jerrico </ORGANIZATION> got its start as the White Tavern Shoppes, a small chain of hamburger stands begun by <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Shelbyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, in 1929. It soon moved to <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> and in 1946 started a <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s restaurant In 1957, under <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, it began franchising the family-style restaurant. Its first Long <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>'s Seafood Shoppe opened in 1969. The company, the nation's largest seafood chain, now employs about 18,000 people nationwide. But a mature restaurant business has slowed the company's growth and price increases in fish in recent years cut profit below anticipated levels. That prompted a slowdown in construction plans, the layoff of about 60 employees earlier in the year and general belt tightening. Such factors also have prompted speculation in recent months that the company was a takeover candidate. In the past few months, though, <ORGANIZATION> Jerrico </ORGANIZATION>'s fish prices have declined, and cost cuts have improved its financial picture, said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON>. He and his fellow investors were attracted to <ORGANIZATION> Jerrico </ORGANIZATION> for those reasons and because they believe that people, as they become more health conscious, are eating more fish. <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON>'s company owns the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurants </ORGANIZATION>, a medium - to higher-priced chain based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and the high-priced <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>'s Restaurants of DJS-Inverness recently has acquired the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; A <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the <ORGANIZATION> Steak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ale and <PERSON> Bennigan </PERSON>'s chains. The acquisition is contingent on the investment groups receiving at least 51 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Jerrico </ORGANIZATION>'s stock under their offer.

 <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of athletic shoes and clothing, is branching out in a new direction with an agreement to buy boat maker <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 42 million. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> chief financial officer, said Monday, `` We have stated that we were looking to diversify and particularly to diversify out of footwear. Granted it's a long way from a boat to a shoe, but we never wanted to be tied to a shoe.'' <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION>'s ambition tied in with plans of <ORGANIZATION> CML </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> which announced last week that it would sell off its <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whaler </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sybervision </ORGANIZATION> divisions. <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> said that under the agreement, to be completed in 60 days, it will also receive warrants to buy 400,000 shares, or 6 percent, of <ORGANIZATION> CML </ORGANIZATION> stock for $ 31.25 per share in the next eight years. In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Monday, <ORGANIZATION> CML </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 26 a share, down $ 1. <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 14.37 -LCB- a share, down 25 cents. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whaler </LOCATION>, which will give <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> a foot in the recreational boating door, has about 500 employees at facilities in <LOCATION> Rockland </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Edgewater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. It reported sales of $ 66 million in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION>, a major force in sports and leisure wear, had sales last year of about $ 1.8 billion. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whaler </LOCATION> has an easily recognized name in the boating industry with its `` unsinkable'' hulls, constructed with a proprietary foam-core material. He said the boat company can do better than the 5 percent of the power boat market it has now. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> declined to say what <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> plans for the acquisition, except to say there are no plans for staff or management changes. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whalers </ORGANIZATION> range in length from nine to 31 feet and sell for $ 2,300 to $ 126,000. The company has had problems this year. It announced plans to close a leased production plant and layoffs of 170 employees.

 The stock market inched higher this morning toward new post-crash highs. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which surged Monday to within 30 points of its record close reached nearly two years ago, advanced 1.14 by 10 a.m. EDT to 2,696.13. Among broader market indicators, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composite </ORGANIZATION> index of all listed issues rose 0.02 to 194.21. On the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index rose 0.10 to 379.28. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5-to-4 on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, with 534 up, 421 down and 555 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 38.75 million shares after the first half hour of trading. The Monday rally was incited by takeover-related buying and waning anxiety over the possibility of recession. Many brokers said that combination compelled many investors to shift more money into stocks. Nonetheless, others question how long the rally will last. Much of the strength in the market lately has been derived from takeover speculation and computer-assisted buying strategies that are n't based on stocks as a long-term investment On Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average jumped 41.54 points to 2,694.99, which is 27.43 points shy of the record closing high of 2,722.42 reached on Aug. 25, 1987.

 <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, eldest son of <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> founder, <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, has resigned as president and chief executive officer in a move the company called painful but necessary in its recovery from major losses. The 11-member board of directors met at <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> headquarters Monday night in a special meeting, where the younger <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> resigned. The board then named as acting president and CEO, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> H.S </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chou </PERSON>, who is currently a vice chairman and director of the international computer maker. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, 38, will remain on the board and undertake special projects, his father said in a news release today. A search committee for a new president was also formed. The younger <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> could not be reached for comment today. But in a prepared statement, he said, `` I believe this action is in the best interest of <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> at this time. ... Employees and customers will be best served by a speedy resolution to the company's current situation.'' <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> called his son's resignation, `` in keeping with his constant devotion to doing what he felt was in the best interest of the company.'' Last week, the company announced a $ 375 million quarterly loss and suspended dividend payments. Its financial predicament put it in violation of a bank-lending agreement, the company noted. Most of the loss resulted from a $ 237 million pre-tax charge to cover the cost of a restructuring that involved closing factories, cutting jobs in its worldwide work force of 28,000 people, and lowering the book value of outdated assets. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> stock has lost more than 80 percent of its value since early 1984, when it traded at more than $ 35 a share. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> closed Monday at $ 5.75 per share, up 12 -LCB- cents. Founded in 1951, the company made its reputation in the 1970s in office word processors. But sales began to slip with the increasing popularity of personal computers. Its minicomputer business fell behind as well, eclipsed by workstations. In November 1986, the elder <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> stepped down as president and was replaced by his son, a computer mathematician who had been with the company since 1972. <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> on Monday returned to work parttime after recovering from surgery for cancer of the esophagus. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Henning </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> spokesman, said today of the action, `` We wanted to give a consistent message that we are doing everything and anything possible, even taking steps that are painful,'' he said. `` We have a lot of work to do.''

 The Las Vegas Review-Journal and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION>, journalistic rivals for 39 years, have announced plans to merge their business, circulation and production operations. The proposal is a move to save the Sun, which is losing about $ 3 million a year, has a debt of $ 10.7 million and has not been profitable since 1981, according to the proposal for a joint operating agreement. The Sun's founder and feisty editor, <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspun </PERSON>, who died July 22, for years sought a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> with the more powerful Review-Journal. An agreement was signed by the two papers July 12, and the plan was announced onday. If approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the plan will make <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> at least the 19th <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city to have a JOA. The agreement calls for both newspapers to maintain separate newsrooms and separate weekday editions. The <ORGANIZATION> Review-Journal </ORGANIZATION> would remain a morning paper and the Sun would become an afternoon publication, but combined morning editions, labeled the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Review-Journal-Sun </LOCATION>, would be published on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. `` Without this move we believe the Sun is in probable danger of financial failure,'' Sun President <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspun </PERSON> said in a statement. `` With this move, there will be no displacement of Sun newsroom personnel and there will be the continuation of an important newspaper.'' The Review-Journal is <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper and the flagship for <ORGANIZATION> Donrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 59 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> daily papers. The Sun is the state's third-largest paper. Like many papers in a city with a dominant competitor, the Sun has been losing circulation. It dropped 8 percent daily and 11 percent Sunday between 1980 and 1988, while the <ORGANIZATION> Review-Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s circulation increased 50 percent daily and 60 percent on Sunday The <ORGANIZATION> Review-Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s daily circulation at the end of 1988 was 121,321 compared with 50,515 for the Sun. Sunday circulation was 142,923 for the Review-Journal, 54,669 for the Sun. Under the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, the Sun would receive 10 percent of the operating profits of the two newspapers and the Review-Journal would receive 90 percent, based on its stronger financial position. The Sun will give <ORGANIZATION> Donrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> 10 percent of the outstanding stock in Community Cable TV worth an estimated $ 20 million and an option to purchase an additional 35 percent of the stock.

 Local pilots for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> voted by a 4-to-1 margin early today to continue their five-month-old strike, and a spokesman recommended a national airline walkout on Labor Day. About 500 striking pilots and their spouses met for an informational meeting late Monday with members of the national <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and voted 493-121 not to return to work. Pilots union leaders will take the results of the straw ballot to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later this week where they will be discussed by the group's 20-member master executive councl, which will plan future strike action. Pilots were voting in other cities around the country this week. `` There's no compromising,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a pilot with Eastern for 26 years. `` This has nothing to do about money. It's just plain old dignity. An <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said much of the sentiment in the closed meeting was to urge a national suspension of airline service near Labor Day weekend. `` It's easier to try to shut down the whole country than to continue alone,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a spokesman for pilots in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` It would create political chaos and get presidential intervention.'' He said such a suspension was just a tentative plan. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters, said the union's national leadership has not taken a position yet on whether it would support a national walkout. He said the possibility of a national walkout was among the topics that would be discussed in a meeting today between <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON> would not say where that meeting was to take place. Pilots walked out on Eastern in March in solidarity with the machinists union, which struck Eastern March 4. The airline a few days later filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Eastern has said that under its reorganization it will need only 1,700 pilots. It said that by the end of last week 380 pilots had crossed picket lines, 300 newly hired pilots had completed training and 700 more were in training. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> has 3,600 members employed for Eastern. From the outset, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management has said it does n't need the striking machinists union, whose 8,500 members include mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground services workers.

 Buyers of American cars may be getting happier with their purchases, but the Japanese-made Acura once again provides the most customer satisfaction, a new survey says. It was the third straight year that the luxury division of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> topped the survey by <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. Power and Associates. More than 24,000 owners of 1988 model cars were surveyed after owning their vehicles for a year. Buyers of other <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> models and cars made by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> followed Acura in satisfaction The top-ranked U.S.-produced nameplate was <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> division, in fifth place. Owners of U.S.-made automobiles gave higher marks to their cars and dealers this year than they had in the past, surpassing European makes for the first time since the survey began in 1986 and closing the gap between domestics and Asian imports. Overall customer satisfaction increased this year as it had during the three previous years, the survey said. The survey covered owners of 35 different nameplates. It measured satisfaction in 23 areas, including courtesy and interest of dealership personnel, convenience of service appointment times and specific questions about vehicle performance. The survey was outlined in a news release from J.D. Power headquarters in <LOCATION> Agoura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The full survey is published in the August issue of the organization's newsletter. Acura, <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> were ranked Nos. 1-3 in this year's and last year's surveys. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON> swapped places this year from last year's survey. The next five, in order of customer satisfaction, were <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON>, a tie between <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> and BMW, and <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION>, the survey said. According to the survey's point system, there was a smaller gap between the top-ranked cars and the bottom-ranked ones, indicating an increasing level of customer satisfaction among owners of all of the cars surveyed.

 Callers dialing for operators reached recordings in 15 states and the nation's capital as some 157,000 workers from three regional telephone companies settled in for what many expect will be a long strike. The companies urged people to dial direct when possible, because such calls are handled by computer. No major delays were reported Monday for those calling without operator assistance. `` We do have minor delays in directory assistance,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Chez </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, part of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>. `` People are having to wait a little longer.

About 157,000 union workers were on strike Monday, forcing managers at the three companies to work long hours and learn the strikers' tasks The strikes by the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> began over the weekend over salary, companies' attempts to shift health care costs to workers and local issues. Negotiators scheduled talks between one union and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> today, but no formal talks were set elsewhere. Informal discussions were being held, however. `` It seems like the sides are so far apart now, it could last three weeks,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonelli </PERSON>, a striking nine-year veteran of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>. Arrests were reported in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where 14 people were charged with disorderly conduct for blocking a <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> building, police said. <ORGANIZATION> Chesapeake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> brought a court complaint against a union leader in <LOCATION> Clarksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, because pickets kept a supervisor and vehicles from entering and leaving the office The union called it a misunderstanding. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, whose employees are not on strike, filed a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> before pickets withdrew from a door reserved for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T workers in a building shared with <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, R.I.

A <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, said a flammable liquid was poured into locked phone line distribution boxes and set afire, temporarily knocking out service to 1,900 customers. At <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> offices, 10,000 managers took the places of about 60,000 strikers. `` Things are going as expected. There are delays in directory assistance and other operator types of services, such as people needing help making collect or third-party calls,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonomo </PERSON>. He said managers are working long hours, but `` it's a morale-boosting kind of thing'' because people are `` working together in a crisis.'' The striking workers, however, yelled `` Scab!'' at those going into the midtown headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. The workers also urged passers-by not to pay their telephone bills. <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> has a national strike defense fund containing $ 17 million to $ 18 million, and will pay strikers based on need after the second week, <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> does not have a strike fund, and several workers Monday said they were committed to the strike but worried about making ends meet. `` The mortgage has got to be paid, and the state is n't in such great shape to go look for other jobs,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> at a picket line at a <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> special service center in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, with 60,000 strikers, serves most of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state; <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>'s 52,500 striking workers were in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>, with 44,500 workers off the job, serves northern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

They are <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> West and <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>. A seventh phone company, Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, reached a tentative agreement with unions representing 60,000 workers over the weekend.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar finished lower in quiet European trading Tuesday. Gold prices were little changed. Currency dealers said the market's exaggerated reaction to Friday's better-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment data left the dollar ripe for profit-taking. However, many traders said they were prepared to move to the sidelines until Friday when the July <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer price index and July retail sales data are released, shedding more light on the state of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> economy and inflation level. `` There was a lot of speculation that people in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> were selling a lot of dollars earlier,'' said <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Totzauer </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapfel </PERSON>, chief trader at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, said the dollar remained stuck in a range between 1.8800 marks and 1.9200 marks and that he does n't expect it to break out soon. `` I think the dollar wants to go down, but I'm really just not sure any more,'' <PERSON> Zapfel </PERSON> said. `` There's just not a lot of desire or ideas in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> right now.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell nearly 2 cents against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6250 to buy one pound, compared with $ 1.6075 late Monday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.53 yen to a closing 139.25 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was down to 138.75 yen. Other dollar rates at mid morning compared with late Monday: 1.8900 West German marks, down from 1.9055; 1.6270 Swiss francs, down from 1.6380; 6.3995 French francs, down from 6.4470; 2.1398 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1502; 1,362.50 Italian lire, down from 1,373.50; and 1.1720 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1745.

In his suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said one of his bosses told him in May that <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> had withdrawn the application for security clearance.

GE spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> declined comment but said that the security clearance `` is not a problem because this job does not require the level of security clearance that was needed for the job before.'' In the suit, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said the defendants violated government procedures by never giving him an acceptance or denial of his clearance application or holding a hearing where he could confront witnesses or examine the evidence against him. The suit, which does not ask for monetary damages, asks that his application be processed without discrimination.

The Dow Jones industrial average climbed above the 2,700 mark before an afternoon selloff analysts termed a normal and measured reaction to Monday's rally.

 Grain futures prices were moderately lower, but soybeans suffered double-digit losses Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. A wave of selling by several large brokerage houses near the close forced the November soybean contract to yet another low.

 The dollar drifted lower Tuesday against all major foreign currencies in listless summer trading. Gold prices firmed. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery rose to $ 366.20 a troy ounce from $ 365.90 late Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said the late bid for gold was $ 365.70, up 50 cents. Currency dealers said profit-taking following a moderate advance on Monday helped push the dollar lower, but trading was light in the absence of any market-moving news and because many traders were on vacation. `` There's really nothing happening. We're sort of in no-man's land,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a senior trader with <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market is just moving on whatever customer orders come in. The dollar moved sharply higher on Friday and continued to advance at the start of this week on speculation that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates are n't likely to decline soon. That sentiment followed the release of better-than-expected employment figures for July, which showed nonfarm payrolls risng by 169,000 and the jobless rate falling to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent in June. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.53 yen to a closing 139.25 yen.

<HEAD>Commodore Loses $8.9 Million In Fourth Fiscal Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Commodore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 8.9 million in its fourth fiscal quarter, blaming a strong dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and high interest rates in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> for a 16 percent drop in sales, the computer maker announced Tuesday. Commodore for months had been warning investors it would lose money in the quarter that ended June 30. Its stock rose 50 cents a share to $ 10.50 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. A strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar has cut into sales and decreased earnings when exchanging foreign currency for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, the company said. The company plans to compensate for the strong dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by keeping price reductions to a minimum and warily increasing prices on selected products in selected areas, Commodore treasurer <PERSON> Carden </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> said. High interest rates in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, another important market for Commodore, hurt consumer spending there, <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> said. The loss came on sales of $ 180.3 million. For the same period last year, the company earned $ 12.2 million, or 38 cents per share, on sales of $ 215.2 million. For the fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Commodore </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings dropped 8 percent to $ 51.3 million, or $ 1.59 per share, on sales of $ 939.7 million. In the last fiscal year, the company earned $ 55.8 million, or $ 1.75 per share, on sales of $ 871.1 million. The company received a $ 1.2 million tax benefit in 1989 by carrying forward losses from previous years. In 1988 the tax carry forward was worth $ 7.6 million.

 Stock prices climbed again Tuesday to another post-crash high as the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average finished just under the 2,700 mark in active trading. The widely watched Dow average of 30 industrials rose 4.18 points to 2,699.17, just 23.25 points short of the record closing high of 2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987. The slight increase followed a 41-point surge Monday. After rising well above 2,700, the Dow average retreated broadly in an afternoon selloff analysts termed a normal and measured reaction to the runup a day earlier. The market regained some ground in the last 30 minutes of trading. `` I think it was healthy we held yesterday's gains without a backoff, particularly when you're near a psychological level,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoski </PERSON>, a technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hopwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` There's been no panic selling even though we've been near this level,'' he said. The Dow average's flirtation with the 2,700 level has resurrected fears from two years ago, when the market's historic highs reached in August were shattered two months later in the worst crash in history. The Black Monday panic of Oct. 19, 1987 has made many investors cautious. `` The ability of the market to probe into the 2,700 level and sustain itself has encouraged more and more people to become bullish,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, chief technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a low-profile metal manufacturer, announced Tuesday it has acquired a 6.6 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and may someday attempt to take control of the mid-sized airline. Midway `` has no interest in being acquired'' and has not had discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON>, the airline chairman and chief executive. Midway is a 10-year-old airline that ranks 16th in size in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with 0.8 percent of the nation's air traffic. Its hub at <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> appeals to business travelers because it is closer to downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiaries _ which include <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ make and sell engineered products such as fans and pumps. The company is a mystery to some airline analysts. `` They are n't a big player. I've never heard of them,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> said it had acquired 662,000 shares of Midway common stock through a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> III </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In a statement issued in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> holds 6.6 percent of its outstanding stock. <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> said it bought the Midway shares `` for investment and to acquire a significant equity interest'' in the Chicago-based airline. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> disclosure document also said <ORGANIZATION> Ampco </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiaries `` may also consider seeking to acquire control'' of Midway `` in the future, although they have no plans or proposals to do so at present.'' Midway was founded 10 years ago at the start of airline deregulation, when it served three <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> cities from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. The airline now serves 51 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, she said. Midway recently announced it had ordered for 74 new jets from <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> worth about $ 2 billion. According to the filing, <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> III </ORGANIZATION> bought the Midway shares at prices ranging from $ 14.75 to $ 18 between July 25 and last Thursday for a total of $ 10.3 million. Last week, Midway announced it had reached an agreement with Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to purchase routes, gates and aircraft from the strike-plagued carrier for $ 210 million. The proposed sale covers gates at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and Eastern routes from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. It also includes operating slots at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, 16 DC-9 jetliners and spare engine and parts. The Canadian routes would represent Midway's first international flights, Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. The agreement must be approved by a federal bankruptcy court judge as part of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s strike-recovery plan to restructure into a smaller airline.

 Oil futures prices rose Tuesday in light trading, pushed up by buyers hoping for a drop in oil inventories. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly statistics on oil stocks were due out after the close of trading. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude for delivery in Septemer rose 21 cents to close at $ 18.12. WTI, the benchmark grade of light <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, fell 12 cents on Monday in another quiet session. Contracts for delivery later in the year also showed gains but closed below $ 18 a barrel. Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline for September rose 0.69 cent to finish at 50.44 a gallon, while September heating oil gained 0.12 cent to a settlement price of 48.56 cents a gallon. Except for a few upward blips, crude prices have been falling since late July. The September contract has lost 42 cents since July 25, when it traded at $ 18.54. Analysts said the latest gains came on expectations that last week's hurricane in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would reduce some of the inventories that have been building lately. Sluggish demand and excess production by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> have increased the supplies of crude and gasoline in storage. `` People were buying ahead of the APIs,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, energy broker for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. `` Because of the hurricane last week people think there will be a drawdown in inventories.'' The storm forced the shutdown of some refineries, delaying the production of gasoline and other refined products. Despite the advance, some traders said the underlying weakness in the market remains and prices could fall further. `` We expect prices to continue on a downtrend,'' said <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothenberg </PERSON>, trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It might not be tomorrow or the next day but we expect the market to go down before it comes out of this doldrum.''

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Prices Rise Sharply; Soybeans Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Cotton futures prices made an abrupt about-face Tuesday, surging to the upper reaches of the daily trading limit after falling nearly their daily limit in the previous session. On other markets, soybeans suffered big losses after a wave of selling near the close, and crude oil futures broke back above the $ 18-a-barrel plateau. The sharp price swings in cotton appeared to reflect uncertainty over the size and quality of the crop in advance of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> crop production report due out Thursday. `` It seems the market at some point -LRB- Wednesday -RRB- discovered the rains Tuesday in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> were n't as beneficial as originally thought,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Traders speculated that extremely dry conditions in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> may have lowered the yield there, while unusually wet weather throughout the growing areas of the Delta during the spring and summer is believed to have adversely affected much of the crop there. Many fields in both regions apparently have been so devastated that growers with marginal crops are considering abandoning the acreage or trying to plant another crop. Cotton settled 1.86 cents to the limit-up 2 cents higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with the contract for delivery in October at 74.80 cents a pound. Grain futures prices eased slightly, but soybean prices absorbed a more direct hit on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was n't any rhyme or reason to it,'' said <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The market was on the defensive all day, but there was n't any fresh news at the close.''

 A year in corporate limbo ended for <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> with the announcement Tuesday that the subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is no longer for sale. The Norwalk-based manufacturer of radar systems and other electronic military equipment was put up for sale in April 1988, but <ORGANIZATION> UTC </ORGANIZATION> decided to keep it after receiving offers it said were inadequate. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>'s 3,460 employees learned of the decision Monday in a letter from division President <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>. The letter was made public Tuesday. `` It was n't a grudging kind of decision. It really was n't. I'm pleased to be able to say that, because if it was I'd really be feeling bad and I'm not,'' <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, who participated in the decision, said during an interview at his office `` They would be delighted to have us return to profitability, and that's what we're going to do,'' <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said, predicting <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> would begin to improve its bottom line after 1990. Security analyst <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunyaner </PERSON>, vice president of research with <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> was pulled off the auction block because `` the market is glutted with defense-related businesses.'' `` It's not as an attractive property as it was a year ago,'' he said. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> has been part of Hartford-based <ORGANIZATION> UTC </ORGANIZATION> since 1958. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> UTC </ORGANIZATION> came close to selling the company on more than one occasion. But he said no offers were made that came close to what <ORGANIZATION> UTC </ORGANIZATION> executives and <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> thought was a fair price for the $ 400 million-a-year company. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> declined to name the suitors. `` There was a lot of good interest by a couple of substantial companies that were intrigued with our technological capabilities,'' he said. Since 1988, <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> has eliminated nearly 700 jobs, including 400 that were announced in late May when a restructuring plan was revealed. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said more jobs might be cut after this year. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> has been posting losses since 1986. Those losses resulted in part from cost overruns and demands for additional investments in four new radar systems that were being developed simultaneously by <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> for the military. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said the company spent `` hundreds of millions of dollars'' in development costs over the past four years. In April <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> was eliminated in April as a subcontractor to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Advanced Tactical Aircraft, or A-12. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> had spent $ 114 million to design and develop the radar system for the A-12. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> has filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> Stamford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeking unspecified damages from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>. General Dynamics, which canceled the contract because it was reportedly dissatisfied with <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>'s performance, has sought to have the suit dismissed because of the top-secret nature of the project. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> declined comment on the lawsuit, but said work on the two remaining radar systems is progressing. He said <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> is in the flight-test stage for both radar systems, the final step before they are put in operation. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>, founded 60 years ago by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>, developed the <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> bombsite used in American bombers at the end of World War II. Since that time, virtually all of <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>'s business has been for the military. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said the company has no plans to expand into non-defense-related areas and soon will announce details of two contracts signed in the past two weeks. He revealed that the contracts are worth a total of $ 60 million. <ORGANIZATION> UTC </ORGANIZATION>'s other divisions include Sikorsky helicopters, <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> aircraft, <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> elevators, and Carrier air conditioners.

<HEAD>Chinese Still Potential Customers for U.S. Grain; Timetable Unclear</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still could be a big customer for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain but recent internal turmoil could delay progress developing that market, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Wuu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hao </PERSON>, director of the council's operation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said the country is short on cash to buy feed grain. But, with more than a billion people to feed, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> needs to have more grain _ both for feeding to livestock for meat production and for making consumer products from corn flakes to beer. `` They have to improve the diets,'' said <PERSON> Hao </PERSON>. `` Without happy citizens, nothing will work.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Feed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> will continue to focus on improving livestock feed production in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and on teaching the Chinese modern livestock production techniques, he said. The poultry industry holds the greatest potential for growth in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because it offers faster profits and, as a relatively new industry, faces fewer government restrictions, he said. But pork remains the main meat in the Chinese diet. <PERSON> Hao </PERSON> said 80 percent of the total meat consumption is pork, but production techniques are very primitive _ usually a couple of pigs in the yard eating crop waste. Only 10 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 300 million hogs are fed a modern, blended feed ration, <PERSON> Hao </PERSON> said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> representatives are working with the Chinese to change that. In addition, the Chinese have started buying better swine breeding stock. Eventually, <PERSON> Hao </PERSON> said that will mean a demand for more feed grain. But the Chinese currently can afford to import only `` wheat flour to fill stomachs'' of the people, he said. `` The market right now is not very much because they just do n't have the foreign exchange,'' said <PERSON> Hao </PERSON> `` It's still too early to assess'' the impact of this summer's violence on trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said <PERSON> Hao </PERSON> said he and the four people on his staff left <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the fighting because they did not know what to expect, but have since returned to resume work in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Among their projects are sending 4,000 technical brochures on livestock feeding quarterly to government officials, schools and others who could spread the information; working with Chinese producers on feed quality control to make sure animals are getting the nutrition they need; and teaching feed management to producers. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization of farm and agribusiness groups, was formed in 1960 to promote export markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, barley and sorghum.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said Tuesday that organized labor is at odds with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on a number of issues. But <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, speaking at a news conference during the summer meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> Executive Council, the union federation's governing board, said he did n't want to pass judgment on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after just seven months in office He said the labor movement's disagreements with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are on issues such as the minimum wage, child care and the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike. `` That's not a very good beginning of a presidential term from my point of view,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. He said the federation supports the formation of a federal emergency board that would resolve the dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, its pilots, flight attendants and <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said the executive council will meet with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> about organized labor's efforts on behalf of striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> also said the labor movement remains viable despite the defeat two weeks ago of efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union to organize workers at a Japanese auto plant in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said the organizing efforts at the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, have been deferred, not defeated. `` We have a long history of many years of efforts to organize some of the firms we have succeeded in organizing in this country, including the automobile industry, where our initial efforts were defeated time and again,'' he said. `` But we persevered. We're not defeated as long as we stay in the game.'' In what was expected to be a close vote, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> workers on July 26 and 27 voted by more than 2-1 against unionizing the plant. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> also said the federation is engaged in an experimental effort to attract new members at plants that have yet to be organized. He said the effort involves giving workers at plants targeted for organization associate membership, with full membership granted once a collective bargaining agreement is reached with the employer. The executive council passed resolutions Tuesday opposing reductions in the capital gains tax, advocating the strengthening of the Clean Air Act and criticizing recent <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings on affirmative action.

 <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>, often perceived as a `` white squire'' riding to the aid of besieged companies, has turned his sights on <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> has agreed to buy 12 percent to 14 percent of the airline holding company's stock through a new issue valued at $ 358 million, a move that could block a hostile takeover <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> stock closed Monday at $ 53 a share, up $ 1, on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The announcement of Buffet's move Monday came after the market's close. On Tuesday, the stock hit a high of $ 53 but then slipped to end at $ 51.12 -LCB-. The news of <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>'s purchase was both preceded and followed by more takeover frenzy in the airline industry. Earlier Monday, an unsolicited offer for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> sent shares of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent soaring. On Tuesday, a Pittsburgh-based manufacturing company said it has acquired a 6.6 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and indicated it might seek to take over the carrier. The billionaire <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>, known as the `` Oracle of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>'' for his canny investments and forthright business advice, has a reputation for taking sizable stakes in a limited number of companies and holding them, sometimes for years. <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>, who made a fortune buying little-known stocks, also owns bi He owns the <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. He played the role of friendly squire to razor maker <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, the object of two hostile takeover bids in three years. Under the <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> deal, Buffet would agree not to sell the stock to a bidder for 10 years without the approval of the airline's board of directors, except under limited conditions <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, which has its headquarters in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. That state's laws make it difficult to acquire a company without obtaining 85 percent of its shares. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> stock has risen steadily in the past three weeks as takeover speculation has swept the airline industry. Last month, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> money manager <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON> sent the stock soaring when he told federal regulators he might try to take over the airline. In a press release, <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> said it was unusual for him to invest in a capital - and labor-intensive industry The <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> stock purchase, he said, showed his `` high regard for -LRB- Chairman -RRB- <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Colodny </PERSON>'s management.'' <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> is buying preferred shares that will yield a 9.25 percent annual dividend and can be converted to common shares at $ 60 a share.

At that time, <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> owed more than $ 164 million to bondholders and to its bank lenders. It has paid more than $ 26 million in principal and interest payments on that debt. `` We came to the conclusion that the company simply could not afford to continue to make payments on that amount of debt,'' said <PERSON> Fantle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> operates 69 retail drug stores in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area, of which <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION> is a suburb, and five Total-Plus discount stores in the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, area. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> has more than 2,000 employees. In the quarter ended April 29, it lost $ 7.3 million on revenue of $ 39.2 million against a loss of $ 9.6 million on revenue of $ 54.1 million in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. In the nine months ended April 29, the company lost $ 16.6 million on sales of $ 128.8 million compared with a loss of $ 13.3 million on sales of $ 174.9 million in the corresponding year-earlier period. <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1954 by <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON>, who sold the company to a management group in 1984 before going on to make a series of unsuccessful corporate takeover attempts under the mantle of his <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is unrelated to the drugstore chain. <PERSON> Fantle </PERSON> attempted to revamp the company by remodeling stores, placing new emphasis on customer service, restructuring the company's finances and starting an unusual plan to donate 5 percent of the company's gross receipts to charity.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar opened lower against the Japanese yen Wednesday morning, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> edged up. The dollar opened at 138.72 yen, down 0.53 yen from Tuesday's close of 139.25 yen In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it ended at 138.88 yen overnight. Traders said the dollar's lower opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, following its losses in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was mainly due to concern over the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s monetary policy, which investors think might move further toward relaxation. <PERSON> Toru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON>, a foreign exchange analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the dollar is in a downward trend. Market players were also reluctant to increase their dollar positions ahead of the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wholesale price index for July, scheduled for Friday. `` To see whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is really slowing down or not, market players are very much concerned about the figure as an important indicator,'' <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON> said. `` The dollar edged up following last Friday's jobless rate report, but the rate is going back to where it was before,'' he said. Early last week, the dollar was trading in a range around 136 yen. But following the release of a lower-than-expected July <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figure of 5.2 percent, indicating continuing strength in the economy, the dollar moved up. He said trading Wednesday was light in the absence of market-affecting incentives. On the stock exchange, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues gained 63.23 points to move to 34,822.71 within the first 15 minutes of trading.

The Dow Jones index rose by 4.18 points. Participants were mainly buying chemical, paper and finance issues.

 <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that non-recurring charges cut into the food giant's quarterly profit. For the quarter ended June 30, Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> reported a profit of $ 87.2 million, or 71 cents a share, compared with earnings of $ 159.1 million, or $ 1.18 a share, in the same quarter of 1988. Quaker reported revenues of $ 1.56 billion for the period, which is the fourth quarter in the company's fiscal year, compared with revenues of $ 1.49 billion for the same period in fiscal 1988. For the fiscal year ended June 30, <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> reported a profit of $ 328.7 million, or $ 2.56 a share, compared with a profit of $ 413.6 million, or $ 3.20 a share, in its fiscal 1988. Revenue for the 12 months totaled $ 5.72 billion, compared with $ 5.33 billion in fiscal 1988. The fiscal 1989 results were offest by charges of $ 124 million due to plant consolidations and overhead reduction, officials said. In addition, a charge of about $ 26 million was taken for a change in accounting proceedures. `` Excluding the various restructuring charges associated with our steps to keep <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> a low-cost producer of premier brands, our overall performance was again at a record level,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithburg </PERSON>, chairman and chief operating officer.

 A call by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots union leaders to continue the 5-month-old strike has been swiftly backed by rank-and-file members and should be reinforced in caucuses held around the nation this week, union officials said Monday. Straw polls or voice votes in more than a dozen cities are expected to underscore the pro-strike sentiments of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> members, said <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. `` I think the union leaders were surprised at the resolve of the membership to continue the strike,'' said <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. `` It's plain we do not want to go back.'' About 500 Eastern pilots met in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Monday night and gave the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> leadership a standing ovation when asked how they felt about continuing the strike, union spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON> said. The pilots were to vote later on continuing the strike. The meeting was closed to reporters. E.J. <PERSON> Breen </PERSON>, national strike chairman, said <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> appears to be a stronghold for the strike, `` as we'll see in the balloting.'' But <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, spokesman for a group called <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said that pressure `` is building exponentially to cease the strike'' because of the assessments of union pilots at other airlines to pay strike benefits to the Eastern pilots. Votes on continuing the strike also are scheduled for Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, headquarters of the carrier. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> members in other cities such as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> also have indicated strong support for the walkout. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> warned consumers who had purchased Eastern tickets before the strike they must file claims with the bankruptcy court by Aug. 31 to be eligible for refunds with interest. The same deadline applies to people with unresolved cargo or baggage claims for flights scheduled before <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s March 9 bankruptcy filing. Consumers must file proof-of-claim forms with the court, even if they have already sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> or filled out a baggage claim, the department said. The forms can be obtained at any federal courthouse or by calling Eastern at 1-800-628-0010. Many of the 3,600 Eastern <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> members were linked by a nationwide conference call Sunday while the main meeting was held in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. On Saturday, the union's 20-member Master Executive Council, meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, voted to continue the strike. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said members in all cities except <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, opposed returning to work. In <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, members voted 40-22 in favor of ending the strike. `` By a large margin, the guys are saying, ` Do n't give a damned inch,''' said <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a pilots union spokesman in <LOCATION> Herndon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` They're pumped up.'' In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Sunday, some pilots booed and stormed out of a closed-door meeting after a return-to-work option was presented by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots union. One pilot pushed a television cameraman who was outside the meeting room. Some pilots circulated petitions suggesting that <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s national leadership was not giving full support to striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots and advocated a nationwide pilot work stoppage on Labor Day. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said a few pilots called Sunday to indicate they wanted to return to work. `` The reason we walked out has not changed. There's every indication that Eastern will be liquidated and merged into <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Airlines -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. `` If I wanted a job at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> I would have applied months ago.'' Eastern pilots and flight attendants walked off the job March 4 in sympathy with striking Machinists. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> leaders still back an effort by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> to purchase Eastern from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which also is the parent of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern, which has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization since March 9, has filed a plan to come out of bankruptcy by year's end with an airline nearly two-thirds smaller than its pre-strike levels. Eastern says it will need 1,700 pilots. The airline says about 380 <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> pilots have crossed the picket line, more than 300 newly hired pilots have completed training and 700 more are in training.
