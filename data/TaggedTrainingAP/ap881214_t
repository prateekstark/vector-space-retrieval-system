 Israelis from both major parties reacted coldly and sometimes angrily Thursday to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to open talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and one official said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was given no advance notice of the move. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> as lamenting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move. He said <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has not changed his position despite his more moderate language of recent weeks, the radio reported. `` They are cheap words and nothing more,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> was quoted as saying. Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON>, a senior member of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had made a `` small step forward'' in his recent statements but fell short of renouncing terror and recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had demanded. He said he doubted a planned U.S.-PLO meeting in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> would lead to substantive agreement because of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s declaration of a Palestinian state. `` If there is a meeting, not much will happen because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is familiar enough with the problem to know that a Palestinian state is not a solution,'' he said. <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> headed by <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, said the Ministry was studying the situation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who announced the decision Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he had discussed it beforehand with representatives of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But one Israeli official said on condition of anonymity that neither <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> nor other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had consulted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in advance. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has shunned any contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> regardless of its statements on recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, abandoning terrorism, and accepting <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The resolutions call for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from occupied lands and guarantee the rights of all states in the region to have secure borders. Israeli officials have contended <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> did not fully renounce terrorism because he praised the yearlong Palestinian uprising, in which Arabs have engaged in violent riots and attacked Israelis with firebombs and other makeshift weapons. Politicians from both <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday they believed the PO had not fulfilled all the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for a dialogue. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> supporters were clearly angered by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> parliament member and son of former prime minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was known to Israelis as `` a bunch of killers,'' and their aim of destroying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has not changed. `` From our point of view, a snake wearing a jacket and tie is nothing but a well-dressed snake,'' he said. `` We shall not negotiate with these people because no one is expected to choose the method of his own execution.'' <PERSON> Binyamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador and close associate of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said the decision was a `` terrible mistake.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has breached its policy -LRB- of not talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and the credibility of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been compromised,'' said <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc parliament member. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government has been either duped or they are deceiving themselves. The American government will regret what they have done once they realize who they are dealing with,'' he said in a telephone interview. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision was welcomed, however, by a leading member of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which was allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the Nov. 1 parliament elections. `` It's a great victory for American policy,'' said <PERSON> Ran </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a parliament member of the small party. `` With this new success, we are at the beginning of the peace process.'' Wednesday's announcement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> could upset sensitive negotiations under way between Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> over the formation of a new coalition government. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> have been bitterly divided on the peace issue, and their reactions to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> speech in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Tuesday showed they were also divided on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> earlier issued an uncompromising rejection of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s peace bid, labeling the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> speech as double-talk. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, however, complimented <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> for the peace bid by saying: `` He has learned to say peace, and I welcome this. He is learning.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also called for a peace dialogue with Palestinians `` immediately and without the Jordanians, if they so decide, as long as they do n't shoot.'' The Labor leader said, however, that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> should do more to end terrorism.

 A pioneering private effort to help underprivileged students get college scholarships has achieved a graduation rate sharply above the national average, a study concluded. The 21-year-old, privately financed <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> released a study of its first two decades Wednesday showing 80 percent of those who got grants from the program and enrolled in four-year colleges graduated. Nationally, about 50 percent of students who start college receive their degrees, the program said. <ORGANIZATION> CSP </ORGANIZATION> has assisted more than 57,000 students, most from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> public high schools, since its founding. Last year 3,700 students received specialized help applying for college admission and scholarships, and 540 underprivileged students received grants averaging $ 375. Under the program, counseling is available to all students but only students from underprivileged economic backgrounds can qualify for its direct grants. `` They really helped me a lot,'' said <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>, 34, who graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Bowling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 and is now a sales executive with a concrete supply company. <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>, the first member of his family to attend college, said <ORGANIZATION> CSP </ORGANIZATION> provided him with crucial help meeting an array of unfamiliar college admission and scholarship requirements and deadlines. `` As far as filling out paperwork, it was totally new for me,'' <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milano </PERSON>, the program's executive director, said the result of the survey showed that `` a private partnership can have a major impact on assisting economically disadvantaged students. ... They can go on to college and be very successful.'' <ORGANIZATION> CSP </ORGANIZATION> has 21 part-time counselers who visit high schools and meet with students to help them apply to college and seek financial assistance from various sources. Follow-up counseling continues through the campus years. The alumni study was conducted by <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Uyeki </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> among a random sample of 633 students out of the 8,205 who received direct <ORGANIZATION> CSP </ORGANIZATION> grants from 1967 to 1983. Eighty-five percent of those surveyed had average family incomes of less than $ 25,000 and more than half were the first family member to attend college. <ORGANIZATION> CSP </ORGANIZATION> calls itself the nation's oldest non-profit, privately supported college financial aid counseling service. It has been used as a model for similar programs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and other cities.

 The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest company, resigned Wednesday under fire for alleged involvement in a major business and political scandal. The minister of posts and telecommunications, <PERSON> Masaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON>, told a news conference he accepted the resignation of the company's chairman, <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> said Shinto denied any personal involvement in unethical stock trading but accepted responsibility for actions by his personal secretary. Japanese press reports said prosecutors traced about $ 81,000 to Shinto's bank account from proceeds of the sale of shares in <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a real-estate subsidiary of the Recruit conglomerate. Shinto on Tuesday issued a statement denying involvement in the share transaction and said it was carried out by his personal secretary, <PERSON> Kozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murata </PERSON>, in 1986. <PERSON> Murata </PERSON> has since resigned as Shinto's aide. The so-called Recruit scandal last week brought the resignation of <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> as finance minister and deputy prime minister. It has rocked <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s business and political worlds with allegations that government figures bought Recruit stock at low prices and made huge profits when the company went public. The Recruit company allegedly sought favors by distributing shares in Recruit-Cosmos with a guarantee of easy, tax-free profits. <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> and Telephone, ranked as the largest corporation in the world in terms of stock market capitalization, had business links with Recruit, which bought two U.S.-made supercomputers from the company and leased data communications circuits from it. As a former telecommunications monopoly, the company has been partially privatized, but Shinto and all other officials of the utility remain under regulations that it illegal for them to receive cash or shares from private firms that it does business with. Shinto has been the chief executive of the telecommunications giant since 1981 when it was still a government-owned monopoly. He oversaw the privatization, which started in 1985, and then took the title of president. He held that post until June this year, when he became chairman and chief executive, and the title of president went to <PERSON> Haruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>. Shinto's resignation would make him the most prominent victim in the business world of the Recruit scandal. It has also brought the resignation of news media executives and has broken several political careers in addition to that of <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, who a year ago was a major contender to be prime minister. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is on a list of prominent politicians whose aides profited from owning <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares, but he and the others denied any knowledge or involvement in the transactions. Among the others are former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, secretary-general of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The roots of the scandal go back to 1986, when unlisted <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares were offered to the prominent figures or their aides, often to be paid for with loans from a Recruit-linked finance company. The shares were listed for sale over the counter in October 1986 and immediately skyrocketed in value, yielding tax-free profits when they were sold.

 Before he was fitted with his new automated arms, 12-year-old <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> pulled on his shoes and socks with his teeth and wrote with his foot. Now, his new battery-powered arms are helping him learn to do everyday tasks in a more conventional way. `` It's easy. Nothing to it,'' said <PERSON> Armando </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruces </LOCATION>, about 180 miles south of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> and was born with arm stubs. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON>'s occupational therapist, <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollpeter </PERSON>, said the boy started using the mechanical arms correctly minutes after they were fitted on him Nov. 30 at <LOCATION> Carrie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tingley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. `` We put them on him one day, and he immediately started using them accurately,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pollpeter </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` He already had the muscle control mastered.'' Now all he has to do is work on improving his accuracy, she said. The arms flex up and down, and hooks open and close when <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> moves his shoulders a certain way. Thin cables attached to a switch on each arm make them move. Each arm weighs about 3 pounds and is strapped over <PERSON> Armando </PERSON>'s stubs and onto his shoulders with a small harness on his back Batteries power the arms during the day and are recharged at night, said <PERSON> Eloy </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, <PERSON> Armando </PERSON>'s prosthetist. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> is the second child to be fitted with the $ 12,000 arms at the hospital. This particular line of prostheses has been available for four years. His last pair was not automated, and he had to push the forearms against an object to get them to lock in a bent position. Many things were easier by foot than by hand as a result. He wrote with his left foot, holding the pencil between his big toe and second toe, and he used to pull on his shoes and socks with his teeth. `` When I was 5, I saw my mom drop a fork and pick it up with her toes,'' he said. `` That's how I got the idea for -LRB- holding -RRB- the pencil. I only have four toes, so I put the pencil where the space is. It's easy.'' Ms. <PERSON> Pollpeter </PERSON> said eating with the new arms has been the priority for <PERSON> Armando </PERSON>. `` It's not totally acceptable to have your feet at the table, so this is really going to help him,'' she said. `` His parents like for him to use the prostheses. That's why we were eager for him to master that skill.'' He will work at home on the other tasks, such as getting dressed and writing, Ms. <PERSON> Pollpeter </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>U.N. Report: American Teen-Agers Have Most Abortions In Developed

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American teen-agers have the highest rate of abortion in the developed world, more than double that of teen-agers in most European countries, according to a new <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report. The report released Tuesday by the world body's Population Division also found the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to have the highest teen-age pregnancy rate, contrasting with declining rates in almost every other developed country. About 9.8 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> females ranging in age from 15 to 19 are becoming pregnant on an annual basis, the highest rate among the nations studied. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> ranked second at 8.5 percent. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was lowest overall at 1 percent. The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> was lowest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at 1.2 percent, and most other European nations averaged about 3.5 percent. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 4.4 percent of women in the age group studied had abortions on a yearly basis, compared with 2.7 percent in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, 0.5 percent in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and 0.6 percent in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The report, entitled `` Adolescent Reproductive Behavior,'' deals only with developed nations. The pregnancy and abortion rates it cites represent the latest figures available for each country. `` Liberalization of abortion laws does not always bring about an increase in abortion rates,'' the report says. `` In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, a liberalization of the laws in 1975 brought about only a small increase in rates.'' `` The one outstanding characteristic of teen-agers requesting abortion is that the majority of them are unmarried,'' the report found. `` The option to carry a pregnancy to term is becoming less and less popular among pregnant teen-agers,'' the report says. `` The proportion of pregnancies that end in abortion has increased since the early 1970s.'' Examining other sexual trends, the report found that cohabitation has gained popularity among European men and women of all ages. `` In the past, couples frequently lived together for short periods before marriage, but such unions have become more and more common and may or may not result in marriage,'' it says. The survey covered <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>.

 Even while denying <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> tried through public and private diplomacy to induce the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to renounce terrorism in all forms and explicitly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The prize held out to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was a `` substantive dialogue'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a major step toward <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acceptance of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader who only two weeks ago had been condemned by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> as an `` accessory'' to acts of terrorism. With <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> already accepted by a number of West European governments, an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic isolation would have strengthened his hand in the Palestinian conflict with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and assured him a voice in any <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> negotiations. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials declared that the speech <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Tuesday failed to meet the three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acceptance. Diplomatic sources said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was so sure that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would satisfy the demands, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had notified <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassador, on Monday night that if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader followed through, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was prepared to hold the dialogue <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had long sought. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> had acted as an intermediary over the past few weeks, relaying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions and receiving in return what was taken as advance word on what <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would say. In the end, though, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, credited <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> only with `` some interesting and positive developments'' and said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader had failed to meet the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requirements. These include explicit acceptance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renunciation of terrorism in all forms. The third requirement is approval of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions affirming that all Middle Eastern states are entitled to live within secure borders. On the third point, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> found some significant movement by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the would-be parliament of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, merely said a peace conference could be held under the 1967 and 1973 resolutions. Still, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` These issues must be addressed clearly, squarely and without ambiguity. That did not happen.'' President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, meanwhile, that his administration will not meet with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> based on what <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` We've got to get a much clearer statement of everything,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy prohibits negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which is committed by covenant to dismantling <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a Jewish state. As a result, diplomatic sources said, `` pieces of paper'' were exchanged through <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, a neutralist country which has taken a sympathetic stance toward the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and hosted a meeting of a handful of American Jews with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> after <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> barred him from speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had suggested language for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to use in his speech, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> replied: `` What we have done is to respond to requests from third parties, people who said, ` Would you provide us, tell us in specific terms, exactly what your position is, what your conditions are?' And that, of course, we are happy to do.'' Referring to the way <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> dealt with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions in the speech, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said there were `` problems with all three.'' The spokesman called the `` overall tone'' of the speech positive and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> saw `` some movement'' by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on the two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resolutions, but he did not elaborate. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had met the three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions. He called <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rejection of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s speech `` gratuitous,'' and said it was based more on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s `` stubborn pro-Israel reflex than on sound diplomacy.'' <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, a senior associate at the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is `` inching along.'' But <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who served on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the first <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said, `` The problem is he is not declaring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has a right to exist.''

 After a quick start, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is falling behind the pace set by his predecessors in filling the Cabinet, causing consternation among even some of his loyalists.

Among the snags: _ A long delay in completion of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation into the background of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> may have seriously weakened Tower's prospects for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation even if he is, as expected, ultimately appointed defense secretary _ The inability of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition team to come up with a suitable job for former <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has left the wife of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> awkwardly hanging _ The contention of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential chief-of-staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> that no current member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be appointed to the Cabinet, so as not to thin <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ranks in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, has infuriated more than a few <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers, according to sources Transition and congressional <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> sources said that the edict appeared aimed at softening the blow of a no-job-offer to Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., a vigorous political supporter of the vice president from the early days of his campaign If so, it may have been a case of overkill, taking along a dozen or so other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers who had figured prominently in recent Cabinet speculation. With a lopsided Democratic majority of 259 to 175 in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, one or two fewer Republicans would n't have made all that much difference. The move had echoes of an announcement on July 30, 1964, by President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> that ended widespread speculation that he would name then-Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to be his vice presidential running mate in the coming presidential election. At a hastily arranged television appearance, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said that members of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> were too valuable to him and that it would be `` inadvisable to select any member of my Cabinet'' as his running mate. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who resigned later that summer after winning the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> nominination, accepted <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s rationale philosophically but responded that he was sorry he had to take so many good men overboard with him. In a recent interview, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has picked to be his presidential chief of staff, defended the delays and blamed them on the necessity of conducting thorough and meticulous background checks on each candidate for a Cabinet job. However, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> conceded, `` You always wish things could go faster.'' He said delays were inevitable `` as we get more and more people to be reviewed and more and more -LRB- of a -RRB- stretching resources thin.'' Little more than a week after the election, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> boasted to reporters that he was off to a quick start compared to predecessors dating back to <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. At that time, he had already designated four members of his Cabinet _ secretaries of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, Education and an attorney general and had picked a chief of staff. At a similar point in mid-November after their elections to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, former Presidents <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had not even begun to name Cabinet choices, according to a breakdown provided by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition office and cited by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his conversation with reporters. Since then, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has designated a national security adviser, a press secretary, a trade representative, a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> chief, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, a chief economist and a secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. Still, he has already dropped behind <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, who finished his Cabinet by Dec. 1, 1952, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who completed his choices by Dec. 11, 1968. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had his entire Cabinet announced by Dec. 17; <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, by Dec. 23, 1976. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, by contrast, did n't have his Cabinet selection completed until Jan. 1, 1980 Congressional sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s delay in naming a defense secretary, and his treatment of Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, had dispirited some of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s most faithful loyalists on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>$4.4 Billion Research Center Threatened by Ants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers who hope to study the secrets of nature at the government's planned $ 4.4 billion super collider may first need protection from a venomous ant with a penchant for munching its way through underground cables. A 10,000-page environmental impact statement on the project says the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> site chosen by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for the research center is in an area infested with the fire ant. The ill-tempered ant inflicts painful bites, is blamed by local residents for disabling home and farm equipment, and has caused power failures by chewing through underground cables, the department reports. Plans call for the super collider to be built in a 53-mile tunnel under what is now farmland in <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Subatomic particles will be accelerated to astronomical speeds inside the tunnel and studied by scientists hoping to learn more about the fundamental nature of matter and energy. Scientists, however, have yet to find a way to eradicate the fire ant. The Energy Department says special attention will have to be paid at the super collider site to the design of electrical facilities and other underground components; construction practices to protect workers from the ant's painful sting; and development of an environmentally sound pesticide policy. Texans who commented on the super collider project to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said fire ants `` routinely tunnel to water table depths in search of water, chewing their way through underground cables and insulation around wiring en route,'' the impact statement said. `` Fire ants appear to be attracted to electrical equipment and can cause shorts by chewing through insulation and by crowding into spaces around electrical contacts,'' the study said. The study said local utility companies and highway departments have reported problems with damage caused by the ants. Thirty years of study by federal and state agriculture officials still has not yielded an effective method of eradicating the ant, only control procedures, the study said. A <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> representative told the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that the control programs were only 80 percent effective. Fire ants also pose a health risk since their bite is painful and can sometimes lead to serious reactions in humans, the study said. For most people, a sting results in swelling, pain and itching that lasts a week, the study said. For others, immediate medical attention may be needed, especially for a few victims so sensitive to the ants' venom they go into shock. The final environmental impact statement examined all seven sites that had been in contention for the super collider, incorporating 6,000 pages of comments and letters received after the draft statement was released in August. The Energy Department announced in November it would locate the project in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>INS Plan Called Attack on Asylum for Central Americans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An attorney for a legal rights group says the government's proposals on Nicaraguan asylum-seekers constitute a broad attack on asylum for Central Americans. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> proposals could sharply reduce Nicaraguans' chances of obtaining work permits while they await decisions on asylum applications. If implemented fully, the draft <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> proposals also could result in detention for Central Americans whose asylum applications are rejected and who are awaiting final decisions on deportation. `` I regard this as a broad attack on asylum,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>, director of the political asylum project of the <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. `` The first victims are the Nicaraguans in south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> who are to be deprived of the opportunity to subsist. But tens of thousands of other asylum applicants will face unnecessary hardship on account of these measures.'' He said that while `` the immediate inspiration'' for the proposals is a huge increase in Nicaraguans seeking asylum who have come across the border in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, `` this is not a measure solely attributable to the arrival of Nicaraguans.'' Asylum applications from Salvadorans rose from 2,700 in fiscal 1987 to more than 27,000 for fiscal 1988, which ended Sept. 30. Immigration officials acknowledged that the proposals would apply to other Central American asylum seekers as well as to Nicaraguans. But they denied they are trying to discourage the filing of legitimate asylum claims by Central Americans who have a well-founded fear of persecution in their homeland. `` We have to have an orderly immigration system,'' said immigration commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` We want those with legitimate claims to immigrate and get them approved, but we must avoid abuses, and we're seeing evidence of that in south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said that in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, salesmen are offering phony packets of asylum documents to Nicaraguans and other Central Americans. Nicaraguans are particularly upset over the proposals because work permits would be withheld until after immigration officers make a determination of whether the asylum claim is legitimate. Under a July 1987 directive from then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, Nicaraguans in most instances were automatically granted permits allowing them to work here legally while their asylum requests were pending. The backlog of cases has risen steadily since then and <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said the agency is increasing efforts to review some 22,000 pending asylum claims from Nicaraguans, starting with the most recent applicants. Canceling work permits issued to Nicaraguans or not issuing work permits to new asylum applicants wo n't stop the influx of Nicaraguans into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguello </PERSON>, chairman of the public relations committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> steps are `` not going to stop people from coming,'' agreed <PERSON> Maritza </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` They come here and they're going to stay in the underground economy, underpaid.''

 The bottom is falling out of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> prime-time listings now that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has dropped five of last week's 10 lowest-rated shows. Gone from the schedule are `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>,'' `` The <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show,'' `` Raising Miranda,'' `` Dirty Dancing'' and `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday. At the other end, a repeat of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Night Court'' returned to Thursday night for a week and was the No. 1 show last week. Its regular time period this season is Wednesday. The new show, `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' was taking a night off. The rest of the top 10 were: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show,'' `` Cheers,'' `` A Different World'' and `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne,'' CBS' `` 60 Minutes,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Who's the Boss? and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` L.A. Law'' and `` Empty Nest.'' Some of the shine appeared to be off <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Moonlighting.'' Its season premiere ranked 13th, compared with last season's premiere at fifth. Another <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> season premiere, `` thirtysomething,'' ranked only 29th. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> ran the network premiere of the film `` Spies Like Us'' against <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roots: The Gift'' and came out at 17th to `` Roots''' 25th. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week for the 25th straight time. Its average, prime-time rating was 15.1; <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had 13.2; CBS 10.7. The news race was a virtual tie with less than half a rating point separating the three broadcasts. The `` CBS Evening News'' edged the others with an 11.2 rating. `` ABC World News Tonight'' had a 10.9. `` NBC Nightly News'' had a 10.8. Each rating point represents 904,000 households with television. The lowest-rated prime-time shows last week were: <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s analysis of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s news conference, `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s Law,'' `` West 57th,'' `` Dirty Dancing,'' `` TV 101,'' `` Knightwatch,'' `` Raising Miranda,'' `` The <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show'' and `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> canceled `` Van Dyke'' and `` Raising Miranda.'' `` Dirty Dancing'' was put `` on hiatus.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>'' and `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Simon'' were removed from the schedule but might return. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said it would move `` TV 101'' from Tuesday to Wednesday night. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> already has canceled another of the bottom 10, `` Knightwatch.''

 State police arrested a 35-year-old New Bedford man Tuesday and accused of kidnapping and raping a woman along Interstate 195 in the same area where six bodies have been found since July. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Veary </PERSON>, an assistant district attorney in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, declined to comment on a report by <ORGANIZATION> WBZ-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that the man was a suspect in the killings as well. <PERSON> Veary </PERSON> said the man, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, was scheduled for arraignment Wednesday morning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> on charges of kidnapping and aggravated assault stemming from an incident in August 1987 along Interstate 195 in the town of <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Undercover wildlife agents have found `` flagrant'' poaching violations and `` unsporting practices'' by waterfowl hunting businesses along the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast that led to charges against 210 people in seven states. The poaching violations come at a time when duck populations are already hurt by an eight-year drought in their breeding grounds. `` Duck numbers already are near record lows because of the drought and continued destruction of their natural habitat,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` They can not long withstand additional losses from illegal harvest.'' More than 100 wildlife service agents spent three years in an undercover investigation of 41 commercial waterfowl hunting businesses on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast, documenting more than 1,300 violations in one of the agency's biggest operations, officials said. `` During this investigation, service agents reported flagrant violations of laws intended to protect waterfowl,'' <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Law-abiding waterfowlers are outraged by these unethical and unsporting practices that betray total lack of concern for the status of waterfowl populations.'' Agents from around the country went undercover to book hunts with guides and owners of hunting businesses charging $ 65 to 500 a day who were suspected of killing waterfowl illegally and encouraging and helping customers to do likewise. Alleged violations occurred on 92 percent of the hunts, the service said. The agency said 23 hunting guides and owners were being arrested, 22 of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Indictments or charges contained in a federal document named 50 others, and 137 people were to receive misdemeanor notices of violation in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Charges include shooting more than the legal limit; `` rallying,'' or stirring up waterfowl to drive them toward hunters; use of lead shot in steel shot zones; failure to retrieve shot fowl _ wanton waste; use of electronic calls; taking birds after the season has closed or outside legal hunting hours; and tagging and record-keeping violations, such as claiming birds belonged to someone who had not hunted that day, or falsifying when birds were shot. In several cases, the service said raptors, herons, ibises and other non-game migratory birds were allegedly killed and sold to undercover agents.

 A director of a new U.S.-Soviet effort to help <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses sell everything from cosmetics to caviar in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> says he expects <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to relax its limits on foreign ownership of companies early next year. Current Soviet law requires that joint business ventures be no more than 49 percent foreign owned, but <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bregman </PERSON> of Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> APCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> said he expects this to be liberalized, possibly within the first three months of 1989. <ORGANIZATION> APCO </ORGANIZATION> is an affiliate of the law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Porter </LOCATION>, which held a news conference Tuesday to announce that <ORGANIZATION> APCO </ORGANIZATION> had set up a joint venture with <LOCATION> INFEKS </LOCATION>, a six-month-old Soviet consulting cooperative affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>. New Soviet efforts to open and restructure the country's economy offer `` access to a market of 280 million highly educated Soviet consumers with an enormous need for goods and technology,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the firm's managing partner. He said Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies are `` setting an exciting new course for East-West business relationships.'' <PERSON> Bregman </PERSON>, director of Soviet and East European services for <ORGANIZATION> APCO </ORGANIZATION>, said the new venture will help <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses set up joint operations with Soviet cooperatives and other enterprises. Speaking before a Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag and with a direct telephone hookup to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, officials said the partners in the venture would draw up final details and meet with prospective clients later this week. <PERSON> Bregman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> APCO </ORGANIZATION> hopes to double the number of U.S.-Soviet ventures by the end of next year. Ten joint U.S.-Soviet business agreements have been concluded to date, along with about 100 Soviet ventures with businesses from other countries, he said. <PERSON> Bregman </PERSON> said he looks to the day when a Soviet citizen can buy borscht made by <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> is not one of the companies now involved, but this is an example of the kind of enterprise that might result from the new agreement. <PERSON> Bregman </PERSON> declined to name companies that might deal with the Soviets through <ORGANIZATION> APCO </ORGANIZATION>, but he said they include about a dozen companies involved in food processing, pollution control, medical equipment, cosmetics, tourism and telecommunications. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company even wants to get into caviar production, he said. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gusinsky </PERSON>, INFEKS president, said from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that the Soviet enterprise is part of the economic `` perestroika,'' or restructuring, under way in his country. `` We are looking forward to developing economic relations with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies,'' <PERSON> Gusinsky </PERSON> said through a translator who also translated the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference in Russian over the telephone hookup. <PERSON> Gusinsky </PERSON> and other INFEKS officials were to arrive in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later this week. <ORGANIZATION> APCO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Margery </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON> said the company, which also has set up joint ventures with Japanese and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> businesses, would open an office in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> early next year. She said the company would provide `` one-stop shopping'' for companies wanting to do business in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, charging fees for its services. She said there were no plans for <ORGANIZATION> APCO </ORGANIZATION> to share in profits of the joint ventures it helps set up.

<HEAD>EPA Says Farming Responsible For Much Ground Water Pollution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says ground water has been contaminated by pesticides in parts of 38 states, but it cautions that more study is needed before the full extent of such pollution can be determined. The agency said Tuesday a review of 150 ground water studies over the past 10 years found 74 different chemicals in 38 states. Similar findings had been announced by advocacy groups using <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The EPA has added new information: Farming has put 46 chemicals in the ground water of 26 states and 32 chemicals got into ground water in 12 states because of `` point source'' pollution, such as an accidental spill. Unknown sources account for 28 chemicals in 12 states, not necessarily the same 12 involved in point-source contamination. `` There are dangers'' in trying to draw national conclusions from the data, which are `` not appropriate for assessing human exposure,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimm </PERSON>, acting assistant administrator in charge of pesticides. `` Many agricultural areas have not been sampled and are not statistically represented,'' he said. The studies sampled shallow sampling wells and aquifers used for irrigation in addition to drinking water. The agency said concentrations generally were below its `` health advisory'' levels for drinking water, but some were not. EPA is in the process of sampling 1,300 drinking water wells nationwide to check for 125 different chemicals according to a statistically based scheme that should yield national conclusions in late 1989 or early 1990. The studies responsible for Tuesday's findings were conducted by government agencies, universities and holders of pesticide licenses, and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it was still interviewing the authors to check the validity of their work. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, staff scientist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Misuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticides </ORGANIZATION>, said she was not surprised by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s findings `` This is the tip of the iceberg. As more samples are taken, we are going to find more instances of contamination.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, vice president for science and regulatory affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a pesticide manufacturers' trade group, agreed that the results were not appropriate for assessing human exposure, and said `` <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s current sampling is the kind of information we will look to as to whether there's a health issue.'' Until 1979, pesticides had been thought not to get into ground water, but to remain bound to soil. Since then, concern has risen as more and more contamination has been found. When <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> announced a proposed pesticides-in-ground water strategy in February, it said it knew of 19 pesticides from farming in the ground water of 24 states.

<HEAD>Economists Say Thrifts Threatened By Rising Money Costs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rising interest rates threaten to end a recent letup in losses by savings institutions, some economists say. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, losses for the nation's 3,024 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls had dropped to $ 1.6 billion in the July-September period, down from $ 3.9 billion in both the first and second quarters. Most of the improvement came in non-operating losses _ meaning institutions wrote off fewer bad loans. They dropped from $ 3.6 billion in the second quarter to $ 1.4 billion in the third. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist of the bank board, declined to predict non-operating losses in the current October-December quarter, but he said operating profits, which rose in the third quarter, will be hurt because of rising interest rates this quarter. Rising interest rates narrow the spread between what an institution has to pay for its money and what it can earn on loans and other investments. `` Interest rates do not bode well for the future,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalia </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group. The bank board released the loss figures for the third quarter two weeks ago. On Tuesday, in a more detailed report, it said the number of insolvent savings institutions continued to fall. But, it said, even as government rescues soared, other institutions were slipping. The bank board said 434 S & amp; Ls were insolvent at the end of September, down from 498 three months earlier and substantially lower from the peak of 520 at the end of last year. However, regulators had to `` resolve'' the cases of 129 insolvent institutions _ either through rescues or closures _ to whittle down the insolvent list by 86 over the first nine months of the year. That means 43 other institutions slipped into the red. In the third quarter, an additional 150 institutions were on the edge of insolvency, with capital levels between zero and 1.5 percent. Losses for the first nine months _ $ 9.4 billion _ already surpass last year's post-Depression record of $ 7.8 billion. As in the past, the losses were heavily concentrated in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and in just a few institutions in the third quarter. The 244 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts _ 114 of them insolvent _ reported losses of $ 1.7 billion. All thrifts outside of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> managed a modest gain of $ 45 million. The worst 20 institutions _ 14 of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ lost $ 1.3 billion. `` It may be misconstruing it to say, ` Hey, we're coming out of the woods.' These numbers say, ` Hey, you're still losing a lot of money.' ... It's nothing to get euphoric over,'' Regalia said. `` The hole is still bigger, it's just not getting bigger as fast. You can take some solace in that. I just would n't take too much solace,'' he said. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said the quarterly loss would have been $ 2 billion without the government actions, still a substantial improvement. But, <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said a large portion of the industry's operating income is coming from a flow of assistance income to restructured institutions. <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> said the bank board made assistance payments of $ 528 million in the third quarter, up from $ 466 million in the second quarter. Payments on government promissory notes were $ 948 million, up from $ 101 million, he said. `` There's a substantial amount of income support coming in. ... It is adding to income level, it is adding to the bottom line,'' he said. All three economists expressed concern about the effect of rising interest rates on thrift earnings in the current quarter, which will be released by the bank board in March. Also, <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> and Regalia noted that non-operating losses frequently rise sharply in the final quarter of the year because institutions often account for loan losses as they prepare their books for the end of the year. The condition of S & amp; Ls stands in stark contrast to the relative health of commercial banking. Despite more than 200 bank failures so far this year, banking as a whole posted record profits totaling $ 16.4 billion in the first nine months of the year.

<TEXT>
 Undercover wildlife agents have found `` flagrant'' poaching violations and `` unsporting practices'' by waterfowl hunting businesses along the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast that led to charges against 210 people in seven states. The poaching violations come at a time when duck populations are already hurt by an eight-year drought in their breeding grounds. `` Duck numbers already are near record lows because of the drought and continued destruction of their natural habitat,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` They can not long withstand additional losses from illegal harvest.'' More than 100 wildlife service agents spent three years in an undercover investigation of 41 commercial waterfowl hunting businesses on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast, documenting more than 1,300 violations in one of the agency's biggest operations, officials said. `` During this investigation, service agents reported flagrant violations of laws intended to protect waterfowl,'' <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Law-abiding waterfowlers are outraged by these unethical and unsporting practices that betray total lack of concern for the status of waterfowl populations.'' Agents from around the country went undercover to book hunts with guides and owners of hunting businesses charging $ 65 to $ 500 a day who were suspected of killing waterfowl illegally and encouraging and helping customers to do likewise. Alleged violations occurred on 92 percent of the hunts, the service said. The agency said 23 hunting guides and owners were being arrested, 22 of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Indictments or charges contained in a federal document named 50 others, and 137 people were to receive misdemeanor notices of violation in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Charges include shooting more than the legal limit; `` rallying,'' or stirring up waterfowl to drive them toward hunters; use of lead shot in steel shot zones; failure to retrieve shot fowl _ wanton waste; use of electronic calls; taking birds after the season has closed or outside legal hunting hours; and tagging and record-keeping violations, such as claiming birds belonged to someone who had not hunted that day, or falsifying when birds were shot. In several cases, the service said raptors, herons, ibises and other non-game migratory birds were allegedly killed and sold to undercover agents. Agents documented one case in which a dozen hunters in blinds around a pond shot as many geese as they could, killing more than 200 birds _ 139 over their limit. Wildlife service spokeswoman <PERSON> Megan </PERSON> <PERSON> Durham </PERSON> said the agents went undercover because the violations were occurring `` behind locked gates and in remote areas and it's difficult to get information any other way.'' Maximum penalties for the misdemeanors could be six months to one year in prison, and fines of $ 5,000 to $ 100,000 for individuals and $ 10,000 to $ 200,000 for organizations, depending on the charge. Maximum penalties for felony violations could be two to five years in prison and fines of $ 250,000 for individuals and $ 500,000 for organizations, depending on the charge.

<TEXT>
 Jurors in <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s tax fraud trial are being asked to decide whether items ranging from free meals to free underwear should be considered taxable income. For four hours in an overheated federal courtroom Tuesday, as jurors stifled yawns and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal dozed off, defense lawyers and government prosecutors bickered over the arcane language of the federal tax code. The issue was whether <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, a perennial minor-party presidential candidate, broke the law by failing to file federal income tax returns for any year since 1978. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> argues that he had no taxable income because all his personal expenses were paid by various corporations he controls. `` Mr. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> does not have to file income tax returns for 1979 through 1987 nor pay income taxes for that period,'' declared <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> accountant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seay </PERSON>, who was hired by defense lawyers to conduct a yearlong review of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s financial records. <PERSON> Seay </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was an employee of all the groups he headed and that under the tax code, what he received from his `` employers'' as their business expense _ including meals, lodging, plane flights, bodyguards, horseback rides and even the new set of underwear during his campaign travels _ was `` non-taxable compensation.'' What if he accepted a free trim of `` such hair as he has,'' asked defense attorney <PERSON> Odin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, prompting a grin from the balding <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. The courtroom erupted in laughter when <PERSON> Seay </PERSON> responded that it might be considered a `` fringe benefit'' from LaRouche's employers. Under questioning by government prosecutors, <PERSON> Seay </PERSON> conceded he had been denied access to financial records prior to July 1985 which were seized when federal agents raided <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, headquarters in October 1986. The accountant acknowledged he was relying on court testimony in concluding that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> had never received enough taxable income _ currently a minimum of $ 1,080 _ to require filing a tax return. <PERSON> Seay </PERSON> testified as defense lawyers pushed to wrap up their case before the end of the fourth week of the trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Besides a charge of conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six associates are accused of mail fraud and conspiracy for allegedly raising more than $ 30 million in loans from supporters without any intention of repaying them. If convicted of all 13 counts against him, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> would face a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $ 3.25 million. Another key defense witness Tuesday was <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> <PERSON> Morganroth </PERSON>, a tax lawyer from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who said he advised <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> in 1979 that he did not have to file any income tax returns. <PERSON> Morganroth </PERSON> said his opinion, endorsed at a second conference on <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s tax status in late 1984, was that the goods and services provided to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> were not payments but instead were intended to yield benefits to his publishers and other <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> entities that promoted his causes. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> told the trial jury that he had numerous contacts with <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> operatives while he was an aide to former White House national security adviser <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> in 1982-83. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said he considered their positions on such issues as Soviet intelligence, terrorism and Third World debt, but never divulged any information in return. He said he curbed those contacts when <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and defense intelligence officials warned him that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was `` a socialist, a fascist, a communist, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> and even a Democrat.''

<HEAD>Pay Raise Plan Comes with String Attached</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A presidential advisory commission is proposing a hefty pay raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but it also is pushing lawmakers toward a dilemma: whether to abandon income from speaking fees in return for higher salaries. `` Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are caught in a vise between editorial writers and reporters, who are opposed to honoraria, and voters, who are opposed to pay raises,'' said Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, who will be the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader in the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is apparent, however, that there is a serious perception problem regarding honoraria, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to consider along with the salary issue early next year,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said in a statement. The Commission on Executive, <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salaries </ORGANIZATION> met on Tuesday and approved recommendations for pay increases averaging 50 percent next year for the government's top 2,500 officials. That would send members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from their current pay of $ 89,500 to $ 135,000. But in an unusual move, the panel also included strong language linking the pay boost to a ban on congressional speaking fees, which reached a record $ 9.8 million in 1987. Such a ban would require separate action by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. House leaders have spoken out in favor of such a ban. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where members are allowed to take home more in speaking fees and are generally in greater demand as speakers, the issue is more difficult. It is now up to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to decide whether to accept or modify the commission's recommendations. He will include his decision in the budget he sends <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 9, and any pay raise would automatically take effect 30 days later unless both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to head it off. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was noncommittal on the pay raise, saying only that he looked forward to reviewing the president's suggestions. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said he would meet with <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> on the subject next week In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, leaders said they planned to support both the increase that the president recommends and the ban on outside speaking fees. `` Any honoraria known to mankind or yet to be conceived should be covered'' by the ban, said Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., the No 3 official in the Democratic leadership. But <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said leaders are braced for an onslaught of criticism from the public and from lawmakers who fear the political backlash of accepting such a large raise when their salaries already are far higher than the average American's. It appeared likely that, as in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would vote to turn down the raise and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would take the heat for allowing the 30-day clock to run out without voting on the increase. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> welcomed the pay-raise proposal, saying it `` is bound to be encouraging to the nation's federal judges. `` The commission's salary recommendations would restore to those judges the cuts in real income which have been caused by inflation over the last 20 years,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> said federal courts have been particularly hard hit by the erosion in salaries caused by inflation. `` Judges are leaving in droves,'' he said, because they can make far more money in private legal practice. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, the self-styled consumer advocate, contested the commission's argument that it was only seeking to restore purchasing power lost by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other federal officials over the past two decades. He noted that in 1964, lawmakers were paid $ 22,500. Two years ago they received a $ 12,100 increase to the current level of $ 89,500. `` It sounds like members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and their peers in the other branches of government have kept up with inflation quite well,'' he said. `` While members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have been overly generous to themselves, they have failed to act to increase wages for the 6.7 million workers who are at or below the minimum wage,'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Chinese Lab Could Boost Crop Production In United States</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Not only is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> a big grain customer of the American farmer, there's a new laboratory in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that may help develop trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in tiny organisms that protect crops from destructive insects and weeds. The new research operation was announced Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as a way to help find natural enemies of insects and weeds that threaten crops in the two countries. Ultimately, the exchange of `` biocontrol'' organisms and scientific information could help boost crop production in both <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, assistant secretary for science and education, said the new <ORGANIZATION> Sino-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collaborative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> is located at the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Under a five-year agreement with the academy, three <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> scientists will go to the laboratory next May and conduct research there for six months each year. They will work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the remaining six months of the year. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Soper </PERSON>, biocontrol research leader in the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> laboratory will be a quarantine and research facility for exchanging potential biocontrol organisms between the two countries The targeted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pests include: leafy spurge, a noxious rangeland weed; two water weeds, hydrilla and watermilfoil; and the Russian wheat aphid. <PERSON> Soper </PERSON> said the aphid is `` the most worrisome pest.'' It was first spotted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986 and has spread rapidly to wheat-growing areas. Pests of concern to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are: croftonweed, a weed so toxic to horses that they ca n't be kept on certain land; scale insects; and apple leaf mites. Next year the Chinese academy is expected to send scientists to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> laboratories in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Soper </PERSON> said scientists at four agency laboratories in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> are searching overseas to find biocontrols for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pests.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has granted 13 states a total of $ 2.9 million to help finance mediation efforts between financially strapped farmers and their creditors. La <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON>, acting administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the funds _ to be matched by the states _ will be used to `` resolve differences between other lenders and farmers'' who have loans from the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency. The money, he said, `` will help make it possible for a neutral, third party mediator to cast a fresh eye on the problem. Many disputes are resolved in this manner.'' For example, the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> and other lenders might agree to write down, or reduce, a borrower's debt or in some other way work together to help the farmer meet his obligations. The matching grants were authorized in the Agricultural Credit Act passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year. States qualifying for the FmHA grants in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 are: <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, $ 110,208; <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, $ 305,000; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, $ 431,150; <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, $ 500,000; <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, $ 75,040; <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, $ 75,000; <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, $ 168,140; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, $ 250,000; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, $ 269,870; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, $ 97,000; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, $ 500,000; <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, $ 87,440; and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, $ 25,000.

 The final $ 90 million in this year's budget for a program to help promote <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports has been allocated by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Under the Targeted Export Assistance program, or TEA as it is called, various trade organizations get government funds to carry out overseas promotion of designated agricultural products. In most cases, the sponsoring organizations put up some of their own funds in carrying out a specific project, although the amounts of those contributions vary and are subject to negotiation with the department. The level of TEA spending was set by the 1985 farm law at $ 110 million annually through fiscal 1988 and at $ 325 million in each of the following two years. However, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s appropriation act for 1989 reduced the level to $ 200 million. An initial allocation of $ 110 million was announced on Aug. 17, and the $ 90 million announced Tuesday completes the program funding for the 1989 fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The largest amount, $ 8.2 million, was reserved for applicants to promote the overseas sales of almonds, followed by $ 8.1 million for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>.

 This has been `` a decade of progress for women on television'' _ especially for female characters in prime time _ but the industry must be monitored to ensure further gains, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Working Women said. The accolade and note of caution came Tuesday as the commission released a report entitled `` Ten Years in Prime Time: An Analysis of the <ORGANIZATION> Image </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, 1979-1988,'' which examined the portrayal of women and compared the fictional panorama with the profile of real-life women during the decade. `` The 1980s mark a decade of progress for women on television. Their portrayals have become more diverse and, for the most part, more true-to-life,'' the report said. `` ... The networks get a pat on the back,'' said the study's author, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Streenland </PERSON> The study said 60 percent of female characters on the 25 top <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> rated shows in 1979 were portrayed as employed outside the home. By 1987, that figure had risen to 75 percent. By comparison, 1987 population statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> show that 56 percent of all women were in the labor force. <PERSON> Streenland </PERSON>'s study also showed TV painting an unrealistically rosy picture of the types of jobs held by women. In 1979, more than 40 percent of television's women were employed in clerical or service jobs. By 1987 only 23 percent of the women on TV had the lower skilled jobs and more than half had professional careers. The real life situation is that 47 percent of working women have clerical and service occupations and only 24 percent work in professional or managerial jobs. The report also showed that black women have become more visible on TV. In 1979 there was only one black female character on television, but by 1987, 22 percent of women characters were black.

 Three environmental groups filed suit Tuesday to force the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> to prepare an environmental impact statement before restarting the three reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>. Restarting the reactors constitutes a `` major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,'' according to the suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and announced here. Under terms of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> must prepare an environmental impact statement if such a condition exists, according to the suit. In another development, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Wednesday's editions that a key advisory panel told the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that its plan to restart the plant is flawed. The department's principal scentific advisory committee said the reactor at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> should not be allowed to return to operation until more complete inspections and analyses are made about its ability to withstand a severe earthquake. Such study could take months, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> is the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plant that produces tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen used to increase the explosive power of nuclear warheads. None of the three reactors at the 300-square-mile facility near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION> has produced the critical weapons material since last April because of scheduled maintenance and safety concerns. Last month, Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said continuing safety questions would delay the restart of <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> until at least next spring or summer. Tritium decays at the rate of 5.5 percent per year and Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have said that further idling of <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> could endanger the nation's stockpile. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday she did not believe an environmental impact statement would push back restart efforts. `` Whether or not, if they started with an <ORGANIZATION> EIS </ORGANIZATION> now, it would delay their schedule, I doubt very much,'' she said at a news conference announcing the suit. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> was joined in the suit by <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Named as defendants were <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>; <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baynard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, assistant energy secretary for environment, safety and health; and <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, acting assistant energy secretary for defense programs. DOE spokeswoman <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON> said the department had met over the past few weeks with representatives of the three environmental groups regarding an environmental impact statement. `` While we did not reach an agreement, the department does intend to meet all of its obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said there were ways to recycle tritium that would stretch out the current supply. She also said a reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons would eliminate the urgent demand for tritium. `` Anyone who proposes that we face a tritium crisis is either irresponsible or Dr. <PERSON> Strangelove </PERSON>,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said an environmental impact statement would aid restart efforts. `` They can do it as quickly as they want to if they devote the energy,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` The reason we want to bring this suit and have them begin the process is because they're obviously making decisions now. `` They're making decisions every day, they're issuing reports and the process of planning is moving along. The <ORGANIZATION> EIS </ORGANIZATION> should be part of that process. We do n't feel they should go any further without starting this process.'' The environmental groups are asking for an injunction that would prohibit the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from restarting the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> plant unless the agency conducts the environmental impact statement.

<HEAD>Pentagon to Seek Budget Increase of Two Percent For Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon is proposing a 2 percent boost in spending next year, including a pay raise for military personnel, with no new cuts in forces. The spending plan for the 1990 budget year, which begins next Oct. 1, calls for a 4.1 percent pay raise for the 2.1 million military personnel and sufficient money to maintain the level of training approved for the current budget year, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, chief spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. The 1990 budget proposal is to be formally unveiled on Jan. 9. It will disclose that there has been a one-year slip in production of the new B-2 stealth bomber `` as a result of both fiscal and technical considerations,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The spokesman declined to elaborate further on the stealth delay, noting the program is still classified. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had said previously it expected delivery of the first operational B-2 in fiscal 1991. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s disclosure of fiscal 1990 budget details was unexpected and unusual. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> normally declines to discuss any of the administration's internal budget decisions before the entire federal budget is submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The spokesman's willingness to discuss the matter, however, appeared to reflect a desire on the part of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ and for that matter, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ to reverse a four-year slide in defense spending after inflation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be free after his inauguration on Jan. 20 to amend the budget submissions, and he has indicated he might bow to congressional calls that military spending be held at current levels after accounting for inflation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he would not make any decisions until he assumes the presidency. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, in several recent speeches, has argued that zero growth is unacceptable. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> echoed that stand Tuesday. `` There are those who talk about zero-growth budgets,'' he said. `` We just want to make sure that everybody understands what that means. If you move in the direction of zero growth, it means that over -LRB- the next five years -RRB-, you have to take out at least an additional $ 100 billion'' because of projected inflation. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> request will total $ 305.6 billion in multi-year budget authority, up about $ 15.3 billion from fiscal 1989, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. That does not include military-related nuclear programs under the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> increase will include about $ 1.1 billion for the military pay raise, about $ 7 billion to cover inflation and $ 7.2 billion to provide a `` real growth'' increase of 2 percent, the spokesman said. `` This means that we can sustain the military force that we now have,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said last week, `` I expect the Pentagon to ask for a 2 percent increase, but I think they'll have a hard time getting it Their best prospect is for a freeze. There's not much sentiment up here -LRB- <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> -RRB- to increase defense spending.'' To maintain readiness and avoid further personnel or program cuts, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will propose a greatly expanded reliance on multi-year purchase contracts during the next five years, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be asked to commit itself to buy most of the nation's biggest weapons under long-term contracts, instead of debating production levels every year. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said `` there are proposals for multi-year budgeting on 32 programs. If all of this is adopted, it could result in savings of about $ 8.5 billion over the terms of these procurements.''

 <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who starred together in one of the 1960's hottest situation comedies, delivered little more than pratfalls in separate shows this season, and are no longer on CBS' schedule. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>'s new comedy `` The <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show'' has been canceled and Miss <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s new show `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>'' will leave the air, possibly only temporarily, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday in a major reshuffling of its troubled prime-time schedule. The move eliminates two of the three <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> shows produced by <ORGANIZATION> GTG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, the company established by former <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> chairman and <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> head Grant Tinker in partnership with <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>. Tinker founded <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> with his then-wife, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. The network also canceled `` Raising Miranda'' and shelved `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>,'' its on-again, off-again detetive series, and `` Dirty Dancing,'' adapted from the hit movie. It was the second schedule change this fall by the third-place network, which earlier put `` Coming of Age'' on indefinite leave and returned `` <ORGANIZATION> Kate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Allie </PERSON>'' to the air. The <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> shows had problems from the start. Both pilots were reshot and the <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> program was partially recast. They then emerged to almost universally negative reviews, even though their stars are two of the most popular sitcom performers ever. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> co-starred as husband and wife in `` The <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show,'' one of the trend-setting comedies of the 1960s, and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> starred as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> in another hit, `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show,'' in the 1970s. But this fall `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>'' and `` The Van Dyke Show'' found it impossible to make any headway against <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Growing Pains'' and `` Head of the Class,'' established hits that appeal to young audiences. They also faced <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Unsolved Mysteries.'' In last week's <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings, `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>'' and `` The <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show'' had the lowest ratings among the three networks. Similarly, `` Dirty Dancing'' and `` Raising Miranda'' were up against two <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> comedy hits, `` 227'' and `` Amen.'' `` Raising Miranda'' was the third lowest-rated show last week, <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>,'' which has had spotty showings since 1981, was unable to challenge <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Golden Girls'' and `` Empty Nest.'' CBS, however, held open the possibility that `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'' and `` Dirty Dancing'' could return. The network's announcement said only that the last broadcast of `` Annie McGuire'' in its Wednesday time slot will be on Dec. 28 and `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Simon'' will have its final airing on Saturday on Dec. 31 No return dates were set for either series. The network said `` Dirty Dancing'' will go `` on hiatus'' in January. `` The Van Dyke Show,'' starring <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, had its final broadcast Wednesday, Dec. 7, and will not return. `` Raising Miranda'' will have its last showing on Dec. 31. In other CBS announcements: _ `` Dolphin Cove,'' a new show starring <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Converse </PERSON> as an American dolphin researcher who moves to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> with his two young children, will have its debut on Saturday, Jan. 21, in the 8-9 p.m. EST time slot. Among its creators is <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Benchley </PERSON>, the author of `` Jaws'' and `` The Deep. _ `` Tour of Duty,'' the Vietnam War drama set in 1968, returns for its second season on Tuesday, Jan. 3, at 8-9 p.m. EST. To add female interest to the show, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brantley </PERSON> have been added to the cast. _ `` The <ORGANIZATION> Smothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>'' will be back for four more shows starting Saturday, Jan. 28, at 9-10 p.m. EST.

<HEAD>Law Requiring DC To Change Its Human Rights Code Is Ruled

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ruled that a law compelling the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to permit religious organizations to discriminate against homosexuals is unconstitutional. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> said Tuesday the law violated the free speech rights of <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members. `` We are thrilled and we feel vindicated,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>, a private attorney who represented the council members. The law, known as the Armstrong Amendment for its sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., imposed on <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members `` compelled speech'' that violated their First Amendment rights under the Constitution, the judge declared Under the provision, `` a majority of plaintiffs would be forced to vote in favor of adopting the amendment, which presumably requires a vote of ` yea' or ` nay.' The court finds that this vote is of sufficient communicative value as to be protected by the First Amendment,'' <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> said. `` Legislators do not generally leave their constitutional rights at the statehouse gate, and the court does not see why First Amendment rights should be an exception,'' <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> wrote. The case appears to be the first time <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has attempted to balance gay rights and religious freedom. The amendment, which would have forced the city to amend its human rights code, was tacked onto the city's 1989 budget, along with several other measures which were opposed by the district government. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had threatened to freeze the city's $ 3.2 billion budget on Jan. 1 if the council failed to change the law. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> had argued that the local law including gay rights under the human rights code, forced schools such as <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to go against its Roman Catholic tenets. The council members, acting individually, claimed their oaths of office required them to uphold the laws of the city and protections guaranteed by the Constitution. They argued that the congressional order to weaken the code was unconstitutional. The council had been scheduled to modify the human rights code at its Tuesday night meeting. Council Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said at the Tuesday night meeting: `` We hope the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will recognize the dignity of the council as a legislative body. We want to respect and work with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but there's a point beyond which we wo n't go.'' During a Friday hearing, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' ultimate authority over the district government allowed it to force changes in city law. The judge, however, rejected that argument. `` That authority is not limitless,'' <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> said. `` Congress may at any time exercise its authority as the legislature, but that exercise of authority must be constitutional.'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> proposed the amendment after a dispute between gay student groups and <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> need not officially recognize the groups, but must grant them the `` tangible benefits'' of recognition, including student activity funds. The university complied, saying it was satisfied with the ruling. Officials have said the university intends to follow the local law, despite <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts.

 A soldier was arrested Tuesday night in connection with the fatal shootings of two taxi drivers by a gunman who then bit a third driver on the hand and face during a robbery attempt, authorities said. The suspect is stationed at nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION>, said fort spokesman <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who would not release the suspect's name or give other details. In this central <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> town, one of the Yellow Cab drivers died after being shot in the head and another was unsuccessfully shot at, then bitten on the hand and forehead; the third was shot to death at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION>, police said. Before the arrest, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, legal adviser for the Police Department, said the nature of the robberies and shootings, which spanned roughly six hours beginning about 8 p.m. Monday, led police to believe the attacks were the work of one person. `` It seems they -LRB- the shootings -RRB- were connected but we ca n't say for sure if they were,'' said <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashburn </PERSON>, wife of cab company owner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashburn </PERSON>. `` We're grieved and we're in shock ourselves but it's business as usual,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashburn </PERSON>, who has owned the <ORGANIZATION> Yellow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> here for 18 years and who bought the town's other taxi company, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Cab </PERSON>, five years ago. There have been no other fatal attacks on drivers, he said, but last year, a Yellow Cab driver was wounded by a knife during an attack. <PERSON> Killeen </PERSON>, with a population of 46,300 people, is dominated by <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION>, an Army base. About 39,000 soldiers are stationed there. The Mashburns identified the dead men as <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, 20, a soldier and part-time cab driver, and <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharbino </PERSON>, 44. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, 28, was treated for minor wounds caused when the robber bit him, the Police Department report of the incidents said. <PERSON> Mashburn </PERSON> said he spoke with <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, but the cab driver `` was incoherent when I talked to him.'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> told police the assailant was black, was 5 feet 8 or 9 inches tall, weighed 180 pounds and had short hair. In the first attack, the robber called a cab and asked to be taken from <LOCATION> Killeen </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> post sometime between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. Monday, investigators said. Inside the post, the gunman robbed driver <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> of an undetermined amount and shot him to death, the police report said. There is no checkpoint at the base. A man then called a Yellow Cab to take him from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Killeen </LOCATION>. He robbed the driver and shot him to death on a street in the central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town. <PERSON> Sharbino </PERSON>'s body was found in the cab about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday after police received a call that the cab had been parked in one spot for several hours. A short time later, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> told police, a man attempted to rob him and shot at him on a <LOCATION> Killeen </LOCATION> street. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> grabbed the gunman's hand, forcing the bullet to miss him, said a Yellow Cab dispatcher in <LOCATION> Killeen </LOCATION> who would not identify himself. The gunman then bit the driver on the hand and forehead, the police report said. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was treated at a hospital and released, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, an investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> Killeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Authorities say they do not know how much money was taken in the robberies. Military officers are investigating the first attack at the base, while police are investigating all three incidents.

<HEAD>Article Calling Chinese Lazy Causes Furor In Press</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An article accusing Chinese of being lazy is causing a furor in the state-run press, sparking one paper to launch its own attack on the work habits of one-quarter of mankind. `` Our offices have turned into free tea houses for tea tasting, newspaper reading and gossip,'' went the editorial in the Worker's Daily on Tuesday `` Our workshops have become clubs for poker, chess, reading and sweater knitting.'' Another paper, Economic Information, has twice in the last week printed batches of readers' letters about the article. `` Our system needs radical surgery if we are going to eradicate this old disorder and dispose of this chronic disease,'' wrote one reader. `` We must sweep away the old system that encourages this laziness and push reform to its limits,'' wrote another. The article that started the ruckus was first published in September in a <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> newspaper and has since appeared in several Chinese publications. It tells the story that in some Japanese companies, bosses warn workers exhibiting slothful tendenices: `` Do not study the Chinese.'' `` We have no choice but to admit,'' the article says, `` that Chinese are the lazy bones of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.'' Chinese store attendants ignore customers, its workers read kung fu novels on the job and its public officials spend the whole day `` blowing the ox,'' a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> expression for chatting, the article says. `` To cure laziness,'' it says, `` we must push reform.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is in the midst of reforms that aim to enliven its once-stagnant, state-run economy and make it more responsive to the market. One of the biggest problems the country faces in raising productivity is that its workers have become accustomed to the `` iron rice bowl,'' the decades-old system of lifetime employment. Under that system, workers are paid the same no matter how hard they labor and individual enterprise is looked upon as rocking the boat. In addition, most college graduates are assigned jobs, sapping their enthusiasm for work. Today, many Chinese complain that the country's biggest problem is not its population of more than 1 billion but the fact that talent and hard work are not rewarded by society or the state. `` It happens in almost every work unit,'' said the Worker's Daily editorial. `` The young worker starts working actively but bit by bit he learns to work like everybody else.'' The government says it wants to solve this problem and has taken halting steps to smash the `` iron rice bowl'' and allow more Chinese to choose their own jobs. Workers also are regularly urged to increase their productivity. But it remains to be seen how much government efforts will change the state of labor if they are not accompanied by a fundamental change in the way society views hard work. In its editorial, the Worker's Daily hinted at the necessity for such a change although it did not say how such a change could be effected. `` Our fundamental problem is that this society lacks a mechanism to encourage people to succeed,'' it said. `` Chinese are not inherently lazy ... but the environment has made them lazy.'' <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people have for years thought of themselves as `` diligent and brave,'' the paper said, but those adjectives no longer apply. `` Only when we build a mechanism that will encourage ... the people to reach for their goals,'' the editorial said, `` will we again be worthy of calling ourselves diligent and brave.'' And then maybe, it said, `` Japanese bosses might even tell their lazy workers, ` You should study the Chinese.'''

 An undercover police officer and a suspected drug dealer were shot to death late Tuesday in a parking lot and two other suspects were wounded in a drug-deal-turned-gunfight, authorities said. The officer, the fifth <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer slain this year, was pronounced dead at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> about 10:30 p.m., 30 minutes after the shootout, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>. Two of the city's five officers killed this year were moonlighting on security jobs. The others died in the line of duty. A 34-year-old man with chest and back wounds died at <LOCATION> Parkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where two other suspects were taken, said emergency room supervisor <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>. A 17-year-old male suspect was in critical condition in surgery with wounds to the chest and abdomen, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. A 19-year-old man with wounds to both lower legs was listed in serious condition. `` It is my understanding that it was a buy-bust situation _ a drug buy _ and we had more than one officer at the scene,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON> said outside <LOCATION> Baylor </LOCATION> hospital. `` Instead of the drug deal reaching fruition, they were hijacked, as they say, shots were exchanged and our officer was fatally wounded.'' The officer was shot several times. Police spokesman <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said officers searched for at least one other suspect. Vines said details were sketchy, but the undercover officers were believed to be making a cocaine deal at the time of the shooting. No other officers were hurt. Police Detective <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said officers were questioning witnesses at the scene, a convenience store parking lot near downtown. Nearly 100 people gathered there after the shooting. One witness said he believed the officer, whose name was withheld, was shot in the head. `` These three people were just lying on the ground. The officer was face-up on the ground. They were all screaming and then other officers showed up and pointed guns,'' said <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahii </PERSON>, another witness, said he heard up to 11 shots as he used a pay telephone near the convenience store. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwak </PERSON>, owner of a food store across the street from the convenience store, said he heard the shots and then ran to door of his store to see the gunfight. `` Right up until that time, they fight each other with big guns right out on the street,'' said <PERSON> Kwak </PERSON>, 57. `` When I looked over on the street, people were running into each other and they were shooting at each other.''

 The `` Cheapskate Breakfast Couples'' will have to come up with a new name after deciding to buy a lottery ticket over a 99-cent breakfast special that won a $ 28.6 million jackpot. The five retired <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> couples, who have met on a weekly basis for the past six years, range from age 68 to 77. Two of the couples are nearing their 50th wedding aniversary. Although they had purchased lottery tickets individually before, they decided Friday to buy 11 tickets together when one of them complained that he needed money to have a tooth fixed. The winners of Saturday's jackpot are: <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Actavio </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON>; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> and Augustine Fiume; <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomartire </PERSON>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Artea </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>. The group said the $ 1,433,000 initial payment to be made Dec. 21 would be equally distributed by an attorney who is handling a trust fund for the group. Each couple will receive approximately $ 230,000 a year, for 20 years, after taxes. The winners said they had no immediate plans for spending the money, but hoped to take a cruise together. `` At this stage of the game, what ... more can we ask,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiume </PERSON>.

 Businesses are increasingly setting up shop in funeral parlors in an undertaking that gives new life to the structures. Attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmening </PERSON>, who has an office on the first floor of a 19th-century home that for 54 years was the <ORGANIZATION> Boland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortuary </ORGANIZATION>, said it's `` more relaxing for me and my clients.'' He and others are moving into majestic <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> homes that were funeral parlors in the early 1900s in former residential neighborhoods that have since been swallowed by the expanding downtown business district. The large, 1870-era structure that includes <PERSON> Harmening </PERSON>'s office easily accommodates several businesses, including an insurance company and a secretarial service. <PERSON> Harmening </PERSON> has 14-foot ceilings, a marble-topped fireplace and carved mahogany around him. He said it's much easier to relax there than in the space he rented in a modern office tower. `` I got a lot more room for the money,'' the attorney said. `` The spaciousness and graciousness of this environment is just right for inspiring the kind of work we do,'' said <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Klise </PERSON>, president of a video business that operates out of another one-time funeral parlor. A couple blocks away is the former <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Salmon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortuary </ORGANIZATION>, which now houses the <ORGANIZATION> Peoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, including a barracks-like dormitory and recreation room.

 It took 29 hours, 47 minutes and 12 seconds, but when it was over, three subway buffs claimed to have passed through more stations in a single trip than anyone else in transit history. They emerged from the underground Tuesday with tales of a sunrise over <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, pastry under <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> and a squalid ladies' room in <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` We're here, grubby but triumphant,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON>, trip leader. `` And all on one token. We never left the system!'' Because of subway delays, the three friends _ Temple, 28, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanner </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 29 _ finished almost three hours behind schedule. Seizing an opportunity brought by the opening of three new subway stations _ the first in 20 years _ the trio claimed to be the first people to ride through every station of the newly enlarged system. With 466 stations and 232 miles of track, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s subway system is easily the nation's largest. The 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> lists it as the subway system with the most stations. After the expedition ended, reporters asked the obvious question: `` Why?'' `` Because it's there,'' Temple responded `` It's something I've always wanted to do, being something of a subway junkie. The trio said the low point of their trip came Monday night on the trip to <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a one-hour, 45-minute ordeal on an unheated train that often slowed to a crawl behind a trash collection train. `` We were tired and frustrated,'' said <PERSON> Vanner </PERSON>. `` We were questioning our sanity.''

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 I am both proud and happy to meet with you today, here in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, after an arbitrary American decision barred me from going to you there. I extend deep gratitude to all nations, forces and international organizations and personalities who backed our people and supported its national rights ... I also thank the Western European nations and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for their latest stands toward our people and I invite them to take further steps to positively evolve their resolutions in order to open the way for peace and a just settlement in our region, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. We set out in the <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liberation </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Organization </LOCATION> to look for realistic and attainable formulas that would settle the issue on the basis of possible rather than absolute justice while securing the rights of our people to freedom, sovereignty and independence; ensuring for everyone peace, security and stability; and sparing <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> wars and battles that have been going on for 40 years. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s response to all this has been the escalation of its settlement and annexation schemes; the fanning of the flames of conflict with more destruction, devastation and bloodshed; and the expansion of the confrontation fronts to include brotherly <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which was invaded by the ocupation troops in 1982, an invasion punctuated with slaughters and massacres perpetrated against the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples, including the <PERSON> Sabra </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> massacres. It is painful and regrettable that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government alone should continue to back these aggressive and expansionist schemes as well as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s continued occupation of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> territories, its crimes, and its iron-fist policy against our children and women. It is painful and regrettable too that the American government should continue refusing to recognize the right of 6 million Palestinians to self-determination, a right which is sacred to the American people and other peoples on this planet. Our people does not want a right which is not its own or which has not been vested in it by international legitimacy and international law. It does not seek its freedom at the expense of anyone else's freedom, nor does it want a destiny which negates the destiny of another people. Our people refuses to be better or worse than any other people. Our people wants to be the equal of all other peoples, with the same rights and obligations. While we greatly appreciate the free American voices that have explained and supported our position and resolutions, we note that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration remains uncommitted to even-handedness in its dealings with the parties to the conflict. It continues to demand from us alone the acceptance of position which can not be determined prior to negotiations and dialogue within the framework of the international conference. It -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has also reaffirmed its rejection of terrorism in all its forms, including state terrorism, emphasizing its commitment to its past resolutions in this regard, and to the resolution of the Arab summit in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> in 1988, and to U.N. Resolutions 42-159 of 1987 and 61-40 of 1985, and to what was stated on this subject in the <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> Declaration of 7 November 1985. This position, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, is clear and free of all ambiguity. And yet, I, as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, hereby once more declare that I condemn terrorism in all its forms, and at the same time salute those sitting before me in this hall who, in the days when they fought to free their countries from the yoke of colonialism, were accused of terrorism by their oppressors, and who today are the faithful leaders of their peoples, stalwart champions of the values of justice and freedom. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> bears a historic, extraordinary responsibility toward our people and their rights. More than 40 years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, in its Resolution 181, decided on the establishment of two states in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, one Palestinian Arab and the other Jewish. Despite the historic wrong that was done to our people, it is our view today that the said resolution continues to meet the requirements of international legitimacy which guarantee the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> people's right to sovereignty and national independence. In my capacity as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee, presently assuming the functions of the provisional government of the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, I therefore present the following Palestinian peace initiative: First: That a serious effort be made to convene, under the supervision of the secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the preparatory committee of the international conference for peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> _ in accordance with the initiative of President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, which President <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> presented to your Assembly toward the end of last September and which was supported by many states _ to pave the way for the convening of the international conference, which commands universal support except from the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Second: In view of our belief in international legitimacy and the vital role of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, that actions be undertaken to place our occupied Palestinian land under temporary <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> supervision, and that international forces be deployed there to protect our people and, at the same time, to supervise the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from our country. Third: The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will seek a comprehensive settlement among the parties concerned in the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, including the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other neighbors, within the framework of the international conference for peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> on the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338 and so as to guarantee equality and the balance of interests, especially our people's rights in freedom, national independence, and respect the right to exist in peace and security for all. If these principles are endorsed at the international conference, we will have come a long way toward a just settlement, and this will enable us to reach agreement on all security and peace arrangements. I come to you in the name of my people, offering my hand so that we can make true peace, peace based on justice. I ask the leaders of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to come here under the sponsorship of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, so that, together, we can forge that peace. And here, I would address myself specifically to the Israeli people in all their parties and forces, and especially to the advocates of democracy and peace among them. I say to them: Come let us make peace. Cast away fear and intimidation. Leave behind the specter of the wars that have raged continuously for the past 40 years.

 The dollar closed slightly higher against the Japanese yen Wednesday, while share prices rebounded on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 123.35 yen, up 0.29 yen from Tuesday's close of 123.06 yen. After opening at 123.35 yen, it ranged between 123.25 and 123.45 yen.

The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to release the figures later Wednesday. In the foreign-exchange market, dealers said the dollar came under modest downward pressure following speculative profit-taking. Currency dealers noted that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trading was slow ahead of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures. They said the market expects the report to show an October trade deficit of $ 10 billion to $ 11 billion, close to the $ 10.46 billion shortfall posted in September.

 From his wheelchair, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> is reaching around the globe to help victims of the Armenian earthquake. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, a disabled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, is one of few dozen ham radio operators across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who are relaying information between survivors in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and worried <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> relatives. With telephone lines either down or jammed with calls, ham radio has become the fastest and most reliable way to reach people in the cities of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kirovakan </PERSON>, where a Dec. 7 earthquake killed at least 55,000 people and injured 13,000. `` Right now, ham radio is the only way to actually make contact with the stricken areas and have someone find out for you whether your relatives are OK,'' said <PERSON> Dikran </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaligian </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, based in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>. Fueled by strong coffee and unfiltered cigarettes, the 53-year-old <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> is spending 20-hour days in his wheelchair at a desk piled 3 feet high with electronic equipment. Though a paraplegic, he has full use of his arms and seems to be in constant motion _ twirling dials, pecking at a computer keyboard, answering the telephone and speaking into his prized, vintage-1953 microphone with the calm, authoritative voice of a former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer. Since Friday, <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> has left his post for only three to four hours of sleep a night. `` I've got about two more days before I crash,'' he said Tuesday afternoon. `` Then somebody else will have to take over.'' From a 70-foot antenna atop his house in this working-class community north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> beams a high-frequency, 1,000-watt signal to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and completes a chain of technology and sympathy that stretches a third of the way around the globe. At one end of the chain are Armenian-American families who have given the names and addresses of hundreds of relatives to the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a 78-year-old organization also based in <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>. The society has passed the names on to the ham operators, who are contacting colleagues throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in search of information. For most of the past week, for example, <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> has been in nearly constant contact with <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Goncharsky </PERSON>, a ham operator in the <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION> who speaks English well and has a powerful transmitter. <PERSON> Goncharsky </PERSON>, in turn, has been in touch with ham operators in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. And they have been gathering information in person, by telephone or with hand-held radios used by rescue workers. So far, the news received here has mostly been good. `` It was a great relief,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulbankian </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Southboro </LOCATION>, who learned Sunday via the ham network that his 23-year-old sister, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON>, was unharmed. `` She sent us a telegram to say she was OK, but we did n't get it for two days and we were really worried.'' While no deaths have yet been reported through the network, `` it probably will not be long before we come to that,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Megerdichian </PERSON>, of the relief society. `` It's going to be a sad situation, but I think we're going to have to tell -LRB- the relatives -RRB- either way, good news or bad.'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> is no stranger to disaster relief efforts. In more than 30 years as a ham operator, he said, he has participated in several similar efforts, including last summer's Jamaican hurricane and the 1985 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> earthquake. Since a spinal injury from mortar fire in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> gradually worsened and left him in a wheelchair in 1977, he said, he has spent most of his time either fighting for the rights of the handicapped or talking on the radio frequencies set aside by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for amateur _ or ham _ operators. `` I personally never realized it until I got on the boat myself, but there are a lot of people out there who are isolated at home, and ham radio gives them a way to reach out to people around the world,'' he said. `` A disaster like this is sad, but it gives you the chance to show that Americans care.''

 Residents are tying white ribbons around town to solemnly remember a tornado that killed six people a year ago today and caused $ 35 million in damage but strengthened the community's ties to each other. `` I think the greatest thing that has arisen from the tornado is something that ca n't be measured,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>. `` The attitude and spirit of this community now is one that believes in itself. It believes it can overcome anything that is put in its path.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s two-bedroom frame house was lifted from its foundation just before the tornado touched down around 10 p.m. The tornado destroyed 146 homes and 30 businesses, and damaged or destroyed 200 apartments along a three-mile path. More than 200 people were injured. `` I heard the Lord's voice that night and he told me we would be OK,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` And sure enough, we have come back. We made it through.'' The estimated $ 35 million in damage was exacerbated two weeks later by heavy rains that flooded parts of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, which is across the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about 10 miles west of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. And just after New Year's, the town was covered with a foot of snow Residents in the city of 28,000 are recalling the death and destruction this week by adorning trees and mailboxes with white ribbon, some of it provided by the mayor's office. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 26, said the storm has left a deeper mark. `` We pulled together,'' she said Monday. `` We all helped each other. We found love for our neighbors.'' One of her neighbors, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> relaxed this week with her two young children in a remodeled living room. Before the storm, it was a bedroom. `` That night, I grabbed my child's mattress and put it over us in the hall. I still know right where that mattress is. A big tree fell right on the bed where we had been sleeping,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` Thank God we moved quickly.'' The year of rebuilding has kept a 10-member city design and review commission busy, <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said. The panel was established a few months before the storm to devise long-term plans for uniformity of new buildings. `` The idea was that it would be a very slow, evolutionary pace,'' he said. `` Needless to say, when the tornado came through, it accelerated that evolution.''

 Authorities say they are investigating reports a fire in a state prison that killed 20 inmates in an overcrowded dormitory was sparked by paint thinner thrown during a fight. Six prisoners were injured, three seriously, in the blaze Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leon </ORGANIZATION> state penitentiary in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, the state capital and a northeastern industrial city of nearly 2 million residents. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, state communications director, said a preliminary investigation indicated the fire was an accident. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said it appeared a lighted candle ignited a curtain around an altar to the Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>, patron saint of this predominantly Roman Catholic nation. The blaze spread, he said. But authorities were looking into reports a prisoner threw paint thinner during a fight inside the ward and another inmate ignited the thinner to start the fire, <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. `` There were an extraordinary amount of candles in the ward because we just celebrated the Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> festival,'' he said. Prisoners were allowed to set up small altars near their beds on the annual holiday, celebrated Monday, he said. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said 116 prisoners were housed in the ward, designed for 70 inmates, when the fire broke out at 3:00 a.m. Tuesday. `` The mattresses also caught fire and there was a lot of smoke. The mattresses were made of a material that does n't burn easily, but unfortunately it creates a lot of toxic smoke,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. `` Some of the prisoners lost consciousness and were consumed by flames,'' he said. <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Payton </PERSON>, prison personnel director, said in an interview that it was `` unavoidable'' that prisoners smuggled paint thinner and glue into the wards to use as inhalants. But, she said, `` The official version is that it was an accident unless the investigators tell us differently.'' Ms. <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> said 2,156 inmates were housed in the one-story prison, which originally was designed for 800. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said a new penitentiary under construction is scheduled to be completed by April. At least 60 soldiers and state police patrolled outside the prison Tuesday night, but officials said the situation was calm.

<TEXT>
 The cast of the struggling Broadway play `` Checkmates'' got some dramatic news: The comedy was bankrolled in part by an accused drug trafficker serving 28 years to life for attempted murder. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a producer of the play at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s 46th Street Theater, is an inmate at <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, his lawyer, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, confirmed. The play's manager, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Somlyo </PERSON>, said Tuesday he was shocked at the news and had removed <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' name from the marquee. `` It's quite unnerving to us all,'' <PERSON> Somlyo </PERSON> said in a telephone interview before going to break the news to the cast. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 26, who with a partner put up half the $ 770,000 it cost to take the show to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>, was indicted Dec. 6 in a federal case said to have cracked a multimillion-dollar international cocaine ring. He is charged with conspiracy and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute for being part of an organization that stretched from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office here said. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, helped finance the play first in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and then on Broadway through their Los Angeles-based Y NOT Productions, <PERSON> Somlyo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> shared the financier's role with one of the biggest names in theater. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nederlander </PERSON>, whose organization owns more live theaters than any other in the country, was a 50-50 partner with Y NOT when `` Checkmates'' opened. <PERSON> Nederlander </PERSON> bowed out in September under a contract provision that allowed him to abandon his investment if returns did n't justify further participation, <PERSON> Somlyo </PERSON> said. Until <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> KCBS </ORGANIZATION> reported on <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' background Monday night, those involved with the play thought of him as just what the playbill says: A <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> native who has business interests in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, the target of the murder attempt for which <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was convicted, said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> accused him of stealing money from his drug operation. `` He threw me out of the car and asked me, did I do it?'' <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> said. `` I said ` No.' He pushed me out and told me to run. I said, ` For what? I'm a guy, so why run?' He pointed a gun at me, told me he was sorry. I said ` For what? If you got ta do it, you got ta do it.' And he shot me twice, and the gun jammed.'' <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> left him for dead, but he recovered and testified at the trial. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> began serving his sentence in the spring. Y NOT's lawyer, whose name, coincidentally, is <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, says there was no sign the money to finance the play came from illegitimate sources. `` He said he was in real estate and limousines, and I know he was buying some hair salons,'' recounted the attorney, who met the other <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> before he was incarcerated. `` He seemed like a legitimate business guy.'' `` The money always was in the form of a check,'' he said. `` If drug money deals in greenbacks, I did n't see any of them.'' <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, producer <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' lawyer, declined to discuss his client's role in the play or possible sources of income There was no telephone listing for <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. The show, meanwhile, goes on despite mostly negative reviews and a somewhat disappointing turnout. The comedy, which opened Aug. 4, contrasts the lives of an affluent young black couple _ <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Denzel </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who starred in the movies `` Soldier's Story'' and `` Cry Freedom'' _ with an older, more traditional black couple played by veterans <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON>. Ticket sales bring in enough to cover expenses, said <PERSON> Somlyo </PERSON>, who predicted word-of-mouth endorsements would broaden the audience to include more of the white, mainstream theater crowd. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was indicted along with 12 others in the drug trafficking case. The man investigators described as `` Tall Mike'' who allegedly `` received 100-kilo quantities of cocaine and caused their distribution and storage'' had seemed the perfect backer to the manager of `` Checkmates.'' `` Here I was sending him memos and letters,'' <PERSON> Somlyo </PERSON> said. `` I sort of feel like I've been cheated by not being informed.''

 Her home destroyed by the Armenian earthquake, <PERSON> Unara </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexanyan </PERSON> has been living in a beat-up jacket, sleeping on rubble-strewn streets and keeping warming around bonfires. `` I do n't have anything _ no furniture, nothing,'' she said above the bustle of families unloading bundles of their sole belongings at the <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> airport. Mrs. <PERSON> Alexanyan </PERSON> was en route to an unknown destination as part of the government's relocation efforts for the estimated 500,000 people left homeless by the Dec. 7 quake. She said a sister and three grandchildren were missing and among the dead. As the last survivors are being pulled from the wreckage of apartment buildings, schools and factories, the focus is turning to rebuilding the lives of people who, like Mrs. <PERSON> Alexanyan </PERSON>, lost everything. <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>'s streets were jammed last weekend with rescue vehicles, trucks and buses, and private cars filled with people fleeing for other parts of the republic. The dislocation aggravates an already serious refugee problem in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. More than 180,000 people fled to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> from adjoining <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in the three weeks before the tremor after at least 31 people were killed in ethnic violence. Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said Monday that too many cars were impeding the rescue effort and that the army had been ordered to keep non-essential vehicles off tge roads into <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, which was nearly totally destroyed. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Tuesday that 7,300 people, mostly women and children, were sent to sanitariums, vacation camps and other places in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviet officials say 50,000 people can be accommodated in such places and that evacuees will be cared for free of charge. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> told a news conference the effort to move the homeless out of damaged cities started slowly because no one wanted to leave without knowing what happened to missing relatives. `` In the first three days we could n't do anything to evacuate people. We tried to tell people, ` You have to take the children out. You have to take the women and old people out.''' he said. `` The first three days no one would listen. They still were in a state of shock. Every family lost somebody.'' Now, he said, people have started asking to be evacuated, or for tents at least. Throughout, there has been enough food for the homeless, and even those camped around bonfires in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> all had food with them, he reported. Many huddled and waited around bonfires made of cardboard and debris. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Asatyan </PERSON> sat at a fire outside her home. The 130-year-old, single-story structure still stood, but she was afraid to go back inside. Asked what she was going to do, she said: `` We are waiting. Whatever the authorities say.'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> has pledged the devastated cities will be rebuilt in two years, despite the country's economic difficulties.

<HEAD>Bombs Free 200 From Prison, Sinhalese Extremists Suspected</HEAD>

 Bombs set by suspected anti-government militants ripped open a wall of a suburban prison, enabling more than 200 convicts to escape, authorities said today. Two prisoners were killed by guards. Tuesday night's prison break was the second in as many weeks and the largest ever at <LOCATION> Welikade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, which houses about 1,500 convicts. On Dec. 4, suspected Sinhalese extremists dressed in army uniforms overpowered guards at a prison in central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and freed six colleagues. A military spokesman, who can not be identified under briefing rules, said Tuesday night's escape apparently was engineered by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist Sinhalese group trying to topple the government and disrupt next Monday's presidential elections. Heavily armed troops searched passenger buses and vehicles entering the capital today. Police imposed an indefinite curfew in northern neighborhoods near the prison and went house to house searching for the escapees. The military spokesman said about 25 gunmen opened fire and threw small bombs at the south wall of the prison. The explosions also distracted guards in other sections of the facility, allowing other inmates to scale the walls and escape, they said. `` It was a well-organized operation, pre-planned and possibly done with inside connivance,'' the official said. Guards opened fire, killing at least two inmates, the spokesman said. He said at least 220 prisoners escaped in six vehicles. Later, they raided a laundry about a half-mile from the prison and switched their prison uniforms for civilian clothes, the official said. At least 15 escapees were caught early today about seven miles from the prison, he said. The spokesman said authorities believed other convicts reached the town of <LOCATION> Kelaniya </LOCATION>, five miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, and escaped by boats down the <LOCATION> Kelani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The front, which staged an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1971, opposes the government's efforts to end the 5-year insurgency by Tamil rebels fighting for an independent homeland in the north and east of this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> nation. The Sinhalese, who are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>, make up 75 percent of the island's 16 million people and control the government and the military. The Tamils, who are Hindu and account for 18 percent of the population, claim they are denied jobs and education by the Sinhalese.

 A Jewish businessman interested in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s real estate agreed to pay $ 65 million for the assets of the scandal-plagued ministry, but refused to say if he would allow its evangelical operations to continue The head of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s religious successor, however, said the deal means merely a change in landlords and purchaser <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> told him he was `` sensitive'' to the religious operation. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, a nonpracticing Orthodox rabbi from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, bought the assets Tuesday for $ 10 million less than the value placed on it by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Banktruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, and only a little more than half of what he offered a month ago. Reynolds approved the cash sale after polling major creditors at a hearing. Most said it was the best deal they would get for what once had been a $ 160 million empire. `` As far as I'm concerned, the jig is over _ I'm approving the sale,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, a 34-year-old real estate magnate, on Monday bid $ 36.25 million at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, one week after <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and three former associates were indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Mernick increased his bid to $ 65 million after meeting Tuesday with attorneys for the ministry and creditors. `` We're excited,'' <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> told reporters outside the courthouse after <PERSON> Reynold </PERSON>'s decision. `` We're very excited and happy we won. We look forward to being here.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park and accompanying satellite television operation were left behind by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> in March 1987 after he admitted he had a sexual liaison with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and had her paid to keep quiet about it. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> said he would consider keeping <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> operating as a Christian park. However, he would not answer questions about whether <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> would be able to continue leasing the television ministry and church at Fort Mill. `` We are in the middle of ongoing discussions'' with <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> said, adding that he would outline plans within two weeks. The assets purchased include the satellite network carried on more than 800 cable systems; 1,700 undeveloped acres in northern <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>; two 500-room hotels, one unfinished; and a water park. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> said in October that he was interested in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> `` purely as a real estate deal.'' Sources close to <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> said he intends to hold onto the undeveloped land for up to 10 years as its value rises, and to come up with a plan for the hotels and TV network, The <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Observer reported today. The sources told the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Mernick </ORGANIZATION> is prepared to absorb $ 12 million in operating losses on <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in the first year alone. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, president of the nonprofit <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> and pastor of the church, said <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> told him he was `` sensitive'' to the religious operation. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> still wants to buy <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, or at least the church, hotel, television network and studios. `` What we've done is switch landlords. Our future depends on negotiations with the new landlord,'' he said. The ministry filed for reorganization under bankruptcy laws in June 1987, and attempts to sell it had included two auctions before Tuesday. Had no acceptable bid been submitted, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> would have been broken up and sold, trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. `` After the fiasco we had yesterday in getting people to bid, this is a relief,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. In an Aug. 18 appraisal, <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets would be worth $ 76 million to $ 85 million if sold piecemeal. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said the property is worth $ 75 million. A month ago, <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> offered $ 115 million, $ 50 million in cash. But <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> rejected the bid, saying there were inadequate assurances that <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> would pay the remaining $ 65 million. The purchase price would pay in full the $ 40 million in claims of secured creditors, those whose claims are secured by collateral such as land or buildings. It would also pay $ 5 million in administrative costs. The rest would be divided among three groups of creditors: the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is claiming about $ 60 million in taxes; the <ORGANIZATION> Lifetime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, or major <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> contributors, who are seeking at least $ 20 million; and unsecured creditors, whose claims total $ 10 million to $ 13 million. Bidders this week included <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Karas </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahakel </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> state senator who owns 15 television and radio stations. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who previously submitted a bid, had no comment on the sale.

 The first five-minute test for AIDS has been approved by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, and authorities said it is 99.6 percent accurate and offers the fastest results of any tests for the deadly disease. The test was cleared Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Its maker, Worcester-based <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bioscience </ORGANIZATION>, said it should be on the market in a few weeks. `` This technical advance should help make testing available to all who want to be tested,'' <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It will also be particularly useful in remote areas of the world that lack the facilities for earlier approved tests.'' The results of those earlier tests _ now the mainstay of AIDS screening _ frequently are not available for weeks. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bioscience </ORGANIZATION>, said the new test, called the Recombigen HIV-1 Latex Agglutination Test, should be useful anywhere that quick results are important. `` The big boon is that it's fast, and it will be useful in Third World countries and places where lab facilities might be less than ideal in order to screen large populations in a rapid, simple way,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Skolnik </PERSON>, a virologist at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Medical Center. The test is 99.6 percent accurate, <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> said. But the company recommends that as with the current screening test, called the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or <LOCATION> ELISA </LOCATION>, blood samples that are positive for the AIDS virus be confirmed by a time-consuming, backup test called the Western blot. The speed of the Recombigen means those who are free of the virus are likely to be given the good news immediately, <ORGANIZATION> Buck </ORGANIZATION> said. But those who are probably infected will be told further testing is necessary. Like other AIDS tests, this one checks for AIDS infection by spotting antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. `` All of the present -LRB- ELISA -RRB- tests require, under the best of circumstances, three to five hours,'' <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> said. `` This test requires three to five minutes.'' Unlike the <LOCATION> ELISA </LOCATION>, which requires labs and technicians, the new test can be given under crude conditions where even refrigeration is lacking. Experts believe this should make the test useful in places like <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where acquired immune deficiency syndrome is widespread and where blood is frequently not screened before transfusions. <PERSON> Teena </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the test also may be given in many settings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, such as venereal disease clinics. `` In a lot of the voluntary testing centers, there is a huge proportion of people who do n't come back to find the answer,'' she said. `` The ones who are most likely to be positive are the ones who are most likely to chicken out.'' Other potential uses include testing trauma patients in emergency rooms and checking organ donors before transplants. Buck predicted the test will account for 10 percent to 15 percent of all AIDS testing during its second year on the market. It will be sold to health care professionals for $ 10 per test, he said. Although other companies are working on quick AIDS tests, <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> said she believes it will be at least a year before <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bioscience </ORGANIZATION>'s nearest competitor wins approval. The new test is based on a portion of the protein that makes up the outer jacket of the AIDS virus. This protein, which is made through genetic engineering, is coated onto tiny white latex beads. AIDS antibodies in blood are attracted to the protein, and when they come together, the latex beads form clumps. AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

 The captain of an Indian merchant ship struck by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> missile said he was told by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> his vessel was out of a restricted training area before it was accidentally hit, killing a crewman. `` I was being guided by the missile facility,'' said Capt. <PERSON> P.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirchandani </PERSON>, who spoke with reporters Tuesday after bringing the 550-foot <PERSON> Jag </PERSON> <PERSON> Vivek </PERSON> into port here for repairs. `` I heard a noise and saw splinters flying out onto the deck,'' the 34-year-old captain said of Monday's incident, which occurred when his ship was about 80 miles north-northwest of the island of <LOCATION> Kauai </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrout </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mirchandani </PERSON>'s contention that his ship was being guided by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> controllers at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> was under investigation `` Everybody has a little tiny piece of the puzzle and it's going to take a while to put all these pieces together and figure out just what happened,'' <PERSON> Shrout </PERSON> said at news conference at <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Attorney <PERSON> Leondard </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcantara </PERSON>, representing the <PERSON> Jag </PERSON> <PERSON> Vivek </PERSON>'s owners, said controllers at the missile range radioed the ship at about 8 a.m. Monday that it was entering a restricted area. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> `` gave them a course to steer around it. They steered on that course for approximately two to three hours and were then told they were clear of the missile range, and 40 minutes later they were struck by a missile,'' said <PERSON> Alcantara </PERSON>. The 12-foot-long, 1,000-pound unarmed Harpoon missile hit the ship from the stern at about noon, tearing through the upper level of the pilot house and emerging with sufficient force to put a large dent in one of the ship's cranes before falling into the sea. The radio officer, K.T. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, a 36-year-old Indian citizen, was wounded by shrapnel and died after being carried to the bridge, <PERSON> Alcantara </PERSON> said. An FA-18 attack fighter from the aircraft carrier USS Constellation fired the missile at a derelict ship being used for target practice, but it's infrared guidance system later locked onto the Jag <PERSON> Vivek </PERSON> and it veered in that direction, <PERSON> Shrout </PERSON> said. At the time, the jet was 45 miles from the merchant ship, well out of visual range, he said. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has not accepted responsibility for the accident, pending its investigation, the commander of the <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chadwick </PERSON>, went aboard the Jag <PERSON> Vivek </PERSON> as it approached <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> to express condolences to the captain for the loss of his crewman, <PERSON> Shrout </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> also has offered any assistance it can provide to the merchant ship and its crew, he said. The <PERSON> Jag </PERSON> <PERSON> Vivek </PERSON> was expected to remain in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for a few days to repair the demolished radio room before resuming it's voyage to <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> with 25,600 tons of wheat it picked up at <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, officials said. The Indian government declined comment on the accident.

Eight families claim polluted water from the wells caused the deaths. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlichtmann </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the families, said he would attempt to introduce the report as evidence in hearings that begin today in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The hearings in the controversial, 6-year-old case are to determine whether <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> intentionally concealed evidence during a 1986 trial in which it was cleared of liability for the pollution. <PERSON> Schlichtmann </PERSON> claimed the report marked the `` first time the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> property polluted'' the two wells. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials, however, said the report merely summarized existing information and did n't blame any particular sites for causing the well pollution. The report was based on surveys done in the past six months. `` The material is not designed to bolster allegations of what conditions were like 20 years ago,'' when the well contamination first occurred, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Deputy Regional Administrator <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Keough </PERSON> said. `` All we've done is to do an investigation of soil and groundwater sampling as we begin to finalize a cleanup program'' for the area of the wells. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Facher </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>, reiterated the company's contention that pollution at its former site did n't contaminate the wells <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> owned a tannery on a 15-acre parcel of land from 1978 to 1983, when it sold the tannery and property to the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> Co. `` The property contains the most extensive area of contaminated soil and the highest concentrations of contaminants anywhere within the wells ... site,'' the report by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said. Among contaminants the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has identified in the area are polychlorinated biphenyls, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. The two wells were shut down in 1979 after several toxic contaminants were found. They had supplied water since 1964 to a neighborhood in this city of 36,000 about 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The report said the <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> property and five other nearby sites `` have contributed and are continuing to contribute to the groundwater contamination in the aquifer supplying water'' to the two wells. It does not conclude which sites were responsible for contaminating the wells and said the sites currently pose no health risk. A federal district court jury in July 1986 cleared <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> of liability. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> last January denied the families a new trial after their attorney learned of a 1983 report that said dumping on the tannery property may have contributed to groundwater pollution near the wells. But the 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> last week ordered <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> to hold new hearings to determine whether defense lawyers `` knowingly and intentionally'' withheld the report from the families. The original suit contended that four parties were responsible for the pollution: <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Riley </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Unifirst </ORGANIZATION>, a uniform supply company. <ORGANIZATION> Unifirst </ORGANIZATION> settled before the trial and <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> settled for a reported $ 8 million halfway through the trial.

<TEXT>
 An award-winning convict journalist who gave authorities information about <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s pardon-selling scandal received a favorable clemency recommendation from the state <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The board recommended Tuesday that <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>'s life sentence for a 1965 murder be reduced to 75 years in prison, with parole eligibility after 25 years. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, who has served 23 years, could win his freedom in about two years if Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> goes along with the board's recommendation. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, 43, a former editor of the inmate news magazine The Angolite at the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION>, originally was sentenced to die for the slaying of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodden </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> convenience store clerk shot after a bungled robbery. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1972 after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down the state's capital punishment law. Two years ago, <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> aided an investigation that led to the conviction and imprisonment of former <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsellus </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. After being approached by a corrections official who sought $ 15,000 in return for a pardon, <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> went to federal authorities The clemency request was opposed by the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> prosecutor and members of <PERSON> Bodden </PERSON>'s family. `` I do n't think he's rehabilitated enough to be out on the street,'' said <PERSON> Sadie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodden </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bodden </PERSON>'s widow. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> is the second editor of the prison magazine to come up for clemency this month. Last week, the governor rejected a pardon board recommendation for <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON>, another killer who is still editor at the <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> prison. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s decision `` righted a great wrong'' since other convicts who gave information to authorities about the pardon-selling scandal had been freed. `` I am so deeply grateful to the board for the forgiveness and mercy they have shown,'' she said. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> has been before the <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> five times and received four favorable clemency recommendations, but has been unable to receive approval from the governor's office.

 The Israeli army is giving top priority to training its troops to withstand nerve and mustard gas attacks, fearing Arab enemies could unleash such weaponry at any time, senior military commanders say. The commanders briefed reporters Tuesday at this base in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during combat drills in which soldiers staged gun and tank battles using live ammunition while wearing their new heavy chemical-repellent gear. All soldiers have in the past year been issued the charcoal-lined uniforms, gas masks, poison detection tape, rubber gloves and boots. They take it with them in their kitbags whether they are assigned to combat duty in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> or to police the occupied territories, said Lt. Col. S., an organizer of the anti-chemical warfare campaign. Under Israeli press regulations, commanding officers may only be identified by the first letter of their first or last names. `` We are taking the threat of chemical war very seriously, especially after the Iran-Iraq war,'' in which such weapons were widely used, Lt. Col. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> said. Drills such as one in which two dozen troops stormed a mock village of cement shacks nicknamed <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> are taking up at least a quarter of the average soldier's training time this year. Some soldiers are ordered to wear the gear in almost every exercise the army conducts, the officers said. The aim is to train the soldiers to protect themselves and fight despite a rain of poisonous gas, they said. The gear is so uncomfortable that some of it, such as the gloves, are not worn during drills to avoid shooting accidents, some officers said. They said that in some cases commanders have to prompt soldiers to put on their masks by hurling tear gas cannisters near them. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s is concerned that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have the capabilities of carrying out chemical attacks, said Lt. Col. Y., another senior commander at the base. `` We know that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries are investing a great deal in creating chemical weapons,'' Lt. Col Y said. `` We do n't ask questions, we just prepare.'' He said the army plans to distribute gas masks to civilians in two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> towns later this month as part of a civil defense drill. The officers also showed reporters an array of equipment to handle a chemical attack, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Israeli-made portable gas detection machines that look like automobile batteries and a pocket calculator programmed to detect poisonous fumes. Also displayed were antidotes to chemical contamination such as white pills that look like aspirin which are taken when there is advance warning of an attack and atropine injections used after contamination.

 A Dutch woman who was shot in the arm during a bloody protest in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> and had her passport confiscated is being allowed to leave the volatile region, a <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> diplomat said today. Chinese authorities returned <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON>'s passport today, two days after confiscating it, said <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON>, adminstrative and consular attache at the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. He said he did not know when Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> would leave <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, but her original intention had been to fly to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> on Thursday. Dutch officials had been trying without success to get information on Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON>'s condition since she was shot during a nationalist demonstration in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>'s central square on Saturday. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> finally responded to his queries today. The Chinese move came after the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in The Hague urged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to return Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON>'s passport <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> said he did not know whether the Chinese had returned passports to other foreigners who also had their travel documents seized. At least four other Western travelers had their passports confiscated, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, a sociology professor from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newfoundland </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> was contacted in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> by telephone. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official media has said one Tibetan <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk was killed and 13 people injured when police fired on protesters carrying a banned <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> flag near the Jokhang Monastery in the city's central square. A West German tourist said Tuesday that he had seen the body of a child carried into a hospital near the square. He said a friend saw two children, lying dead in the market after the protest. The West German, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said Tibetans told him seven people were killed but this could not be independently confirmed. Chinese reports have not mentioned arrests but tourist contacted by telephone have reported witnessing some arrests and hearing reports of others. The arrests could also not be independently confirmed. Tibetan independence activists seek the return of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s exiled leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, and an end to 38 years of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> communist rule. Saturday's bloodshed marked the third time in 14 months that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> security forces and protesters have clashed. At total of at least 38 people were killed in violent clashes with police on Oct. 1, 1987 and March 5. In a telephone interview Tuesday, Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> said she had been examined by a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> doctor and that he had written a letter to <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities urging them to let her leave the country for treatment in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` The doctor said that if I do n't leave soon for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for therapy there will be permanent damage to my arm and to my muscles,'' she said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet scientists plan to study world environmental problems and the devastating earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> under joint agreements between researchers from the two countries. Sixteen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> earthquake experts will leave for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> in seven to 10 days, <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>. The agreements were announced after meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week and in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> this week between officials of the American academy and a 17-member delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. The Dec. 7 quake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, centered near the Soviet-Turkish border, measured 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and killed at least 55,000 people, according to Soviet officials. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet academies also will form a new joint <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION>, which will `` assess global threats to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s ecological well-being.'' Among other problems, the committee will consider warming of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s climate by the `` greenhouse effect,'' depletion of the protective ozone layer, extinction of thousands of plant and animal species, exhaustion of energy supplies and other natural resources, and widespread pollution. `` The consequences of the rapid growth of our population coupled with global economic development now pose a significant threat to our continued existence,'' the academies said in a joint statement. The Americans will visit <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> `` to improve scientific understanding of such earthquakes, engineering knowledge of the failure of structures and techniques for post-disaster assessment, and to allow early application of this knowledge to reduce the effects of such disasters in the future,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON>, president of the American academy. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team will include seismologists, architects, structural and geotechnical engineers, and experts on industrial facilities, rescue operations, emergency planning and utility lifelines, Press said in a statement. Since 1964, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> academy has organized similar teams to conduct on-site investigations of disasters, including earthquakes, in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, central <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the academy said. The committee will meet once or twice annually, with the first meeting expected during the first half of 1989 in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The group will monitor scientific and policy needs involving environmental problems, identify way to better understand complex ecological issues, emphasize subjects not receiving adequate attention, and make periodic reports to both governments.

 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has hosted Russian Orthodox clergymen and offered them assistance in hopes of capitalizing on `` glasnost'' to improve the lot of Roman Catholics in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official says. In the past month, three Russian Orthodox officials have visited the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and met with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. Two Roman Catholic church leaders from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> also visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recently, and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> newspaper devoted two full pages to an effusive report by one of them on a changed attitude to religion by the Soviet leadership. `` The greater freedom the Russian Church receives could help the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority profit from ` perestroika' and ` glasnost,''' said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official, using Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s terms for reforming society and greater openness. `` Therefore, I have realistic hope _ not a fantasy _ that the situation of the Roman Catholic church will be substantially improved in the not distant future,'' said the official, who has first-hand knowledge of the recent contacts. He spoke on condition his name not be used. In June, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> sent a top delegation to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to help the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> celebrate the 1,000 anniversary of the Christianity's arrival in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. `` If the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> gives its support -LRB- to the celebrations -RRB- it is worldwide support,'' the official said in an interview Monday. Starting in mid-November, three Russian Orthodox prelates paid separate visits to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Archbishop <PERSON> Pitirim </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Patriarchate saw the pope on Dec. 1, accompanied by an official of the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. According to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official, <PERSON> Pitirim </PERSON> asked the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s help in supplying Bibles while another churchman, Archbishop <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Zagorsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, wanted to know how the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> organizes its universities and academies Another Vatican official said such assistance in the past had been `` sporadic'' but that it has now been increased and put on a more formal basis. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s endorsement of the changed attitude was signaled by an article carried by <PERSON> L'Osservatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> daily newspaper, by Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic primate of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> wrote that he found it `` comforting'' that Soviet authorities were `` abandoning'' the Stalinist policy of persecuting the church. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s trip was followed by a visit in early December by the secretary of the Polish bishops conference, Bishop <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabrowski </PERSON>. The Baltic states are the Roman Catholic strongholds in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. At least 2 million of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million people are Roman Catholics. The senior <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official made a distinction between Roman Catholics and Ukrainian Catholics of the Eastern rite. The Ukrainian church was brutally suppressed by Soviet dictator <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who ordered it absorbed into the Russian Orthodox Church. Ukrainian clerics say an estimated 4 million Ukrainian Catholics operate an underground church that remains loyal to the pope. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official acknowledged the situation was more difficult for them because of historic antagonism between the Orthodox and Ukrainians. The Polish pontiff has often said he would like to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but only if he could visit his flock throughout the country. Last week, Italian Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> next year. That could set the stage for a historic meeting between the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and Communist party leader and discussions about a possible papal visit. The Soviet ambassador to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> paid a rare call on the pope in July and last Saturday <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> offered condolences to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the deadly earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. He also sent $ 100,000 to the Orthodox patriarch of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, Vasken I.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified she did not `` directly observe'' her former live-in lover <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> bruise their 6-year-old, illegally adopted daughter, but she assumed he had and lied to police to protect him. During her seventh and final day of testimony in <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s murder trial, <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, testified Tuesday that on the morning <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was taken unconscious from their <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment, she told detectives a playmate had hit the child in the head a few days earlier She said she also told them <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> `` fell a lot while roller skating.'' Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> admitted under cross-examination by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyer, <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, that these statements were either wholly or partly lies She said she really believed the injuries were inflicted by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> although she had not seen him hit <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> the night the prosecution says the fatal blow was struck. `` I was trying to create a cover story at the time for what <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> had done to <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>,'' she said. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, is charged with beating <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> the night of Nov. 1, 1987, causing her death three days later. The death, occurring in an affluent, well-educated household, shocked many and has become a nationwide symbol of abuse as a problem that cuts across social strata. No testimony was scheduled today. Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> told defense lawyers he wants them to file papers by Friday if they plan to request permission to submit an insanity defense. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said they would. As Tuesday wound down, Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> proceeded with redirect examination in what appeared to be an attempt to win back some of the sympathy Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> lost under <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s quiet but painstaking questioning. During his fifth and final day of cross-examining Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> asked about what she told police: `` Were those statements true when you made them?'' `` No,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> replied. `` She -LRB- <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> -RRB- said that a kid had hit her a few days before and I _ she did n't fall a lot roller skating. She was a good roller skater.'' `` So that was a lie you told?'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> asked. `` That was a lie, yes.'' As for the blow from the playmate, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said she told police the child had hit <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> `` hard'' although <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> had merely said the other child hit her. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> suggested that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was really trying to protect herself rather than <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. `` Well, had you seen <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> hit <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> on the head?'' the defense lawyer asked. `` No, I had not seen that.'' `` So who were you covering up for, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> or you?'' `` Well, any of the bruises that were on her body, I was assuming came from <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>.'' `` And yet you admit now that you do n't know if those bruises were a result of anything that <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> did, is n't that right?'' `` I did n't directly observe him do it, no.'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> has suggested that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was perhaps as guilty as <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> for failing to act for many hours as <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> lay comatose on the cold, tiled floor of their bathroom.

A blowing snow advisory was also in effect in parts of northeastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>.

The storm snarled evening rush-hour traffic in both states, and caused minor accidents in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. `` The first time it snows, people forget how to drive,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bognar </PERSON>. `` Some nitwit will be going 5 mph and another nitwit will be going 55 mph.'' Vermont got 2 to 4 inches, and snowfall was expected to accumulate to up to 6 inches in southern sections of the state today.

The low temperatures were expected to do little damage to the state's citrus crop. A vicious cold spell in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Sunday and Monday may have been responsible for the deaths of five men, at least four of whom were apparently homeless, authorities said Tuesday.

 Refused entry at five Italian ports, 89 migrant vendors from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have sailed back to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> where they started their voyage a week ago. The group of Algerians, Senegalese and Moroccans had sailed the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> for more than a week aboard the ferry Petrarca while <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> port authorities refused them permission to disembark. `` We ca n't let them disembark because they are n't in compliance with Italian immigration laws,'' <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, director of border police in the <LOCATION> Sardinian </LOCATION> port of <ORGANIZATION> Cagliari </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying by the <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stampa </ORGANIZATION>. After a second rejection Tuesday by authorities in <LOCATION> Cagliari </LOCATION>, the North Africans boarded another ferry, the <PERSON> Carducci </PERSON>, bound for this northwestern port city, where they had also been refused entry last week. Frontier police here rejected the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> a second time, saying they did n't have work permits, travel documents or means of supporting themselves. The group, which departed <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> on Dec. 7, had also been rejected in <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Olbia </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arbatax </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sardinia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Discovery of San Francisco's Chinatown's ``Birthplace''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The discovery of thousands of artifacts dating to the Gold Rush represents the `` birthplace of <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>,'' said an archaeologist. The find is the `` most significant'' discovery of Chinese material in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> since the wreck of a 16th century Spanish galleon carrying Ming Dynasty-era pottery was found at Point <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> a few years ago, <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangraw </PERSON>, the chief currator of the city's Asian Art Museum, said Tuesday. The artifacts were found during the past two weeks during excavations of a site for a 20-story bank and will be displayed at the Asian Art Museum. City law requires all construction sites to be evaluated for their archaeological value. `` I am hoping that these things will really be able to add a tangible dimension to early Chinese history in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' said urban archaeologist <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastron </PERSON>. `` They will help tell us how they lived, what they did and their relationship to other parts of the community.'' <PERSON> Pastron </PERSON> said the discovery of bottles, pottery, coins and even an opium pipe bowl, indicate the site was a store operated by Chinese merchants in 1850 and 1851. The building is assumed to have burned or exploded in one of a half-dozen fires that devastated <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> between 1849 and 1851, collapsing onto itself. `` What we have down here is a moment in time,'' <PERSON> Pastron </PERSON> said. The store represents `` literally the birthplace of <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>,'' he said. After the discovery of gold in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, Chinese came to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, then a tent city they called Gum San, or `` Big City of the <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Porch-Sitters Fined At Connecticut Inner-City Apartment Complex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal authorities have told a management company to stop fining tenants of a low-income housing project $ 25 for sitting on their front porches. The loitering ban imposed several months ago at the Winter Green Apartments was aimed at reducing drug trafficking, according to the property manager. Under the policy, tenants who were fined three times for lounging on a porch could face eviction. The fines were included in rent bills. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, housing management director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was advised last week that the charges were improper and that the company would have to reimburse tenants for any fines that were collected. `` The porch is part of the unit they are renting and there should not be an additional fee for the use of it,'' said <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>.

 Frigid, foggy weather and problems in the Soviet supply line cost rescuers vital time today in their race to supply Armenian earthquake survivors with food, medicine and shelter. All flights between <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, and the disaster area were halted by rain, snow and fog, and the forecast was worsening. The weekend is expected to bring more snow and up to 45 mph winds. About 5,400 people have been pulled from buildings wrecked in the Dec. 7 quake, which officials say killed at least 55,000 people, injured 13,000 and left 500,000 people homeless. The survivors `` are almost totally isolated in the cold,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mankikian </PERSON>, who returned to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> after visiting <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, a city that was destroyed by the quake. The communist youth newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> quoted Capt. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobylev </PERSON> as saying in one village that `` survivors are dying from cold.'' Trucks were struggling over snowy mountain passes to bring tents and blankets to survivors, racing the onset of even worse weather. At least two relief planes bound for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> plane with medical gear and a Belgian plane were held up in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> early today due to fog in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. At the airport in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, `` a huge quantity of goods desperately needed in the disaster areas has piled up,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda said. It said there was no regular supply of hot food to survivors and that there were difficulties providing tents to survivors and rescuers. Villages around <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, near the epicenter of the quake, were among the hardest-hit places. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> societies, said in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that Soviet officials had asked for tents to set up housing and emergency medical services in 48 villages. Soviet television on Tuesday night showed rows of tents near the ruins of the town of <LOCATION> Stepanavan </LOCATION>, but it said many more were needed. `` There are not enough tents,'' the commentator said. In its Tuesday editions, Pravda gave the first indications that looting and other crimes were becoming a problem in the disaster area, reporting break-in attempts at a jewelry store and apartments and the slaying of one person. It also said helmeted soldiers wearing bulletproof vests had taken up positions in the streets of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> to keep order. Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, head of earthquake relief, said on Monday that a `` special situation'' had been declared in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> to give the Soviet army power to maintain peace. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said today that Soviet rescuers had requested mass quantities of plastic sheets for use as temporary shelters. Medical experts say it is already too late to help the countless thousands of people who remain trapped under rubble and that relief efforts must focus on the hurt and homeless. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> has pledged to keep searching for survivors as long as it was possible. In <LOCATION> Nalbanb </LOCATION>, with a prequake population of 4,200 residents have already buried 2,800 of the dead. The reconstruction effort needed in areas flattened by the quake will cost an estimated $ 8 billion, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has canceled plans to send a 19-member relief team to earthquake-stricken <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> after the Soviet republic dropped its request for the rescue workers, the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today. A ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Armenian government made the request but later dropped it without giving any reason. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has donated $ 8 million to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> through the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and $ 813,000 worth of medical goods through the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the official said. A <ORGANIZATION> Turkish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government asked <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> not to send helicopters to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to help with earthquake relief efforts because of heavy air traffic in the area. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> announced on Monday that it was ready to send 20 helicopters and 12 cranes. A team from <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> traveled to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> Sunday with six trucks carrying 10,000 blankets, medical supplies and 50 tons of food.

 A black South African who was denied enrollment in school until he was 13 has been named a Rhodes scholar. <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Shongwe </PERSON>, who won the prestigious two-year scholarship at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, never graduated from high school and entered <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> without taking a college entrance exam. He graduated in 1987 as president of his class. `` The scholarship is a great honor,'' <PERSON> Shongwe </PERSON> said in an interview from <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, where he is working as a management trainee. `` I got it by working hard, and more of us have to work hard for education. We have to equip ourselves for the future.'' <PERSON> Shongwe </PERSON> was born in the South African ghetto of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. He was raised by his mother until her death when he was 10. Two years later, his grandparents moved away, leaving him alone in a hut with no electricity. He paid rent and food bills by working odd jobs. When he was finally admitted into school, he had to walk 15 miles from his home to attend a two-room school. He became the top student in his class and by age 15 learned English. In 1980 at age 17, he was adopted by an Englishman who brought him to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where he attended a private school. He was introduced to <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION>'s board of trustees who brought <PERSON> Shongwe </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION>'s attention. While at <LOCATION> Wesleyan </LOCATION>, he was captain of the soccer team. Following his graduation, <PERSON> Shongwe </PERSON> worked at the <ORGANIZATION> Riggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He is a management trainee at the <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barlow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The Rhodes scholarships were created by British philanthropist <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> in 1903 in hopes of preparing Anglo-Saxon men to lead the Western world. This year's scholarships were awarded to 32 Americans and 46 foreign students, many from former <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> colonies. <PERSON> Shongwe </PERSON> is one of a few South African blacks named <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> scholars.

<HEAD>Number Of Calls From Green River TV Show Exaggerated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A TV special on the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> serial murder case generated only a fraction of the number of tips reported by the show's organizers, police said. Organizers confused the number of telephone calls attempted with the number of calls actually received, said Lt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, spokesman for the task force investigating the deaths of up to 48 young women from 1982 to 1984. During the nationwide broadcast last week of `` Manhunt: A Chance to End the Nightmare,'' viewers were urged to phone in tips on the slayings or any other crimes. Earlier reports by the show's organizers and police said as many as 60,000 calls were made to a special phone bank staffed by investigators. But as of midnight Monday, <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said, investigators had answered no more than 7,660 calls. <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, which handled the calls, said about 86,200 calls had been attempted on the toll-free number. Most callers, however, got busy signals, did not get through because of technical problems or else apparently changed their minds and ended their calls prematurely, <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said the 7,660 calls answered by police had yielded about 3,000 credible tips on the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> murders and other crimes. The <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killer is blamed for the deaths of up to 48 women, many of them prostitutes. Forty are known dead and eight others disappeared. Despite the discrepancies reported in the number of calls, police still have their hands full. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Detective <PERSON> Myrle </PERSON> <PERSON> Carner </PERSON> said 27 investigators would work full time through the holidays sorting out the calls. `` Obviously, we kind of stepped into uncharted waters on this, but, quite frankly, it's been overwhelmingly successful,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A judge agreed that the decal on <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>'s pickup was dirty but said it simply did n't violate <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s obscene bumper sticker law. Collier County Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> on Tuesday dismissed the case, one of the first of its kind, because the sticker's language is not addressed in the law. The measure, which went into effect Oct. 1, says a sticker is obscene if it depicts explicit sexual conduct. Referring to the four-letter word on <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>'s sticker, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said the law makes no reference to `` excretory functions.'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said his ruling `` in no way declares the bumper sticker to be in good taste, socially acceptable, or unoffensive to parents who attempt to educate their children beyond four-letter words.'' The judge ruled correctly because the law `` simply does not cover this bumper sticker in the definition of what is obscene,'' said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sams </PERSON>, who never argued the constitutional issues of the case. <PERSON> Beasley </PERSON>, 25, a mechanic from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, was arrested Oct. 12 on the bumper sticker violation and numerous other traffic charges. Under the bumper sticker law, a first offense carries up to two months in jail and a $ 500 fine. Ironically, it was bumper stickers with the same language as the decal in question that state Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Banjanin </PERSON> said he had in mind when he sponsored the law. `` I think it would be good if it were appealed so that we can get a -LRB- <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on how far the law does reach,'' he said.

 A group fighting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government offered to exchange three Soviet prisoners held in a northern province for 25 rebel prisoners, a guerrilla-run news agency said today <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghous </PERSON> <PERSON> Amir </PERSON>, of the Afghan News Agency, said the three Soviet soldiers were captured about a month ago in <LOCATION> Baghlan </LOCATION> province by the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. <PERSON> Amir </PERSON>, a member of the guerrilla group, said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> agreed to the exchange but he could not say when it would take place. There was no immediate reaction from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> or in the Soviet media. Soviet officials have said 312 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers are missing in action, but Moslem guerrillas dispute the figure. A member of <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his group holds most of the Soviet POWs and has less than 50. The <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> group belongs to a loose U.S.-backed guerrilla alliance, which is based in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Guerrilla officials met with officials from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> at the end of November, reportedly to complete a prisoner-exchange deal. In early December, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> and guerrilla leaders met in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. A guerrilla spokesman, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON>, says about 15,000 rebel fighters or their sympathizers are being held in prisons in the Afghan capital. There has been no independent confirmation of that figure. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent troops and tanks into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to support <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. In April, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed documents in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreeing to withdraw its troops by Feb. 15, 1988. Soviet officials suspended the withdrawal last month after complaining that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials continue to arm the guerrillas. Nevertheless, the Soviets, who have withdrawn about half their 100,000 soldiers, said they would complete the withdrawal on schedule.

<TEXT>
 Police today detained a Swede with a history of psychiatric illness and a previous manslaugher conviction on suspicion of assassinating Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, officials and news reports said. The <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> district court named a defense lawyer for the 41-year-old suspect, a court clerk said, an indication he faced almost certain arrest after questioning in the Feb. 28, 1986 slaying. Palme, a four-term prime minister, was shot to death by a man who fled down a darkened street and escaped. Palme was walking home unguarded after seeing a late-night movie with his wife <PERSON> Lisbet </PERSON>, who was grazed by a second bullet. Prosecutor <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Helin </PERSON> was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> news agency as saying the suspect denied killing the Swedish leader. `` The man has been informed he is under suspicion for murder, something which he denies,'' <PERSON> Helin </PERSON> told the news agency. He said the unidentified suspect has not been charged. `` He's just been brought in for a routine interrogation about the Palme murder. The detention of a suspect was the first movement in the investigation after a two-year standstill and despite an $ 8 million reward offered by the government. Attorney <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Liljeros </PERSON> went to the courthouse immediately after he was named defense counsel and was not available for comment, his office said. The suspect was questioned early in the case and admitted he was close to the scene of the slaying on the night <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was shot, news reports said. He was released for lack of evidence. He came under scrutiny again during a police review and reorganization of the probe that included 17,000 tips or leads, the reports said. <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> quoted police sources as saying the man had been under surveillance as a prime suspect for several months. The reports said <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s widow would be brought in to try and identify the suspect. The reports by TT and two major tabloids, <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Expressen </ORGANIZATION>, said the suspect was from <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> and had a criminal record and a history of psychiatric problems. Swedish radio said the suspect had a previous conviction for stabbing a drug addict to death in 1970 only a few blocks away from where Palme was killed 16 years later. The Aftonbladet newspaper said he was a known underground figure who had been treated in a psychiatric ward for dangerous criminals. Only one other person has been arrested in the case since the assassination and he was released without being charged. Police have investigated dozens of theories but have failed to provide a motive. According to one theory that dominated the investigation for more than a year, the slaying was carried out by Kurdish terrorists, possibly under contract from the Iranian regime in revenge for the cutoff of illegally supplied Swedish weapons. Several government commissions have condemned the police handling of the case, beginning with the failure to seal off the area immediately after the assassination and close the nation's borders. The slaying has had political aftershocks. Former Justice Minister <PERSON> Anna-Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON>, a key figure in the governing <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, was forced to resign in June for supporting an informal investigation that bypassed official prosecutors and police.

The pilot tried to land at <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> for refueling but was unable to because of bad weather and poor visibility, and the plane was diverted south to <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Niazi </PERSON> said. `` The pilot told <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION> tower his fuel was running out.

No one was hurt, said Sgt. <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> authorities said extradition proceedings would begin immediately. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said he would fight extradition `` tooth and nail.''

A jury acquitted the two <ORGANIZATION> Tuscarora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> Oct. 14 of federal hostage-taking and firearms charges, despite their admission that they used two sawed-off shotguns to take over the newspaper office for 10 hours. During the trial, they argued they had to take over the newspaper to save their lives because of evidence they had of official corruption in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and of law enforcement involvement in drug trafficking. The siege ended after Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> agreed to form a task force to investigate their allegations.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> today announced that it gave emergency aid to at least 14.5 million people in 31 developing countries during 1988, and its director said the forecast for 1989 is bleak. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency's director, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, said this year may be remembered `` as the year of disasters.'' `` Never before in <ORGANIZATION> WFP </ORGANIZATION>'s history did we have to respond to so many sudden calamities, primarily hurricanes and typhoons but also devastating floods in all parts of the world,'' he said. The agency said the amount of emergency food aid delivered to people in 1988 is expected to surpass the 820,000 tons delivered in 1987, the largest amount previously provided in its 25-year history. It said major operations in 1988 centered on large numbers of refugees and displaced people in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. The agency said its assistance in 1988 reached 8.5 million of the world's estimated 13 million refugees. The statistics do not include assistance to victims of the Dec. 7 earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Program officials also said they do not expect the demand for emergency food aid to decline in 1989. Food pledged for 1989 already has been committed to the agency's continuing emergency situations, it said `` This past year has strained the program's resources to the limit and the forecast for 1989 is bleak,'' <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said. `` Donor governments must now realize the urgency of the situation and respond with food pledges.''

 Inquiring minds want to know: who will buy <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION>, the supermarket tabloid whose mix of celebrity gossip and reports of bizarre happenings has made it the nation's best-selling weekly? The Enquirer, which grew from a small <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> tabloid to a checkout line fixture snapped up by 4.5 million readers each week, is up for sale following the death of publisher <PERSON> Generoso </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, 61, died of a heart attack Oct. 2 The terms of <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>'s trust allow for the Enquirer and its sister tabloid, the Weekly World News, to be sold when practical, said <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Traum </PERSON>, one of three trustees for the estate. <PERSON> Traum </PERSON> would n't reveal their asking price, but <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> quoted an adviser to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> media mogul <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> as saying that the Enquirer was `` a $ 400 million newspaper.'' <PERSON> Traum </PERSON> said many people have expressed interest in the Enquirer, but no negotiations had begun by Tuesday. `` We expect that all the major -LRB- media -RRB- players will probably be involved in the selection of the final purchaser,'' he said.

 A Cuban exile charged with attempting to hijack a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> was having a hard time making ends meet here as a cook and wanted to `` run away'' to his native land, a co-worker says.

The plane carrying 128 people landed safely at <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where police convinced <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> he was in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and arrested him, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to see his estranged wife and two baby daughters, whom he was trying to support, co-worker <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` Felix could not make ends meet with the money he earned as a luncheon cook, and he was beginning to feel that he was being choked by a very short rope,'' said <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. `` The only thing <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> wanted was to run away and be with his father and his twin brother. He thought that was the solution.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> should be extradited because the flight was within <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jurisdiction during the attempted hijacking. If convicted, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> could receive up to 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who came to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, went to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to patch things up with his wife. `` I guess it just did n't work,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. `` It's so sad.''

 Ten people were arrested at a TV station in a protest against a `` Midnight Caller'' episode depicting a bisexual knowingly spreading the AIDS virus. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> drama aired Tuesday night, following script changes and several months of negotiations between the producer and a coalition of AIDS groups. `` Nobody can deny that the producers are pandering to the lowest common denominator _ they're exploiting the epidemic and the fear around the epidemic,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beswick </PERSON>, a member of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or <ORGANIZATION> ACT-UP </ORGANIZATION>. The episode prompted protests at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> affiliates in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where the program is filmed. About 250 people chanting `` Education, not sensationalism,'' demonstrated outside KRON-TV here. Ten people were arrested after going into the lobby, locking arms and refusing to leave, police said. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ACT-UP </ORGANIZATION> members demonstrated for an hour at <ORGANIZATION> KYW-TV </ORGANIZATION>.

 Three judges have asked defendants infected with the AIDS virus to enter their pleas by telephone, a precaution advocates for AIDS victims say is unnecessary and discriminatory. The <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judges said their actions were designed to safeguard their staffs from the deadly disease and did not violate defendants' rights. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gespass </PERSON>, an attorney for one of the defendants, said, `` Everyone has a right to face their accusers and the right to be present in a court to be sentenced.'' Judges <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, O.L. `` Pete'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said they simply requested that AIDS-infected defendants in at least three cases waive their right to appear in court, and all did so. The defendants feel they do n't have a choice, however, fearing they might anger the judge by refusing, <PERSON> Gespass </PERSON> said. The three defendants pleaded guilty. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said their bailiffs do n't want to handle the prisoners for fear of contracting the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said he does n't want himself or the people in his courtroom exposed to defendants with the virus. The bailiffs and the judges were concerned about a violent defendant, who could bite or bleed in a fight, <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Saag </PERSON>, an AIDS specialist at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said it is very unlikely that a person could become infected with the AIDS virus through a bite or during a fight. On April 29, <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> used a telephone hookup to listen to the guilty plea of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> on a burglary charge, said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blalock </PERSON>, the lawyer who represented <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> at the time. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> put him on probation. `` <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> told me he did n't want him in there because he had AIDS,'' <PERSON> Blalock </PERSON> said. `` What can I say? He -LRB- <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> -RRB- was out on bond; there was n't any reason he could n't be there.'' <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>, 30, said he wanted to go to court like anyone else. `` My lawyer told me to do it over the phone because he did n't want to make him -LRB- the judge -RRB- mad,'' said <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Herald </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said the main reason he asked that <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> not be brought to court `` was that my bailiffs did n't want to handle him.'' Gespass, <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>'s current attorney, has filed a petition to overturn <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>'s convictions because his client was not in court to give his plea or to be sentenced. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, a board member of the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outreach </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group that assists AIDS victims, said the judges' actions make it difficult to educate people on the facts of the disease `` If a person in authority disregards our national health officials, it makes it more difficult to convince the general public not to discriminate against AIDS patients,'' he said.

 The army today blew up the home of a Palestinian shepherd accused of killing two Israelis in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Jewish settlement leaders called on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> citizens to be quicker to use firearms in clashes with Palestinians. The army said the shepherd bludgeoned a settler to death with a rock Tuesday, then stole the dead man's rifle and killed a soldier before being shot to death by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. The violence occurred as <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> offered a new <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> peace initiative to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, rejected the offer as insufficient and dated. The settler's widow, <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> <PERSON> Pereg </PERSON>, called today for more Jewish settlements in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` We will continue to build, to bring new homes and industry here and develop the place _ that was his dream,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Pereg </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Mrs. <PERSON> Pereg </PERSON>, who has three children and is pregnant with a fourth, said: `` My children and I will continue to live here and build the place ... even if they -LRB- the Arabs -RRB- want blood.'' The army clamped a curfew on the shepherd's village of <LOCATION> Burin </LOCATION> near the religious Jewish settlement of <LOCATION> Berakha </LOCATION> and the city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> routinely demolishes the homes of suspected guerrillas. Also today, soldiers shot and wounded an 18-year-old Palestinian in the <LOCATION> Bureij </LOCATION> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the report. The incident occurred shortly after the army lifted a curfew that had confined 650,000 Gazans to their homes during <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s address. Gazans defied army orders, setting off fireworks and shouting from balconies during and after the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader's speech. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, masked youths filled the streets after the address, chanting pro-PLO slogans as they danced and waved pictures of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. The army said the Palestinian shepherd, identified by Palestinians as <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Najjar </PERSON>, 25, crushed the skull of settler <PERSON> Yaakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Pereg </PERSON> with a rock. <PERSON> Najjar </PERSON> then stole the dead settler's machine gun and shot at a passing military patrol, killing 41-year-old reserve soldier <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Herstog </PERSON>, the army said The shepherd's family had been involved in a long-running land dispute with the settlement of <LOCATION> Berakha </LOCATION>, and the clash took place on a piece of land expropriated by the Jewish settlement, Israeli radio said. Villagers from <LOCATION> Burin </LOCATION> had been fighting the expropriation in court, the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported. <PERSON> Pereg </PERSON> was in charge of supervising the disputed area and was patrolling it when the attack took place. However, army commanders said it was unclear if the land dispute was the motive for the slaying.

 The defense went on the offensive today at the divorce-fixing trial of former Miss America <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, telling jurors that the prosecution presented an `` editorialized'' version of the facts. After a daylong summation Tuesday by Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, lawyers for Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> and her two co-defendants began their closing arguments to the federal jury today. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, attorney for Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s lover, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> `` steered clear'' of discussing testimony and instead presented an `` an incomplete picture'' in its summation and an `` editorialized'' version of the facts. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> promised jurors `` I'll give you chapter and verse'' of the testimony of government witnesses. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, the city's one-time cultural affairs commissioner, is accused of trying to influence former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, who was making alimony rulings in the divorce of <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s lover. `` Their motives were greed and vengeance,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, 64, and <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, 43, once a major city sewer contractor. In exchange for the cut Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> made in <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s support payments to his estranged wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, prosecutors charge, Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> gave a $ 19,000-a-year city job to the judge's daughter, <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>. At issue, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> told the jury of six men and six women, is `` whether a city commissioner can use the public payroll as a private little kitty.'' Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> and the 75-year-old former judge are charged with conspiracy, fraud and bribe-related charges. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, who was Miss America 1945, is also charged with obstruction of justice. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of all charges. Her co-defendants could receive up to 25 years. `` Ladies and gentlemen, what did <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> think she was doing when she hired <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>?'' asked <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, his voice rising to a shout. `` She knew exactly what she was doing,'' said the prosecutor, as his voice fell to a whisper. `` She was trying to buy justice.'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> conceded that the testimony of the prosecution's star witness, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, against her mother was `` not an easy thing'' to watch. But he laid the blame on Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> for deciding `` this was the way to influence Justice <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, through her daughter.''

 An undercover drug deal ended in the slaying of a 17-year police veteran, the fifth officer to die in the bloodiest year in department history. A suspected drug dealer also was killed and two other suspects were seriously wounded in the shootout Tuesday night, police said. Officer <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON>, 43, was shot with an assault rifle, possibly an automatic weapon, as he bought cocaine in a convenience store parking lot, police said. <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON>, who joined the force in 1971 and had been a narcotics officer since 1986, died at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> from wounds to the chest, abdomen and arms, said Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>. Police said they believe the shooting erupted after the suspected dealers attempted to rob the plainclothes officer. Witnesses reported hearing up to 11 shots. <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON> was the fifth <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> officer shot to death this year. Three died in the line of duty, more than in any other year; two were killed while moonlighting on security jobs. A drug suspect, <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacomino </PERSON>, 34, died at <ORGANIZATION> Parkland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, emergency room supervisor <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. Two other suspects, <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Surez </PERSON>, 17, and <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, 19, were in critical and serious condition respectively, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. Police arrested two other suspects at a nearby apartment early today, police spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. Their names were not released. `` It is my understanding that it was a buy-bust situation _ a drug buy _ and we had more than one officer at the scene,'' said Police Chief Mack Vines. `` Instead of the drug deal reaching fruition, they were hijacked ... shots were exchanged and our officer was fatally wounded.'' Vines said other officers were in the area as backup for the planned drug bust but did not participate in the shootings. `` I heard three gunshots and then I saw a guy leaning on a Camaro. Three people were lying on the ground,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwaska </PERSON>, 32 of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` I was just passing by here when I heard the shots.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahii </PERSON>, another witness, said he heard up to 11 shots fired while he used a pay telephone near the convenience store. <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwak </PERSON>, owner of a food store across the street, said he heard the shots and then ran to door of his store to see the gunfight. `` Right up until that time, they fight each other with big guns right out on the street,'' said <PERSON> Kwak </PERSON>, 57. `` When I looked over on the street, people were running into each other and they were shooting at each other.''

 The operating rate at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities in November rose to the highest level in nine years, the government said today in a report likely to heighten concern about inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the use of industrial capacity rose 0.2 percentage points to 84.2 percent last month, the highest since 84.3 percent in November 1979. It was the seventh increase in eight months. As capacity use edges toward 85 percent, economists fear factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. But White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the figures were `` good for steady growth in the economy.'' In an accompanying report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said industrial production climbed a brisk 0.5 percent in November following an identical 0.5 percent rise in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s industrial production index now stands at 139.9 percent of its 1977 base, reflecting gains in light truck manufacturing and production of equipment for businesses. The jumps in capacity use and the production index were in line with economists' expectations. Most government statistics have portrayed a robust economy in October and November, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which has been bolstered by strong export sales caused by the lower value of the dollar, which makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more affordable on overseas markets.

 At manufacturing plants, the operating rate climbed to 84.5 percent last month, up from 84.3 percent in October. Producers of both durable goods _ `` big ticket'' items ranging from bicycles to battleships _ and non-durable goods reported higher rates. The rate at durable goods plants was 83.1 percent in November, up from 82.9 percent. Non-durable goods producers recorded a 0.1 percentage point gain to 86.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the operating rate for primary metals industries jumped to 92.4 percent, the highest since December 1978. Most of the increase was attributed to increases at steel mills. Use of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing capacity rose for the fourth consecutive month to 85.4 percent, reflecting gains in light truck production. Automobile plants, a subcategory, slipped to 76.7 percent, down from 77.0 percent. The operating rate at utilities was 81.0 percent in November, up from 80.8 percent. It had hit a peak for the year in August of 83.9 percent because of a surge in electricity use for air conditioning. In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the operating rate increased to 82.2 percent last month. It was 81.6 percent in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s production index has not declined since September 1987, a reflection of the export-driven manufacturing boom. A related surge in spending for capital equipment to expand and modernize factories has accompanied the boom. Production in the manufacturing sector rose 0.5 percent in November, following an even stronger 0.6 percent gain in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.6 million units, down slightly from October. But production of business equipment rose 0.4 percent following a flat month in October and stood 8.8 percent higher than a year ago. Output at mines, which includes oil and gas drilling, rose 0.6 percent in November after three consecutive declines. Production at utilities increased 0.4 percent, on top of a 0.6 percent jump in October. Total output at factories, mines and utilities was 5.1 percent higher than a year ago.

 A judge today set bail at $ 20,000 cash for a man accused of raping a woman at knifepoint in an area where the bodies of six victims of an apparent serial killer have been discovered. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 35, was arrested Tuesday at his home and charged with aggravated rape, kidnapping, assault and battery in a 1987 attack along Interstate 195 in <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>. Defense and prosecution attorneys stressed at a hearing before District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> today that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> should not be connected with the deaths of six women whose bodies have been found since July along highways near here. `` This is a case that involves aggravated rape, kidnapping and assault and battery. And that's all it involved,'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Veary </PERSON> said. Public Defender <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said, `` Here's a man that's presumed innocent He has been charged with only one crime. I think that to try to link that to any other events is very unfair. ... He's been charged with one crime, he's pleaded not guilty, and he should be presumed innocent.'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Veary </PERSON>, an assistant district attorney in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, declined to comment on a report by <ORGANIZATION> WBZ-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that the man was a suspect in the highway killings. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> today also quoted unidentified sources who said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was considered a suspect. `` He would go from a list of loose suspects to the top of the list,'' said a source the newspaper described as close to the investigation. `` We're not narrowing down our scope at all,'' a police source told the Standard-Times of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>. `` Anybody who is charged with something like that, of course they're suspects,'' the newspaper quoted another source as saying. `` To say he's the one, we do n't know that.'' The partially clad skeletons of the six women have been found since July in a six - to eight-mile radius along I-195 and Route 140 in <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Freetown </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> has said he believed the six killings were likely the victims of the same killer or killers and that the victims all had ties to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> neighborhood, known for prostitution and drugs. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> lived with his mother and grandmother about 10 blocks from the <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> area, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported. The television station reported that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s alleged rape victim is a former prostitute, but <PERSON> Veary </PERSON> declined to confirm or deny the report. State police dogs and a specially trained dog from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> have been searching for more victims in woods outside of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, where the bodies have been found.

 Here are economic reports released Wednesday by the federal government.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>TRADE DEFICIT:</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The trade deficit declined 3.1 percent in October from $ 10.67 billion to $ 10.35 billion. The improvement came from a 1.7 percent drop in imports, which declined to $ 38.02 billion, on a seasonally adjusted basis. That offset a 1.1 percent drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, to $ 27.67 billion. Through October, the merchandise trade deficit was at an annual rate of $ 136.1 billion, 20 percent below the record $ 170.3 billion last year. The government reported Tuesday that the deficit in the current account fell to $ 30.89 billion in the third quarter. The current account adds the value of investments and services to that of goods refleted in Wednesday's report.

<HEAD>FACTORY USE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The operating rate at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percentage point in October to 84.2 percent, its highest level in nine years. That is likely to intensify concern about inflation. As capacity use nears 85 percent economists fear factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases.

<HEAD>BUSINESS INVENTORIES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Business inventories on shelves and backlots rose a modest $ 1.2 billion, or 0.2 percent, in October to a seasonally adjusted $ 751.4 billion, while sales jumped a strong $ 6 billion, or 1.2 percent, to $ 501.5 billion. Inventory accumulation was led by a 0.6 percent increase at the manufacturing level; wholesale inventories edged up 0.3 percent, while retail inventories, which had been rising in earlier months, fell by 0.7 percent. In sales, retailers posted a strong gain of 1.6 percent while wholesalers showed a 1.9 percent increase.

 CBS today won exclusive network rights to televise major league baseball with a $ 1 billion offer that shocked <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which has prided itself on its baseball coverage since 1947. The four-year contract allows CBS to televise the World Series, the All-Star Game, the playoffs in both leagues and a 12-game regular-season package beginning in 1990, industry sources said. The network has not televised big league baseball since the mid-1960s, while <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> shared TV rights since 1975. CBS was stunned by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> last month when it lost the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> TV rights to the 1992 <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> Olympics. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won with a bid of $ 401 million, topping <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s offer by $ 40 million. Baseball is expected to award a cable package next month for between $ 75 million and $ 100 million per year. Turner Broadcasting System's <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SportsChannel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> are competing for the package. Cable is expected to show four or five games a week. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had been expected to retain the major part of baseball's network package <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had complained of heavy losses on its Monday night package and will move its games to Thursday in 1989. Thep in imports, which declined to $ 38.02 billion, on a seasonally adjusted basis. This decline offset a smaller 1.1 percent drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, which edged down to $ 27.67 billion. Even with the small setback in exports, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> overseas sales remained near record high levels. For the first 10 months of this year, export sales are running 28.3 percent above the same period in 1987. This remarkable surge in export sales has been responsible for almost half of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s overall economic growth this year as American manufacturers have hired workers and stepped up output to meet demand. Through October, the overall merchendise trade deficit has been running at an annual rate of $ 136.1 billion, 20 percent below the all-time high imbalance of $ 170.3 billion recorded last year. President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited this improvement during the presidential campaign as proof that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policies of solving the country's trade woes were working The administration launched an effort in September 1985 to drive the value of the dollar lower to make <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods more competitive on overseas markets while driving up the price of imports. The effort took far longer to bear fruit than many had expected and has to this day failed to halt the steady increase in imports, which are running 8.3 percent higher so far this year over 1987. The $ 10.35 billion October deficit was the lowest since a $ 9.47 billion July imbalance. That had been the smallest deficit since December 1984. The trade report, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said, was `` good news on which to close out 1988. He added that the deficit was now falling `` at a satisfactory pace.'' Today's good news on trade followed a report Tuesday showing that the deficit in the broadest measure of trade, the current account, fell to $ 30.89 billion in the July-September quarter, the lowest level in three years. The current account method adds the value of investments and services to the value of goods reflected in today's report. Many economists are worried that despite the dramatic declines in the trade deficit this year, the improvement is in danger of stalling next year, a development that could push the country into a recession. Some economists contend that the dollar must fall further to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods even more competitive and dampen Americans' appetite for imports. Other analysts are urging the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrative to waste no time in launching an aggressive effort to open more foreign markets to American products. The October report is likely to provide ammunition to these critics because of a 34.1 percent jump in the trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The trade imbalance with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the largest with any country, surged to $ 5.5 billion in October, the highest it has been in a year. The deficit with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> was unchanged at $ 1.4 billion while the deficit with <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> rose to $ 1.1 billion, $ 200 million higher than in October. The deficits with individual countries are not adjusted to take into account normal monthly variations in trade flows. Before the seasonal adjustment, the overall deficit would have been $ 11.75 billion, reflecting the fact that October is a big import month as retailers stock up for the Christmas season.

 Gov. Rose Mofford has mailed 5,000 holiday cards depicting herself as a saucy Goddess of Liberty, the winged statue atop the Capitol dome. The card features a smiling caricature of the 65-year-old beehive-coiffed Democrat poking a bare leg from a white Roman toga slit up the side. `` Rose liked it. I showed a little knee,'' said <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> artist who has been designing Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s cards for 10 years and said did the latest one as a favor to her. `` She's a sexy lady.

The message inside the card reads: `` Seasons greetings, and my heartfelt thanks for your help and trust in this my first year as governor of the great state of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.'' The cards were sent to `` everyone on her massive Rolodex,'' as well as to the state's newspapers and nation's governors, said spokesman <PERSON> Vada </PERSON> <PERSON> Manager </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> paid for the cards, which required 35 cents postage, Manager said.

 A woman faces 20 years in prison for force-feeding her 4-year-old daughter a fatal dose of salt as punishment for stealing sugar. Charges against the woman's husband, who also was accused of murder, were dismissed by the judge Tuesday. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> is going to have to live with his conscience,'' <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkart </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> was convicted of murder in the May 17 death of <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>, who suffered heart failure caused by the salt. <PERSON> Burkart </PERSON> said he probably will seek the maximum prison term at sentencing in February. Mrs. <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>, 36, hoped to give her daughter a bad taste to stop her from eating sugar and gave the 26-pound child more than enough salt to kill a 170-pound adult, according to testimony. Witnesses described how a three-inch lump of salt in her adoptive daughter's stomach was observed through X-rays to be shrinking as the salt dissolved into her comatose body and her heart failed. `` There's no indication she intended to hurt that child,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>. `` We're dealing with table salt. We're dealing with a substance available on every table in the country. She had no idea of the lethal effect.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> entered a plea agreement that called for her to be convicted of either second-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter. After hearing the evidence, Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Trabue </PERSON> convicted Mrs. <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> of the more serious offense. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaylock </PERSON>, the father's lawyer, successfully argued that <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> had nothing to do with the crime and that he immediately took his daughter to the hospital after telephoning a poison hotline. <PERSON> Burkart </PERSON> said <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> was routinely locked in her room so she could not get out and eat large quantities of sweets.

 Ever wonder what happens to teddy bears after they stop getting hugs? Some get stuffed in attic trunks. Others simply sit in playrooms and sulk. And a goodly number get thrown away. Now, thousand of teddy bears are getting back into the snuggle business thanks to a local program that may be expanded nationwide within a year. A cleaning company has volunteered to rescue the teddy bears and other stuffed animals donated to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Firefighters Toy Program that were once considered too stained, tattered or tired to pass along to needy children for Christmas. The workers at Coit Drapery, <ORGANIZATION> Carpet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Upholstery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleaners </ORGANIZATION>, who last year volunteered to clean blankets and sleeping bags for the homeless, this year offered to clean and repair stuffed animals for needy kids. The bears and their buddies are given a stitch or two if needed, then they get scrubbed by hand. Finally, they're dried and their fur is fluffed. The result is stunning: The program, which gave away 9,500 toys last Christmas, will give away about 13,000 this year. `` We've always accepted the stuffed animals, but this is the first year we've been able to give them all out,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Teupal </PERSON>, an assistant chairperson of the campaign. She said the Coit employees' efforts `` at least trip day, although study after study has pointed out <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> flaws, little progress has been made in correcting the situation. ...

The South Korean delegation also includes three delegates from the opposition. The Dec. 29 meeting, the seventh since August, is aimed at finding measures to ease tension on the divided peninsula and issuing a joint non-agression declaration. The two sides also are to sign an agreement to pave the way for the legislatures of the two Koreas to convene for the first time since their land was divided in 1945.

<HEAD>Anti-Duck Residents Accused Of Running Down Muscovys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. AUGUSTINE BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fowl feud over the number of Muscovy ducks waddling about has turned violent, with duck haters being accused of running the birds down. `` They're using $ 20,000 cars to kill three-pound ducks,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, a member of the city's special advisory committee on ducks. `` It is beyond my comprehension that any one could so hate ducks or any animal that they would intentionally and maliciously run them down,'' she said. She said some residents have been seen driving onto lawns after the ducks, which are characterized by a large crest, red wattles, and a wheezy sound. Muscovy ducks are common in many <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> towns and cities, and have their friends and foes throughout the state. Anti-duck forces say the ducks are too aggressive, multiply too quickly, tend to get into gardens, leave droppings underfoot and in general tend to be a pain in the neck. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Augustine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which has joined police in investigating the run-downs, said that purposely running ducks over is cruelty to animals and could be a violation of state law. `` According to three reported eyewitness accounts, the drivers of various vehicles have purposely swerved their automobiles at an accelerated speed to aim their cars at ducks which would not have actually been in their path,'' she said in a recent letter to City Commissioner <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodson </PERSON>, who heads the duck committee. Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackaby </PERSON> said a flock of ducks was hit early Monday morning. According to a report filed by a resident, someone driving a blue car intentionally rammed into the ducks, killing one and injuring another. Last year, after the duck population in the <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION> neighborhood had swelled to 180, some neighbors chipped in and hired a company to catch most of the ducks and relocate them to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The duck catcher was confronted by pro-duck forces who tried to halt the project. He had to be escorted out of the area by police. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> formed the duck committee from people in the neighborhood after the issue began to dominate commission meetings. It includes pro and anti-duck forces. In April, police were called to ensure that one verbal exchange did n't lead to fisticuffs.

<TEXT>
 The wine harvest of 220 million bottles from the Champagne area promises to produce wine and champagne of `` exceptional quality'' next spring, industry officials said Wednesday. <PERSON> Viticulturalists </PERSON> says this year's harvest is `` average'' in size compared with the 264.4 million-bottle yield in 1987, in line with a production pattern where two good years are generally followed by a poor or moderate season. On the eve of the harvest, stocks stood at 712 million bottles, or more than three year's worth of sales, including a spillover of 123 million bottles from 1986 and 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Interprofessional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wines </ORGANIZATION> from Champagne said. The top quality of this year's returns had proved the merits of a newly implemented system of multiple harvesting, officials added. The wines will be excellent because the Champagne region in northern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had a week of full sun at the start of September at a crucial period in the grapes' ripening process, the committee said.

<DATELINE>SPRING HILL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Calls come in from across the country asking about the postcard campaign for the <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> boy with cancer. The problem is he does n't really exist, and those who know the details of the misguided effort are pleading for an end to the postcard frenzy. Bags and bags of postcards keep coming, and the holiday season has stirred even more interest. People hear that a boy named <PERSON> David </PERSON> would like to make the Guinness Book of World Records for receiving the most postcards, or Christmas cards, depending on the story. A Spring Hill post office box, or sometimes a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> number, is given as a mailing address. The real story is that <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Morby </PERSON> of Steely, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, has cancer, but it is in remission and his name already is listed in the 1989 Guinness Book for having the world's largest collection of postcards. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, founder of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Child's Wish Come True organization in <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, decided this summer to help with his effort. <PERSON> Aline </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, a member of the Ladies Auxiliary of the Veterans of <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> 3588 in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> latched onto the idea in August as a special project and offered her <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> address as another possibility. She says the Morbys asked that the name <PERSON> David </PERSON> be used to protect their son, a report the Morbys deny. `` We never asked anybody to use that name,'' <PERSON> Mario </PERSON>'s father, whose name is <PERSON> David </PERSON>, said from his home this week. `` We do n't even know how that got started.'' But the result has been thousands of pieces of mail addressed to `` David'' each day. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerbone </PERSON>, mail supervisor in <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that about 50,000 pieces of mail arrive each day for <PERSON> David </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> community about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, across the state in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, says she has received about 165,000 postcards, and almost 5,000 are arriving daily. Ms. <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, who runs her non-profit organization out of her <LOCATION> Hernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> home, is running out of space. `` I have a sunken living room that has 37 boxes of mail in it,'' she said Tuesday. `` I have a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> room that has 48 letter trays from the post office in it. I have a dining room table that's piled high, so the only thing I have left is my kitchen, bathroom and bedrooms.'' In July, the Morbys directed the postal service to deliver the postcards to an auction house in <LOCATION> Nottingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where the mail is sold every two months. Stamp collectors and others buy the postcards. Money from those sales is being donated to the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> received his chemotherapy treatment. His case is in remission. The auctions have raised about $ 4,000.

<HEAD>Government Media Criticizes Disturbances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state-controlled media on Wednesday harshly criticized a series of disturbances marking the seventh anniversary of martial law, but newspapers praised some Solidarity leaders for moderation. Thousands of anti-government protesters rallied in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, Wroclaw and at least three other cities to protest the military crackdown ordered Dec. 13, 1981, by Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. Television showed scenes of masked students hurling stones and radio carried the chants of protesters, saying, `` Down with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>!'' `` They hide behind the gate of the university, the traditional bastion of rationality in thought, ... where there should be no place for brutality and violence,'' the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Rzeczpospolita </ORGANIZATION> said, referring to student demonstrators who Tuesday hurled stones at police in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` The program of confrontation, street confrontation, is a lost cause,'' the newspaper said. `` Adventurous excesses ... are a proof of lack of political imagination.'' Most papers drew unfavorable comparisons between recent conciliatory statements by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and other union leaders and the antagonistic actions and the chants of the demonstrators. `` Recent events and especially <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s remarks in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> indicate that a meeting of authorities with the constructive opposition and other social forces ... is a real possibility,'' said <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s Zycie Warszawy. `` In such a situation, several thousand young people in a few Polish cities went out into the streets with stones in their hands and chants and banners saying, ` Down with the Commune.''' In a separate editorial, the paper said, `` Do they realize that by street brawls they support anti-reform forces, and to they really want to?'' The newspapers drew attention to remarks made by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> over the weekend, making the first foreign trip he has been allowed since martial law, in which <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said there were signs of positive developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but that reform must be quickened. The official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency also noted approvingly that Solidarity national spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> had condemned stone-throwing by demonstrators in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Sunday, and that the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> adviser, had asked parishioners not to behave aggressively. <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> normally are targets of government criticism.

 <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s first general strike in 54 years shut down major industries, public transportation and state offices today. Police reported sporadic violence and made at least 30 arrests. The strike `` succeeded beyond our greatest expectations,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Parra </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest which called the strike to protest government austerity measures. Socialist Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> told a news conference the strike was no reason to call elections before they are scheduled in 1990. But a government communique acknowledged the strike succeeded in much of the country. <PERSON> Parra </PERSON> estimated that 7.8 million of the 11.8 million employed Spaniards stayed off the job. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Casas </PERSON> said only 250 administrative workers showed up at their Opel plant, which employs 9,100 people in <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s three major business associations accused unions of using `` strong-armed tactics'' to force small businesses and offices to close. There were reports of sporadic violence and at least 30 arrests throughout <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, especially at outlets of the leading <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ingles </ORGANIZATION> department store, where angry picketers tried to prevent employees and shoppers entering. A store spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 90 percent of the chain's 31,000 employees showed up for work. At its main store in downtown <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, police charged photographers covering a melee, beating them over the head with clubs. Socialist leader <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Benegas </PERSON> said people joined the strike out of fear and intimidation. But <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s Socialist Mayor <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barranco </PERSON> said the government had to concede that the strike succeeded in keeping most of the city's 4 million residents at home. In small towns and large cities, local radio stations reported people stayed indoors, bars and restaurants remained shuttered and cinemas and theaters were closed in this nation of 38 million people. In an unusual joint action, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the communist-dominated Workers Commissions called the strike to protest economic policies of <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s 6-year-old government and its failure to satisfy demands for wage increases, unemployment benefits and pensions. The disputed policies have reduced inflation nine points to 5.1 percent and led to a 5 percent annual growth rate. But they have been unable to make a dent in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest unemployment rate of 18.7 percent. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> told reporters he was not considering calling early elections. Polls indicate the Socialists would win another majority if elections were held now, and <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the situation between government and unions would be `` exactly the same.'' But he repeated an offer to discuss with the unions ways to improve the economic and social situation. Union branches in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> called for a protest tonight in the country's second largest city and both unions planned to march on <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> on Friday. An October 1934 general strike was put down violently by troops led by Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> acting on orders of the ill-fated Second Republic.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Wednesday he is confident that in the coming years the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will `` forge even stronger ties and build a safer and more prosperous world.'' The White House said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made the statement to Chinese Ambassador <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> at a meeting marking the 10th anniversary of the opening of full <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic ties with the mainland government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended the meeting in the Oval Office. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> voiced his personal good wishes to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people and `` noted the historically warm feelings of Americans for the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people and the major contributions that Americans of Chinese descent have made, and continue to make, to the development of our country and the enrichment of our heritage.'' The actual 10th anniversary of full U.S.-Beijing relations is Thursday. On Dec. 15, 1978, President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> switched formal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognition of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> from the Nationalist government on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Since then, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has dealt with the rival <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> on an informal basis. Wednesday's statement came just 10 days after a meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> between the Soviet and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> foreign ministers, which attracted attention as a potential prelude to a Soviet-Chinese summit and a warming of relations between the two former communist allies. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in his statement <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recalled that the three previous American presidents `` of differing parties and viewpoints had all worked with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders to bring our nations and peoples closer together,'' and he voiced `` satisfaction in having been able to continue and expand on their efforts.'' In 1972, President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> made the opening breakthrough in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with the mainland, when he visited <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and a year later established a diplomatic liaison office there headed by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, a post subsequently held by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` looked back with pleasure on the warm hospitality he had received during his own visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1984, when he had been able to see first hand the great strides <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was making to implement reforms and better the life of its people,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The statement said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` expressed confidence that with our relationship firmly grounded on the three U.S.-China joint communiques of 1972, 1979 and 1982, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be able to work together in the years ahead to forge even stronger ties and build a safer and more prosperous world.''

 A bank officer who was reported missing a month ago after she withdrew a `` substantial amount of money'' was found, naked and hysterical, outside a closed pizza parlor early today, police said. <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Warms </PERSON> said 31-year-old <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> apparently had been held against her will. Three men were being questioned today by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and police in the woman's Nov. 14 disappearance, said <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. Restaurant employees found Ms. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> slumped at the door shortly after midnight, Warms said. The woman was taken to a hospital with a cut over an eye and bruises on her arms and was released, said <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>. `` Her emotional state is such -LRB- that -RRB- she really has n't been able to tell us anything about the last 30 days,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>'s mental state `` ranges from being very upset and emotional to withdrawn.'' Ms. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, was last seen in her car at a drive-in window of the bank, police said. Police said she wrote a check for a `` substantial amount of money.'' Earlier this week, <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> Detective <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schilling-Wallace </PERSON> theorized the woman was trying to signal bank employees she was in trouble when she wrote the check. Ms. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> asked the teller how much she could withdraw and included her driver's license for the transaction, even though she was well known by the tellers. `` There's a good possibility that someone was in the car with her, but we have n't been able to confirm that,'' Ms. <PERSON> Schilling-Wallace </PERSON> said. On Nov. 16, the woman's car was found abandoned. Authorities said that a woman Tuesday night spotted a car with a woman and three men inside and sensed something suspicious, noting down the license number and calling police. Three men at the home where the car was spotted were asked to come in for questioning, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` These three people have been totally cooperative. They volunteered to let them search the car, their house, whatever,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> praised <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Wednesday for having `` learned to say peace,'' but asked why he wore an army uniform if he really meant it. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who heads the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, deviated from the government's official response by failing to rule out the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a possible future negotiating partner. He made the remarks in a speech to the parliament in response to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s address a day earlier to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc issued an uncompromising rejection of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s peace bid, labeling the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> speech as double-talk <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, however, complimented <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> for the peace bid by saying: `` He has learned to say peace, and I welcome this. He is learning.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also called for a peace dialogue with Palestinians `` immediately and without the Jordanians, if they so decide, as long as they do n't shoot.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had called for peace talks with a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation, but <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in July ruled out such a move. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> for not doing enough to end terrorism and for wearing a military uniform at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have seen <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> hold out the olive branch while holding a pistol,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. `` Yesterday he also wore a uniform. He says he's effectively the head of a government, so what is he wearing a uniform for?'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> added: `` He said he condemns terrorism in all its forms but then leaves himself two openings, the struggle against occupation and the intefadeh.'' `` Intefadeh'' _ Arabic for uprising _ is used to describe the Palestinians' revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. More than 320 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have died in the violence. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also rejected <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s suggestion of placing <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops in the occupied territories, saying such a move would pre-empt <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to peace talks `` I would say that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s speech was, at most, a rhetorical success and, at its least, a political disappointment,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. `` What is needed are political decisions.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also reiterated the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal of a partial withdrawal from the disputed lands in exchange for peace. `` I am ready for a territorial compromise, for Palestinians to live in honor and freedom under their own administration as long as they do n't endanger Israeli security,'' he said. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> remarks were interrupted at times by members of the rival <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> shouted: `` In whose name are you speaking?'' <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> shouted at <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The Soviet government has decided to devalue the ruble by 50 percent on some foreign trade deals in 1990, and to allow Western capitalist companies to operate almost independently on Soviet soil, a newspaper said. The ruble appears to be set for a slide from $ 1.60 to 80 cents, dramatically cutting the price of Soviet goods to foreign buyers. It is the first step toward reducing the ruble's extreme over-valuation under Soviet-set exchange rates. The black market rate for the ruble is 20 cents to 25 cents. `` A lot of people have become very excited,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat who declined to be identified. But he said the communist nation reputedly has 3,000 different exchange rates depending on the product and the partner, and the Soviets have not said which will experience the full 50 percent drop. The devaluation will affect only foreign trade, not tourists and Soviet citizens, he said. The changes are designed to encourage foreign firms to build factories that will ease the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s extreme shortage of consumer goods and medical supplies, according to a policy statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> published in several economic journals in recent days. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> declined to clarify the statement, but promised a news conference with Deputy Premier <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamentsev </PERSON> at a later date. The devaluation is set for Jan. 1, 1990, according to the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>. Western economists said they were baffled by the delay, noting that it throws current trade negotiations into chaos, as foreigners would gain by waiting for the more favorable exchange rates. The newspaper termed the devaluation an interim step toward a new set of exchange rates to be installed on Jan. 1, 1991. The Western economists, who declined to be identified, said the timetable fits with Soviet plans to revamp wholesale prices, which are set by bureaucrats and have no relation to costs. Retail price reform is expected at a later date, as is a convertible ruble. The policy statement promised that foreign firms, now limited to 49 percent ownership of joint ventures, will be allowed to negotiate their stakes, and even send in their own managers to run the companies. `` It's a lot closer'' to major Western companies' desire for real control, and at least 90 percent ownership, before they invest in Soviet operations, said one <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessman in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> who asked not to be identified. `` One of the reasons they've been cool toward the joint venture law is they'd like to operate their own wholly owned subsidiaries in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It's a psychological barrier,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat, `` because you can have what you want and the managing director can be foreign.'' In addition, the joint venture will be allowed to pay for housing and other services for its foreign employees out of its ruble earnings, rather than be forced to spend additional hard currency, he said. The policy statement also promised that firms manufacturing consumer goods and medical products in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would be allowed to take part of their profits home. Companies building operations in the sparsely populated <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> would get three years of tax-free operations. However, several businessmen said the changes do n't eliminate the greatest obstacles to Western firms. `` You've got to be able to repatriate profits and guarantee a supply of materials locally,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessman said Western interest in the Soviet market is being driven more by `` the hype of perestroika and the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> persona'' than by government policy.

 American industry is using more of its capacity than at any time in nine years, the government said Wednesday, heightening concerns that the economy will overheat and inflation accelerate. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the operating rate at factories, mines and utilities was 84.2 percent last month, up from 84.0 percent in October. It was the seventh increase in eight months and the highest rate since November 1979. In a related report, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said its industrial production index in November increased by 0.5 percent for the second month in a row. It now stands at 139.9 percent of its 1977 base, reflecting gains in most sectors, particularly light truck manufacturing and production of business equipment. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the figures were `` good for steady growth in the economy.'' But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We're starting to approach levels of capacity utilization in some industries that will mean higher prices. If growth continues at this rate, we'll soon find most industries passing on higher prices and we'll see monthly increases in the inflation numbers.'' As capacity use edges toward 85 percent, economists fear factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. A separate release by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> supports the view that economic growth, after moderating in the July-September quarter, is rebounding. Business inventories rose a modest 0.2 percent in October as sales shot up 1.2 percent. Economists said the combination likely will spur an increase in orders to factories, placing greater strain on capacity. `` The balance between inventories was so good and so lean that it signals strong production in the months ahead,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment house. `` That's good for economic growth ... but it is too strong for comfort on inflation and interest rates.'' A third report, on the merchandise trade deficit for October, ran counter to the trend of the other statistics. The trade gap narrowed by 3.1 percent to $ 10.3 billion as exports fell by $ 317 million and imports dropped an even bigger $ 643 million. However, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities trader in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said improvement in the trade deficit will slow in the months ahead. He said capacity strains will make it difficult to manufacture more exports, and strong domestic demand will suck in more imports. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said a monthly improvement in the trade deficit normally would trigger a rally in financial markets, but bond and stock prices fell in early trading because the other reports heightened the fear that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will nudge interest rates higher to curb inflation. That decision could have been made Wednesday when a <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> committee finished a two-day private meeting to set monetary policy, he said. The committee does not disclose its decisions publicly. In the capacity report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the manufacturing operating rate climbed to 84.5 percent last month, up from 84.3 percent in October. Producers of both durable goods _ `` big ticket'' items ranging from bicycles to battleships _ and non-durable goods reported higher rates. The rate at durable goods plants was 83.1 percent in November, up from 82.9 percent. Non-durable goods producers recorded a 0.1 percentage point gain to 86.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the operating rate for primary metals industries jumped to 92.4 percent, the highest since December 1978. Most of the increase came at steel mills. Use of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing capacity rose for the fourth consecutive month to 85.4 percent, reflecting gains in light truck production. But automobile plants, a subcategory, slipped to 76.7 percent, down from 77.0 percent. The operating rate at utilities was 81.0 percent in November, up from 80.8 percent. It had hit a peak for the year in August of 83.9 percent because of a surge in electricity use for air conditioning. In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the operating rate increased to 82.2 percent last month. It was 81.6 percent in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s production index has not declined since September 1987. Production in the manufacturing sector rose 0.5 percent in November, following an even stronger 0.6 percent gain in October. Automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.6 million units, down slightly from October. But production of business equipment rose 0.4 percent following a flat month in October and stood 8.8 percent higher than a year ago. Output at mines and oil wells rose 0.6 percent in November after three consecutive declines. Production at utilities increased 0.4 percent, on top of a 0.6 percent jump in October. Total output at factories, mines and utilities was 5.1 percent higher than a year ago.

 A public safety inspector and seven of his deputies were questioned in the fireworks explosion that killed 68 people at a crowded street market, officials said Wednesday. Thousands of fireworks exploded Sunday in the downtown Corona Street neighborhood, causing a fire that swept through the area about a half mile from the Zocalo, or grand plaza. Police on Tuesday detained <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintanilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasquez </PERSON>, the chief public safety inspector in the district where the market is located, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Marcela </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleriga </PERSON> of the district attorney's office Seven deputy inspectors responsible for searching markets for illegal fireworks also were detained, <PERSON> Cleriga </PERSON> said. Authorities were trying to determine what charges, if any, would be filed against the eight, she said. Residents have reported the deputy inspectors accepted bribes from vendors of fireworks that were sold without the required permits, the district attorney's office said. <PERSON> Quintanilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasquez </PERSON> allegedly received a percentage of the money. After the blaze was extinguished, city officials carted away thousands of unexploded fireworks from stalls and a pedestrian underpass adjacent to Corona Street. Angry residents on Monday led Mayor <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> to stalls they said contained crates of unexploded fireworks. The mayor announced a citywide ban on the sale and use of fireworks. Officials said it appeared that none of the Corona Street fireworks vendors had permits to sell them.

 Hundreds of mourners, many armed with M-16 rifles, marched through this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement Wednesday to bury a Jewish settler bludgeoned to death by a Palestinian shepherd. The army blew up the shepherd's home in the nearby Arab village of <LOCATION> Burin </LOCATION> after ordering his family to evacuate immediately, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The radio broadcast the sound of the dynamite charges exploding, punctuated by the screams of family members. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> routinely demolishes homes of Palestinians suspected of anti-Israeli activities. Also Wednesday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> deported three Palestinians into southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley. An army spokesman said the expulsions were not directly related to the year-long Palestinian uprising because the men's offenses predated the unrest. The spokesman said two of the Arabs asked to be deported rather than continue serving lengthy prison sentences for terrorist activities. The third, he said, infiltrated illegally from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in 1969. Thirty-three Palestinians have been deported for alleged anti-Israeli activities since the rebellion began. Another 27 are under deportation orders. Elsewhere in the occupied territories, troops shot and wounded five Palestinians. Among them were a 14-year-old boy shot in the right thigh and a 15-year-old boy hit in the shoulder. Also Wednesday, a military court sentenced four <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to three years imprisonment for their part in a stone-throwing melee in which a teen-age Israeli girl was killed in April. A Jewish settler guard opened fire wildly, killing the girl and two Palestinian villagers, after he was hit with a stone during a riot in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>. The Palestinian shepherd, identified as <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Najjar </PERSON>, 25, crushed the skull of settler <PERSON> Yaakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Pereg </PERSON> with a rock on Tuesday. Then he seized <PERSON> Pereg </PERSON>'s rifle and killed a 41-year-old reserve soldier and slightly wounded two others before troops shot him to death. The deaths raised to 13 the number of Israelis killed in the Arab revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. At least 323 Palestinians have died. The procession to <PERSON> Pereg </PERSON>'s windswept burial plot was interrupted Wednesday by mourners shouting insults at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> commander Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> is a bad general. He does n't do anything to protect us. The army is only concerned with politics and not defense,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Horin </PERSON> of Nov, a collective farm in the Israeli-annexed <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. Busloads of Israelis, many carrying weapons and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags, attended the two-hour ceremony conducted under a steady rain. `` A politicians' army means insecurity for settlements,'' read one sign carried in the procession. <PERSON> Pereg </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Leah </PERSON>, who is pregnant with the couple's fourth child, said she and her family would never leave the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` If they want us to build it with blood we will. We will not leave this place,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Pereg </PERSON> said. Also Wednesday, settlement leaders met Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to demand that Arab stone-throwers be deported. `` Every time Jewish blood is spilled the Arab must immediately be expelled from the land. It will teach Arabs not to lift up their hands to Jews,'' <PERSON> Berakha </PERSON> security chief <PERSON> Itzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamin </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>.

 Scrooges in <LOCATION> Chautauqua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are about to be visited by a modern day recreation of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' Spirit of Christmas. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, county commissioner of social services, has compiled the names of 1,000 people who owe a total of $ 5.7 million in overdue payments for child and family support. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s `` SCROOGE'' list _ Support Children, Remember Obligations, Or Get Embarrassed _ will appear Dec. 20 in full page advertisements in the county's two daily newspapers. `` It just made so much sense when you think about the story of <PERSON> Scrooge </PERSON> and how in the end, he realized what he was doing and turned out to be the good guy,'' <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said. `` We are hoping that will happen to a lot of these people.'' The penny-pinching <PERSON> Ebenezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Scrooge </PERSON> finally got the Christmas spirit in `` A Christmas Carol'' and helped <PERSON> Tiny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> and his family. Reaction from some of the delinquent parents, who have been warned in a series of letters, ranged from anger to threats of lawsuits, <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said. `` Its rather amazing to me that a man who ca n't pay his child support can afford to hire a lawyer to sue me,'' he said. The pay or publicity tactic has social service commissioners in other counties waiting expectantly, he said. `` We've had many inquires from other commissioners, and some of them have already committed themselves to doing the same thing next year.'' <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> of Women for Child Support, said the idea was `` terrific.'' `` It can take years to get a non-custodial parent to make support payments, and if a woman decides to resort to a request for incarceration for the delinquent father, it can take two to three years before a hearing officer will even make a recommendation for incarceration,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said the plan was conceived a year ago after he noticed that overdue payments were increasing each year. The idea to print the names was an offshoot of the county's practice of publishing names of delinquent property taxpayers and the idea of SCROOGE popped up with a Christmas target date, he said

 Business inventories in October climbed at the slowest rate in five months, while sales surged a strong 1.2 percent, the government said Wednesday in a report suggesting robust economic growth. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said inventories held on shelves and backlots rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 751.4 billion, while sales jumped to $ 501.5 billion. Economists said the combination of a modest increase in inventories and brisk sales is a sign of economic strength and, possibly, inflation. With fewer goods in reserve relative to sales, retailers feel compelled to place more orders, possibly overburdening factories, leading to shortages and higher prices, they said. `` It looks as though we're getting a tendency for sales to get so strong that they're pulling down inventories,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities trader in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` That will lead to an even stronger pickup in orders to manufacturers. It reinforces the acceleration of the economy in the months ahead.'' The modest October inventory increase followed increases of 0.9 percent in September and 1.1 percent in August. Those jumps had led some economists to believe the pace of economic growth was slowing. `` It looks like full speed ahead,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` There had been some concern that the economy was weakening in the third quarter, but recent numbers suggest it is accelerating in the fourth quarter. ... Growth prospects are strong for at least the first half of next year.'' Inventory accumulation in October was led by a 0.6 percent increase at the manufacturing level, where sales were the weakest. Wholesale inventories edged up 0.3 percent. Retail inventories, which had been rising in earlier months, fell by 0.7 percent. If not for a big 2.2 percent drop in auto dealers' inventories, retail backlogs would have been down only 0.1 percent In sales, retailers posted a strong gain of 1.6 percent, while wholesalers showed a 1.9 percent increase. Sales from factories were up a moderate 0.5 percent, but they have been generally strong all year because of an export-driven manufacturing boom. An advance estimate of retail sales for November, released earlier this week, showed a 1.1 percent gain, evidence that retail inventories will continue to decline as goods are sold during the holiday shopping season. The combination of a small increase in inventories and a big jump in sales held the inventory-to-sales ratio to 1.50 in October, down from 1.51 a month earlier. That means it would take 1.50 months to exhaust inventories at the October sales rate. The ratio was also 1.50 from June through August.

The three countries will sign a final treaty in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Dec. 22, concluding years of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediation in the region. The accords, also supported by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, call for an end to 73 years of South African control over <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colony. They also will end 22 years of <PERSON> bush </PERSON> warfare in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and will bar Cuban and South African forces from participating in the 13-year-old civil war between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s pro-Soviet government and U.S.-backed rebels. South African Foreign Minister R.F. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the peace moves also included a separate understanding between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. He said the details would become known as the regional accords became effective. In <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has `` committed itself to ending aid'' to guerrillas battling <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON> <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON> provided no details of his claim at a news conference Tuesday night, and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s office did not confirm it. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Franca </PERSON>, said `` the historic <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> protocol ... will inaugurate a new era of peace in southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, a statement by Angolan guerrillas called the agreement `` historic'' but said Angolans will not have peace until the Angolan government negotiates with the guerrillas. The National Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> said without direct negotiations with the government, `` our people will not benefit from the present historic <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> accords.'' The South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> called the agreement a diplomatic feat and said the accord justifies <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s insistence that a regional settlement depended on linking the independence of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal from neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> Business Day, an independent daily, said the settlement offered <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> the prospect of `` a reduced military and financial burden and reduced international pressure.'' However, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s pro-government daily The Citizen said: `` <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was virtually an integral part of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> ... Now this connection is to be severed.'' In <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, the territorial capital, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> welcomed the agreement. Chief Secretary <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Waal </PERSON> said he hoped nothing would bar `` a peaceful and meaningful independence.'' The 10-party alliance of economic and political moderates appears the main opponent in South-West African elections to the South-West African Peoples Organization nationalist movement. The nationalist movement is favored to win.

<TEXT>
 A 17-year-old traffic offender sent to jail for earning poor grades was released early by the sentencing judge, who said he was moved partially by the harshness of the county jail. <ORGANIZATION> Hammond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Katic </PERSON> has been criticized by a juvenile court watchdog group for sending teen-age traffic offenders to jail with adult criminals, rather than to a youth center. He started his practice of ordering teen-age traffic offenders to make decent grades _ C or better _ or go to jail more than a year ago. Under the terms of the youth's sentence, he was to serve 60 days. <PERSON> Katic </PERSON> on Tuesday ordered him released immediately, after 20 days, partly because of harsh conditions at the jail, including a lack of bedding. The judge said the teen-ager had served an adequate length of time and cited a precedent of `` two days of good time for each day served.'' The now freed <ORGANIZATION> Hammond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> student had been convicted of driving without a license, with expired plates and false registration papers. Police had stopped him driving his father's unregistered, uninsured vehicle He previously served one week, his spring vacation, in jail, but was ordered back to jail when he did poorly in a recent grading period. He spent the days in a cell with no windows, bedding or books. An attorney general's opinion states that even 18-year-old traffic offenders can be sent to juvenile centers if there is room. However, <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Mears </PERSON> has refused to house <PERSON> Katic </PERSON>'s student-offenders because, she says, state law forbids housing people convicted in adult court with offenders convicted in juvenile court. <PERSON> Katic </PERSON> defends his practice of good grades or jail, saying 86 of the 111 students who've appeared before him have gotten sufficient grades since.

 After 22 years of Army service, Sgt. <PERSON> Greenberry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> retired and waited for his pension checks. And waited. Finally, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> received a check for $ 104,805.22 Tuesday, representing 18 years of retroactive retirement pay plus interest. `` They claimed they lost my records or they burned up _ for at least 16 years,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 58, said. `` The first check should have come in in October of 1970. A fire in his <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> apartment destroyed <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s own records, and a fire in July 1973 at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> apparently destroyed part of his government records. After returning to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> from an off-shore job in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> sought the assistance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, R-Miss., in 1986 to recover the money he felt was owed him `` I said, ` I've got to have some help from somewhere.' And it was n't even within 30 days that -LRB- the senator's office -RRB- had part of my records,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said. Even then, it took awhile to get the settlement from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said. `` Some people did n't even believe he was entitled to it,'' the senator said. `` But the story he told us had a ring of truth to it. `` It was two years of hard work that led to the discovery of the files. It seemed to us that it was a long time,'' he said. <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>'s staff assistant, <PERSON> Nehemiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Flowers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, searched `` in basements after work and after midnight'' until he located part of <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s missing records. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who served in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said he was afraid his records had been mislaid or accidentally thrown away when he left <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, in 1970. He had to attend a hearing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and answer questions as part of the interrogation into his past. `` I'm just happy everything's come out on my behalf,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said, beaming, moments before accepting the check. In addition to the back pay plus interest, he has begun receiving his monthly pension of about $ 765. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who is not married and has no children, does n't expect the lump sum to change his life much. He'll keep his job in a print shop, `` but I will be buying a home or trailer and getting my little self settled down,'' he said. `` I already know where $ 17,000 is going because I already have the automobile. It's right outside,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Developers of a biological product that would enable corn to grow its own pesticide say they will seek permission from federal authorities to test the product in four states. The bioinsecticide was developed by <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and is aimed at controlling the European corn borer, a pest estimated to cause more than $ 400 million damage to the nation's corn crop, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, the company's president and chief executive officer. A first round of tests was conducted in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> this year and Crop Genetics plans to ask the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> next week for approval to conduct tests in 1989, he said. Testing will be done on 12 acres of land, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> approval, which could take up to three months, is necessary each time a test is planned, said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heier </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In addition to fighting the European corn borer, the bioinsecticide also works against the Southwestern corn borer, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. DeKalb-Pfizer Genetics, a division of <ORGANIZATION> DeKalb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> has signed a contract with the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> firm to help test, develop and market the product, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> DeKalb-Pfizer </PERSON>. `` If this product works as well as the folks at <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> think it will, it will be a major breakthrough in crop protection against corn bores,'' <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said. `` Corn borers are the No. 1 pest in the country's No. 1 crop,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. `` They have a laboratory technique to impregnate the seed with this vaccine and they've done it on a laboratory scale,'' <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said. `` We're working to try to develop the technology to do this on a commercial basis.'' <PERSON> DeKalb-Pfizer </PERSON> plans to test the bioinsecticide on land it owns in <LOCATION> Illiopolis </LOCATION> in central Illinois, <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> also plans to test the bioinsecticide in <LOCATION> Stanton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, in <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Ingleside </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the company's general counsel. To make the bioinsecticide, Crop Genetics scientists took a gene from a single-cell soil bacterium that produces a protein and spliced it into endophytes, microorganisms that live in plants, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. When the borer eats the plant the protein becomes toxic and destroys the insect's stomach. `` It gives the insects permanent ulcers,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> tests showed the microorganism could not live outside the corn plant, did not remain in the crop residue or soil and posed no risk to humans, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today named Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> to be his agriculture secretary, the latest in a long line of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials appointed to high-level jobs in the incoming <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, 58, `` knows farm policy domestically. He knows it internationally.'' At a personnel announcement that turned into a free-wheeling news conference, the president-elect also hailed anew Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plans to demobilize 500,000 troops, but said neither he nor aides had yet had time to study the implications of the move. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there was `` no way'' the new administration would have a `` detailed point-by-point program on arms talks'' by mid-February, when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has proposed a resumption in arms talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We are going to start working vigorously and I will send whatever signal it takes'' to convey that message, the president-elect said. `` I am interested in progress but I want it to be prudent. I want whatever steps we take to be lasting.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said there was `` some movement there'' toward moderation in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liberation </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Organization </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s speech this week, but `` not enough'' to warrant direct dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said he wants `` clear, unmistakeable, unambiguous'' declarations that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> renounces terrorism, recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and will work within key <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions. On other issues, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ Spoke highly of former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, long rumored to be his top choice for <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary Tower's appointment has been hanging for several days pending completion of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check, and the president-elect said he had no doubt the former lawmaker could do an excellent job `` if I decide to go that route.'' _ Sidestepped questions about funding for cleaning up troubles <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons productions plants, saying he did n't know where the money would come from. _ Said he had n't yet addressed the problem of homelessness with budget advisers. _ Said he would submit ethics legislation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` very very early'' in his administration. _ Said Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would be a `` key player'' in national security affairs if he wants to be, and said there may be specific assignments in other areas. He seemed to rule out naming <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as the new drug czar in view of legislation that requires a full-time appointee to that post. The president-elect said he would not propose any substantial cuts in existing farm programs, although he did n't say what he meant by substantial. He added, `` I do not believe we will balance the budget eventually on the backs of the farmers.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s appointment was solo _ even though transition sources have said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to appoint <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> transit official <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> as the secretary of transportation. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s appointment marked a turnabout from eight years ago. Then, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> passed over him in choosing his original Cabinet. This time, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> wanted to leave government at the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, but said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was one of the few people who could persuade him to change his mind. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s latest holdover from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. Other veterans include <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, former treasury secretary, named secretary of state; <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, picked to stay as treasury secretary; <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, to stay as attorney general; <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, to stay as education secretary. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> will stay as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> will remain as <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Officials say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hopes to round out his Cabinet by Christmas. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, 58, a former <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> farmer, was chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, and served in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and as deputy trade representative in the administration of President Ford. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has represented the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at international trade negotiations since July 1985, and has been point man for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's so-far unsuccessful effort to abolish all farm subsidies by foreign governments. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged to continue that effort, and called for a thorough reform of international agriculture provisions by 1990. Earlier today, transition co-director <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into Tower's background should be finished by the end of the week. Tower, the leading contender for the post, met today with <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the transition's legal counsel, to go over some of the findings of the background check, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have suggested the long process of checking out Tower would weaken him politically if and when he is chosen. But <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said he thought Tower would be strengthened by the process because <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents have left no stone unturned. In another development, sources said <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> oil and gas executive <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and had met with top transition officials concerning the search for an Interior Secretary. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> is a former speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, and while his background as an oil industry executive would almost certainly spark controversy from environmental groups, he is among a handful of candidates with the backing of Western state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators who met last week to discuss the subject. Sources said others acceptable to the group include <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, a former national <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman, retired <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Vucanovich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. She appears out of the running following <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision not to name any incumbent member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to his Cabinet. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Tuesday, although his wife, <PERSON> Sue </PERSON>, said, `` I assume he probably will be'' given the transportation job. `` But I do n't think it's been totally confirmed with him yet,'' she said. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, 50, has served since 1984 as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest mass transportation system A former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> campaign director, a post he also held in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s failed 1980 presidential bid. For energy secretary, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said Tuesday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> team was `` looking for somebody who has got the technical, scientific and management background'' to deal with problems of nuclear safety and waste storage. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> are still strong contenders, he said. A black educator, Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, is a strong candidate for secretary of health and human services, said <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. Other people <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said are still in contention for various positions are Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a former presidential candidate who did not seek re-election this fall, and former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is considered a contender for secretary of housing and urban development, but <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> raised the possibility he might also be in the running for non-Cabinet jobs. <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, is on a `` short list'' for labor secretary, among other posts, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said.

Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s also delivered gifts to most of the children on the hospital's fourth floor during her two-hour visit. Many of them gave her handmade cards and signs in return. But the first lady was most moved during her visit with a 13-year-old severely injured girl who had tried to commit suicide. `` I'm happy to meet you,'' said the girl, communicating with Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in sign language as her father spelled out the words. `` Try to remember that life can be a really wonderful, beautiful, great experience. And it's only given to us once ... so get all you can out of it,'' counseled Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I understand that now,'' signed the young patient in response. `` Better late than never,'' said the first lady, grasping and rubbing the girl's hand.

 Six kidney dialysis machines were flown Wednesday to victims of the Armenian earthquake, part of the emergency airlift that is encountering little of the usual Soviet bureaucratic delays. An <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> cargo plane was packed ceiling-to-floor and wall-to-wall with the blood purification devices donated by an Armenian emigre group and two Belgian universities. Flying with the machines were four doctors specializing in kidney ailments. The international `` air bridge of life'' has brought tons of blankets, tents and medical supplies for victims of the Dec. 7 quake. Wednesday's flight, organized by the Belgian chapter of the humanitarian group Doctors without Borders, also carried other supplies, making a total weight of 33 tons. Doctors aboard the flight said hospitals in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, were still short of the dialysis machines needed to save victims with what doctors call `` crush syndrome.'' Dr. <PERSON> Gert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Verpooten </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION> sat aboard the cargo jet en route to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> reading a research paper on treating crush syndrome. When muscles are crushed such as by crumbled buildlings in an earthquake, they release toxic substances into the bloodstream that can slowly kill the victim if not removed by dialysis, <PERSON> Verpooten </PERSON> said. Crush syndrome could take many lives of Armenian earthquake victims, he said. Dialysis machines, like most modern medical equipment and drugs are in short supply in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and the country had little choice but to look abroad for help. In arranging the aid, the normally security-conscious Soviet government cut through mounds of red tape. When a disaster relief team already in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> requested more kidney dialysis machines Monday, the organization's <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> office contacted the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, notorious for delayed flights and poor service. Arrangements were completed in one day, with visas issued in hours. `` I think it's the enormity of the catastrophe,'' said <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Praet </PERSON>, the team's leader, noting that the Soviets have been very cooperative. But <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Praet </PERSON> said he was concerned the kidney dialysis machines might be damaged because they sat aboard the parked plane for hours in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in freezing weather while awaiting clearance to take off for <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. Foggy weather closed the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> airport for hours on Wednesday, but it was reopened later in the day.

 Eighteen citizen groups urged the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to develop and make public a comprehensive assessment of environmental safety at the government's beleaguered nuclear weapons production and research facilities. The groups, led by the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, released a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> urging preparation of a `` programmatic environmental impact statement'' on the entire complex, which involves 17 facilities employing some 100,000 people in 12 states. `` It is time to take the wraps off what has been in effect the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s ` stealth' program and to compel meaningful public scrutiny of its plans for the complex,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reicher </PERSON>, an attorney for the council. Another attorney for the Washington-based group, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherr </PERSON>, told a news conference that `` we have seen a pattern of mismanagement, excessive secrecy, deceit, illegality and neglect.'' He asserted that `` at the heart of this crisis lies a growing lack of public trust in our nation's nuclear weapons builders. Fundamental questions are being raised _ and rightly so _ about the capabilities and credibility of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> to manage, oversee and ensure the safety of this vast enterprise.'' A DOE spokeswoman, <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>, said the department had no immediate comment because officials had not yet seen the letter. The move came one day after the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> and two other groups filed suit to compel the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to prepare an environmental impact statement on its sprawling <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, before any of the three weapons reactors there can be restarted. <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is the only DOE facility capable of producing tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen vital to boosting the explosive yield of nuclear warheads. Because tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, it needs to be replenished regularly. The head of an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that the panel is not supporting <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>'s plan to restart one of the reactors _ called the K reactor _ at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> because of continuing safety concerns. The restart is tentatively scheduled for next summer. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, said the panel's position is stated in a letter expected to be sent to <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> later this week. `` The overall gist of the letter ... is that we're essentially declining to endorse the restart strategy. ... We think it is insufficient to be used as the basis to go ahead and restart,'' <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON> said in an interview. Problems identified by the advisory panel, he said, include the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> plan's failure to include ultrasonic testing for potentially dangerous reactor piping cracks and insufficient attention to bolstering the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors so they can better withstand earthquakes. In both instances the citizen groups demanding action by <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> invoked the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act, which requires environmental impact statements for any `` major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.'' Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in a separate letter to <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, endorsed the call for a programmatic environmental study of the weapons complex. They included Sens. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., along with Reps. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore.; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore.; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and The citizen groups, in their letter to <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, noted that `` the nuclear warhead production complex is at a major crossroads in its 40-year history.'' Activities planned by <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> include `` construction of a variety of new production facilities, major renovations across the complex, decommissioning and decontamination of scores of facilities, and cleanup of hundreds of waste sites,'' the letter said. It cited press reports that a classified <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> study expected to be sent shortly to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will propose spending $ 50 billion over the next 20 years for various renovation and upgrade programs. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, other groups joining in the letter were: Citizen Alert, <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contamination </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, Environmental Action, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, Government Accountability Project, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Palouse-Clearwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Puget Sound SANE, <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alliance </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Physicians for Social Responsibility.

<HEAD>Text of U.S. Delegate at U.N. General Assembly on Palestine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of the statement by Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s special session on Palestine on Wednesday. The search for peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> has been a constant feature of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> policy. American efforts helped bring about the disengagement of forces agreement between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. American efforts helped bring about the Camp David accords and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains an active, committed partner in the search for a comprehensive settlement achieved through negotiations. In helping willing parties negotiate their differences, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has always kept in mind a simple, but abiding reality _ namely, that no outside party can want peace more than the parties themselves want and need peace. As such, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has always opposed efforts to impose solutions from the outside, concentrating instead on eliciting movement from the parties on the critical issues involved in the negotiations. It is for these reasons that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will vote against the resolutions submitted during this debate. In seeking to advance the prospects for negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement, this year the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> advanced a set of proposals that represent the core requirements of a successful process of accommodation: _ The objective is a comprehensive settlement of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict through negotiations _ There is no substitute for direct negotiations between the parties concerned The parties to negotiations must accept to negotiate with each other. _ An international conference may be useful insofar as it helps launch and support direct negotiations, but a conference must not preempt or substitute for the direct negotiations _ The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> established the basis of the negotiating process in Resolutions 242 and 338 Each party may have other positions and preferences that it wishes to bring to negotiations, consistent with 242 and 338, but none can limit or avoid accepting 242 and 338 as the basis of negotiations. _ Negotiations must proceed in an atmosphere free of terrorism, violence and intimidation These are valuable and enduring principles that need to be at the core of efforts to resolve the dispute. Additionally there should be a period of transition between the status quo and a final settlement. This transitional period will help build confidence among the parties that negotiations work. It will give the parties time to adjust to a new situation. It will allow the parties to deal with each other differently, gradually, in light of an agreement freely negotiated. Movement toward peace starts with movement by the parties. Each side needs to adopt constructive policies aimed at realistic and pragmatic progress toward peace. For <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the choice is clear, albeit difficult. In order to achieve the security it deserves and requires, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must face up to the need for withdrawal from occupied territories and to the need to accommodate legitimate Palestinian political rights. The extent, shape and form of these issues need to be hammered out through negotiations, but they must be addressed squarely. For Palestinians, the choice is equally clear, and equally difficult. In order to achieve the legitimate political rights they deserve and require, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demands will have to accommodate the reality of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence and security needs, and they will have to commit themselves to negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. For the other Arabs, the choices are equally important. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have a conflict with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to resolve through negotiations. Their conflict will not be solved otherwise. Other Arab states can help by sending signals of acceptance and reconciliation to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. They must talk to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The absence of dialogue means continued stalemate. For outside parties, support and encouragement are the necessary elements. A role for outside parties in peace making is not a right, it must be earned. It is time for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to restore full diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It is time for the Peoples Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The parties need support to bring them together, and the international community can provide that support. These fundamental elements of a successful peace process can be encouraged through accommodations and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. This is not an easy task to accomplish. It is very difficult for the parties to overcome prejudices and blind spots about each other, it is sometimes equally difficult for the international community to lay aside political differences and expediencies and to adopt a realistic course toward a comprehensive settlement. But the international community must speak with a realistic, pragmatic voice. We must tell the parties that their dispute is resolvable. We must tell them that we are tired of this conflict and tired of their unwillingness to make fair compromises. We must tell them the time has come to agree that a negotiated settlement is required. So let us channel the energy that has gone into this debate in a positive, realistic direction. Unbalanced resolutions are not the answer. One-sided statements are not the answer. The answer is commitment to comprehensive peace. The answer is negotiations based on <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resolutions </ORGANIZATION> 242 and 338. The answer is renunciation of violence and terrorism. My government stands ready as always to assist in moving ahead in the search for peace.''

 A faked car accident nearly covered up a strangulation, say police, who now have the victim's husband in jail on first-degree murder charges. A county medical examiner originally ruled <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON>, 27, died of injuries from a Nov. 15 car accident, but the doctor said he knew a police investigation was continuing and did not authorize the hospital to release the body. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Merrimack </LOCATION>, is being held pending a preliminary hearing Friday. Police would not say Tuesday what aroused their suspicions following the late-night accident in <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>. But according to a police affidavit released earlier, tire marks contradicted <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON>'s story that he crashed after swerving to avoid a deer `` I think that without some good work by the <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> police and by Dr. -LRB- <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Fossum </PERSON>, really, it's quite possible this would not have come to light,'' Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Winer </PERSON> said Tuesday. Dr. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner who examined the body, agreed in a telephone interview Tuesday that the error would have gone undetected had it not been for a call from the <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> police reporting their suspicions. `` If the police had n't called, then I think an error would have been committed,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. `` On the other hand, the police did their job.'' The police call led to an autopsy by <PERSON> Fossum </PERSON>, the state's medical examiner and a forensic pathologist. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said he signed the certificate with the investigation in progress because he wanted the body to be released promptly if the probe yielded nothing suspicious. `` These are family tragedies, ordinarily, and there is often the impulse to try not to hold things up for the families,'' said <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. He noted that while <PERSON> Fossum </PERSON> is a forensic pathologist, the county medical examiners generally are not, serving part-time while they practice in their own specialties. `` The rest of us are volunteers, so to speak,'' he said. <PERSON> Fossum </PERSON> agreed. `` To me, every death is a murder until proved otherwise,'' he said. The other examiners are generally surgeons and `` are not trained that way.'' <PERSON> Fossum </PERSON> said he spotted pinpoint hemorrhages on the woman's face and in the whites of the eyes, a sign of asphyxiation. `` I believe he noted them, but he was n't quite sure what they meant,'' <PERSON> Fossum </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. `` Within his context, they were part of the accident. It's my job to think dirty.'' <PERSON> Fossum </PERSON>'s report said he also found bruises and what appeared to be fingernail marks on her neck.

 An unemployed welder pleaded innocent Wednesday in the knifepoint abduction and rape of a woman that took place in the same area where the bodies of six women have been discovered since July. The brief arraignment took place in a courtroom packed with spectators and reporters stirred by the possible connection between the attack and what is believed to be serial killings in the area. But authorities stressed they had not established a link. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 35, was arrested at his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> home Tuesday in an investigation triggered by a newspaper interview with his alleged victim. He was charged with aggravated rape, kidnapping, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Bail was set at $ 20,000. `` <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has been charged with three offenses and that's all he's been charged with and the investigation is ongoing,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibney </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pina </PERSON>. `` The search is still on, and investigators are still running down leads.'' <PERSON> Gibney </PERSON> said investigators have interviewed a list of suspects in connection with the deaths of six women whose partially clad remains have been found in a six - to eight-mile radius along Interstate 195 and Route 140 in <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Freetown </LOCATION> He declined Wednesday to say whether <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who officials also said has worked as a truckdriver, had been among those questioned. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> has said he believed the six killings, the oldest of which dates to the spring, were likely the victims of the same killer or killers and that the victims all had ties to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> neighborhood, known for prostitution and drugs. `` He has been charged with only one crime. I think that to try to link that to any other events is very unfair,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, the public defender representing <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> scheduled a pretrial hearing Dec. 21 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> will also appear at that time on charges of assault and battery with a deadly weapon in an `` unrelated fight,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. Records show that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a divorced father of two who lives with his mother and grandmother, was convicted in 1974 of assault and battery and in 1981 of attempted breaking and entering. Authorities arrested <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> 10 days after <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard-Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> published an interview with a woman who accused him of driving her against her will to a secluded area of <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION> and raping her at knifepoint along Interstate 195. `` <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> allegedly sought the victim out -LRB- after the interview appeared -RRB- and followed her in a van, glaring in her direction,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said in a written statement released after the arraignment. `` She was able to get the license number. He was also identified by a witness to the above event.'' The woman, reportedly a former prostitute, identified <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s photograph in a lineup on Dec. 8 She said she had not initially gone to police out of fear no one would believe her. State police dogs and a trained dog from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> continued their search Wednesday for more victims in woods outside of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, where the bodies have been found.

 Federal revenue agents said Wednesday they are giving 4,400 pounds of sugar from a moonshine raid to an orphanage, just in time for the chef to make extra holiday sweets for the children. `` It could n't be timed better,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobbs </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> and Family Services in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>. `` Normally, families do a lot of baking at Christmas time that they would n't do at any other time of the year. We'll go through this sugar rather quickly. We've been doing a lot of dreaming, figuring out what we can do with it.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> filed an order on Wednesday that will allow the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> to dispose of the Dixie Crystal sugar, along with 100 pounds of wheat bran, two pounds of yeast and 576 one-gallon jugs seized this fall in a moonshine investigation. Defendants <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dent </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Crook </PERSON> are to be tried Jan. 18 on charges of illegally running a still and possessing mash and untaxed liquor. Lawyers reached an agreement that will let the government use its sugar as evidence even though it will have been given to the orphans. The federal agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> bureau, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvey </PERSON>, said federal authorities wanted to put the sugar to use instead of letting it go to waste in a storage bin. `` What we've done in the past is dispose of it in the federal penitentiaries, but the closest one is in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Silvey </PERSON> said. `` We figured if the moonshine was in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, we could use it here. We just wanted to do something with it other than let it get hard. It would n't be fit for human consumption if it gets critters in it.'' The sugar will be turned over to orphanage workers Thursday. <PERSON> Cobbs </PERSON> said the orphanage has 72 children, with 10 to 20 expected to stay there over the holidays as the others visit relatives. As a general rule, the children have been taken from parents because of such problems as sexual abuse. `` We call them ` orphans of the living,' or ` emotional orphans,''' <PERSON> Cobbs </PERSON> said. `` For all intents and purposes, they are orphans, although they have living parents.'' The sugar, valued at about $ 1,500, will be quite a windfall for the orphanage, which has an annual food budget of $ 106,000, <PERSON> Cobbs </PERSON> said.

 A federal judge refused Wednesday to stop the city from selling a house rebuilt on property where police attacked and killed 11 members of the radical group MOVE. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District judge <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollak </PERSON> dismissed a lawsuit by <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who claimed the property still belonged to her. The row house is one of 61 rebuilt at a cost of more than $ 8 million after the city destroyed them with a bomb in a 1985 attempt to evict MOVE members from their barricaded headquarters in Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON>' house. Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON>, whose brother, MOVE founder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Africa </PERSON>, and her son, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, died with nine others in the house, went to federal court seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the city from selling the building which has been unoccupied since it was rebuilt in mid-1986. <PERSON> Pollak </PERSON>, noting Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> had accepted $ 2,000 plus $ 280 interest 13 months ago for the land her house stood on, said she waited too long to file her lawsuit. He said the statute of limitations ran out in June 1987. `` I am satisfied that the failure of a legal federal claim requires me to dismiss the entire case,'' the judge said. `` The request for a temporary restraining order falls by the wayside because there is no controversy before me.'' `` We can now proceed to sell the house which we intend to do,'' said City Solicitor <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON>. He said the case has nothing to do with whether Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> is entitled to compensation, only whether she is entitled to the house. <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON> acknowledged that Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON>' claim for compensation for the burned down building is still alive, and that she is seeking $ 30 million. `` The amount she wants is ridiculous but it will eventually be settled in court,'' he said, contending the value of the original property was around $ 25,000 even though the cost to rebuild the homes escalated to more than $ 125,000. <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON> said the judge's dismissal of Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON>' claim will calm fears of neighborhood residents who oppose return of MOVE, which kept the area in turmoil for years before the fire. `` The neighbors who had been living in mortal fear that she'd come back can now live in peace,'' <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> contended that selling the house would cause her irreparable harm and deprive her of her constitutional right to her property. MOVE was a self-styled religious organization that declined to abide by city laws, including those involving sanitation, and used threats and sometimes violence to harass neighbors. Federal and city grand juries declined to indict anyone, including Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> who ordered the bomb dropped, in the deaths of the 11 MOVE members, five of them children. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> took responsibility but insisted his action was n't criminal. Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> has branded the mayor `` a murderer'' and continues to demand that he and the former police and fire commissioners, also involved in the decision, be prosecuted.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has notified the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> it is destroying radar facilities at <LOCATION> Gomel </LOCATION> that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> violated a superpower arms control treaty, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. However, the installation at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> remains in dispute. Department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> again called for its destruction. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not reciprocate for the Soviet decision on <LOCATION> Gomel </LOCATION>. `` A violation is a violation,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> claimed in his report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week that portable equipment had been moved to the <LOCATION> Byelorussian </LOCATION> city in violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The treaty limits <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet radar on the theory a nuclear attack is less likely to be launched if devastating retaliation would follow. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said destruction of the <LOCATION> Gomel </LOCATION> radar `` when fully carried out and verified will satisfy our concerns regarding the illegal deployment of these radars.'' The Soviets informed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that destruction of the <LOCATION> Gomel </LOCATION> installation began last Friday, according to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who spoke only on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the Soviet decision underscored the importance of continuing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policy `` of firmness'' with regard to Soviet treaty violations. `` However,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` the more crucial issue of the Soviet violation at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> remains unresolved. The <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar is a significant violation of a central element of the ABM treaty, which will continue to make it impossible for the <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> to conclude any future strategic arms agreements.'' The two sides had agreed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last month to resume work on a treaty o sharply reduce long-range nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> rejected again a Soviet proposal to turn the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> installation in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> into an international space research facility. `` It would not remove the treaty-prohibited radar capability,'' he said. `` Nor would it restore the lead time'' the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration contends <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> would provide for mounting a defense against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ballistic missiles. `` What the Soviets propose would allow them to move forward with work on the illegal radar, with no guarantees that the ` international scientists' could not be expelled at a moment's notice,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said

 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman, today said he renounces terrorism and insisted that his past statements mean he recognizes the right of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to live in peace and security. His comments came at a news conference one day after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said his speech Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> did not meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for accepting the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in peace negotiations. Those conditions are explicit recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, renunciation of terrorism and agreement with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338. `` I repeat for the second time that we totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism, including individual terrorism, group and the state terrorism,'' he said of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. He said he made clear Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> accepts `` the right of all parties concerned in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> complex to exist in peace and security, and as I have mentioned including the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other neighbors.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> accepts U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which call for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawl from occupied lands and acceptance of the right of all states in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to safe and secure borders. But <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> showed impatience over a question asking him to say `` yes'' or `` no'' on whether the accepts <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` Did n't you read my statement?'' he asked. `` It's entirely clear. What do you want? Do you want me to do a strip tease? It would be unseemly.'' Earlier today, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to recognize the need to withdraw from the territories it occupies and to accommodate legitimate Palestinian political rights. The comment came in a speech by <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> that never explicitly mentioned the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. The speech reiterated longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy calling for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from occupied lands for peace with its Arab neighbors. Earlier today, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> delegate said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> remains committed to the elimination of the Jewish state and can never be a negotiating partner for it. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said there is `` no substitute for direct negotiations'' between the parties in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict and did not rule out the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as participant. Palestinians, he said, `` will have to commit themselves to negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Apparently responding to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s call for an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said such a meeting `` may be useful insofar as it helps launch and support direct negotiations'' but can not not substitute for them. `` We must tell them -LRB- the parties involved -RRB- that we are tired of this conflict and tired of their unwillingness to make fair compromises,'' he said. Before <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> spoke, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Johanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bein </PERSON>, said `` vague phraseology'' of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s declaration of statehood `` can not hide the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to the common denominator that unites all its factions: the path of rejection, violence and terror.'' Therefore, <PERSON> Bein </PERSON> said, the `` <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> can never be a negotiating partner'' with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation walked out during <PERSON> Bein </PERSON>'s speech. <PERSON> Bein </PERSON> also made no reference to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s speech, in which the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader appealed for direct, U.N.-supervised talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and presented a three-stage `` peace initiative.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other nations `` to come here, under the sponsorship of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, so that together we can forge that peace.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s peace initiative called for starting with `` a serious effort'' under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> guidance to set up an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. He proposed that `` occupied Palestinian land'' be placed under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision, with an international force deployed to protect the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and oversee withdrawal of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. He did not specify whether he was referring only to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967. But <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> upset some when he paid tribute to the yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. At least 323 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have died in the revolt. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> failed to recognize explicitly <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> precondition for recognizing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> tried through public and private diplomacy to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to renounce terrorism in all forms and expand on its declaration of independence last month by explicitly recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. On the issue of terrorism, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said: `` I, as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, hereby once more declare that I condemn terrorism in all its forms.'' But he immediately added he also was saluting `` those sitting before me who, in the days when they fought to free their countries from the yoke of colonialism, were accused of terrorism by their oppressors, and who today are the faithful leaders of their peoples.''

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nationwide strike called by communist and socialist unions paralyzed <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> on Wednesday, halting work at major industries, closing state offices and choking public transportation to a trickle. Union leaders called <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s first general strike in 54 years a `` complete success.'' Police reported sporadic violence and made at least 30 arrests. `` The government has to bow to the evidence and accept with elegance the fact that this strike has been a total success,'' said <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Saracibar </PERSON>, second in command of the socialist <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Parra </PERSON>, spokesman for the Communist-dominated Workers Commissions, said the strike succeeded `` beyond our greatest expectations.'' <PERSON> Parra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saracibar </PERSON> estimated 7.8 million of 11.8 million employed Spaniards stayed away from work to protest government austerity measures. Government spokesman <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> said the strike call had been heeded by `` a large sector of the population and has caused a significant impact on labor activity, although in varying degrees in different sectors.'' The three major business associations accused union picketers of `` strong-armed tactics'' to force small businesses and offices to close after they opened Wednesday. Socialist leader <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Benegas </PERSON> said people stayed away out of fear and intimidation. <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s Socialist Mayor <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barranco </PERSON> said people had to admit the strike succeeded in keeping most of the city's 4 million people at home. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Casas </PERSON> said only 250 administrative employees showed up at their Opel plant, which employs 9,100 in <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION>. Spanish national railways spokeswoman <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Acebes </PERSON> said 7 percent of the company's 54,000 employees showed up in accordance with minimum service agreements. In an unusual action binding them for the first time since <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> returned to democracy 11 years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the Workers Commissions called the strike to force Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' 6-year-old government to change its economic policies and meet demands for wage increases, unemployment benefits and pensions. The unions claim large groups among <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s 38 million people have not benefited from an economic boom that reversed once stagnant growth rate to 5 percent a year and dropped inflation nine points to 5.1 percent. But this has not dented <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s 18.7 percent unemployment rate, the highest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, the country's second largest city, police said some 55,000 strikes marched in festive mood Wednesday evening. Thousands of demonstrators also marched peacefully in <LOCATION> Vigo </LOCATION>, Gijon, <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oviedo </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Vitoria </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>. Unions called a similar march for Friday in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday that he would not call early elections because of the strike. General elections are due in 1990. Recent polls indicate if elections were held now, the Socialists would win another majority. Polls also indicate 45 percent of Spaniards felt the call for a general strike was justified.

 The health minister on Wednesday defended the Soviet response to the Armenian earthquake, but said specially trained emergency relief teams still must be set up to respond to future such disasters. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> needs to establish a special system of helicopters, planes, mobile hospitals and personnel, said Health Minister <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON>. Asked at a news conference about a report carried on official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> denied he had said the response to the earthquake showed the `` complete bankruptcy'' of Soviet civil defense. The official <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> weekly also sharply criticized the lack of an emergency force for dealing with disasters in the wake of the Dec. 7 Armenian earthquake that has killed at least 55,000 people It said the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant explosion and several major railroad accidents had proven the need for such a force. `` We are thankful to all who flew in from abroad to save those who were suffering in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News said. `` But we can not reconcile ourselves to the fact that our professionals did not arrive on the scene of the disaster before them.'' <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> has been a serious critic of the quality of Soviet health care, but he said medical services responded well to the emergency. The centralized Soviet system was able to quickly move doctors and nurses into place, even though there was no specially trained and ready force, he added. However, he said, `` I think we have to have a better effort of channeling our efforts in specific directions.'' Doctors conducted complicated operations in field conditions or even in the open air during the first hours after the earthquake, he said. More than 9,150 people were hospitalized, including almost 4,500 who are in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> hospitals now and 275 of the most severely injured people who have been sent to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> said 242 people had died in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> hospitals and eight others had died in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>British Asks Ireland to Review Extradition Act</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Wednesday urged the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government to review its extradition laws during a chilly meeting following <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s refusal to extradite a priest suspected of terrorism. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials said they were considering an Irish request for evidence to prosecute the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, at a non-jury trial. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, British Attorney General Sir <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayhew </PERSON> said the Irish decision not to extradite <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> on grounds he would not get a fair trial in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was `` regrettably offensive.'' The clash over <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and British anger at what some officials see as <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government reluctance to extradite <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> suspects overshadowed a regularly scheduled meeting between officials in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the top British official in the province, said after the six-hour meeting that the Irish government `` gave the undertaking that they would review the operation of the -LRB- extradition -RRB- act and we shall now be requesting them to do that.'' The meeting was called as part of a review of the operations of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gave <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> a consultative say in the British administration of Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. King dismissed speculation that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> might scrap the accord because of the present crisis, saying it was especially important as a forum for the `` sort of blunt speaking that we did have today.'' King met at Stormont Castle, his administrative headquarters, with <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> foreign minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenihan </PERSON>. Protestant politicians, long opposed to the agreement, said the <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> affair showed the accord was n't working and demanded that it be scrapped. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, 58, was arrested in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> in June with a forged passport and manuals on bomb-making. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> sent him back to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Nov. 25 after he began a hunger strike to protest being extradited to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The Belgian government said the British extradition warrants were too vague. They alleged conspiracy to murder and cause explosions, and illegal possessing explosives unlawfully and with intent to endanger life. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> has denied he was a member and fund-raiser for the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting to unite <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> with the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Irish Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> would not be extradited because British politicians and newspapers had prejudiced the court case by attacking the priest `` in intemperate language and ... extravagantly worded headlines.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Tuesday called the Irish announcement `` a great insult to all of the people of this country.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has complained that the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> has unilaterally stiffened extradition reqiuirements by stipulating approval by the attorney general, not by the courts. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> could be prosecuted in the republic under a 1976 law which allows suspects to be tried in either country for some crimes committed in the other. But he could not be tried on two of the charges, conspiracy to murder and unlawful possession of explosives. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, who is at an undisclosed place in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> with a religious order, has said if he were arraigned under this act he would start another fast. Irish Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>'s handling of the <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> affair has helped boost his popularity to a record 62 percent in an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll published Monday.

 A teen-ager convicted Wednesday of killing a state lawmaker after the legislator left a late-night poker game was described as `` a frightened young boy.'' The testimony came as a jury was meeting to decide whether 18-year-old <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> should receive the death penalty or life imprisonment after it found him guilty in the slaying and robbery of Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Telek </PERSON>, whose body was dumped on a suburban street early on May 17. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was arrested later that day driving <PERSON> Telek </PERSON>'s car. The jury reached the verdict after six hours of deliberations over two days. <PERSON> Telek </PERSON> was last seen alive in the Capitol garage by a friend who dropped him off at his car following the poker game at a fellow lawmaker's apartment, prosecutors said. The case prompted a review of security at the Capitol. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Telek </PERSON> in the head with a hammer, dumped his body in the middle of a suburban <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> street and stole about $ 100 and the lawmaker's car. Police found the hammer in <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' bedroom. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> testified he took the car from an acquaintance and found the hammer in the car. As jurors weighed whether to impose the death sentence, psychologist <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> presents a false front of bravado but `` behind that is a frightened young boy.'' He said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was isolated and rejected during his life, which included 13 or 14 stops in foster homes or detention centers. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was put in a foster-care program when he was 9, after a sibling was killed by one of his parents. After the verdict was announced, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>, left the courtroom, sobbing. `` In my heart, I know he is innocent,'' she said. `` If that man was n't a state representative, you all would n't be here. I sympathize with Mrs. <PERSON> Telek </PERSON>, but my son was not the killer.'' <PERSON> Telek </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, left the courtroom surrounded by friends and relatives and did not comment to reporters. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tem <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jubelirer </PERSON> said, `` It's certainly not a happy day. It simply highlights the tragedy of the situation, when a very decent man was brutally murdered. I'm looking forward to putting this behind us.''

Ambassador <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, the third-ranking diplomat at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opposed the draft resolution `` because it criticizes the actions of one party while ignoring the attacks and reprisals that have originated on the other side of the border. `` This resolution would deny to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> its inherent right to defend itself,'' she said. `` So long as extremist elements continue to use the area for launching hostile attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will not enjoy stability,'' Miss <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> added. Lebanese Ambassador <PERSON> Rachid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakhoury </PERSON> told the council that `` mind-boggling details about the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> attack have been revealed.'' He said Israeli forces used dogs strapped with explosives and tear gas canisters in last week's attack on guerrillas of the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist faction that opposes <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. He said that since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> attaches no importance to non-Israelis, `` how then could it be expected to give any importance or show any mercy to animals?'' Popular Front commander <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> said Friday the Israelis used the dogs to flush the guerrillas out of their underground tunnel network. The Israeli government had no comment on the Palestinian and Lebanese reports of the methods used in the raid on <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>. Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Matnai </PERSON> said his country's only motivation was `` to protect its population from repeated attacks emanating from Lebanese territory.'' The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassador alleged <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas had sent him a letter containing a bomb, but he did not say when. The resolution sponsored by the non-aligned nations drew 14 affirmative <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> votes and no abstentions, but the negative vote by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a permanent member, was sufficient to defeat it under council rules. The other permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> are the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<BYLINE>`Clouds of Steel': Monument or Monstrosity?
^By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It may be `` Clouds of Steel'' but it looks like something that fell over. No, it looks like one of those contraptions in a gravel quarry. No, it's an industrial pier. No, it's art. No, it's ... Whatever it is, the design that won a competition for a proposed multimillion-dollar West Coast Gateway monument leaves few observers undecided about whether it would be a majestic answer to the Statue of Liberty or a monstrous mishmash. The Gateway would be a scattering of structures shaped as squares, cones and rectangles, containing museums, theaters, gardens and aquariums, built over a downtown stretch of the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION> to honor the city as the nation's center of modern immigration. The design by <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and associate <PERSON> Lise </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Couture </PERSON> may be the latest rage in architecture _ deconstructivism _ or maybe not. But people know what they like and what they do n't, no matter what it's called. `` <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' answer to the Statue of Liberty ... belongs right where much of its construction material will come from: the scrap heap,'' said an editorial in the suburban <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breeze </ORGANIZATION>, Evening Outlook and News Pilot. `` Brace yourself,'' radio station <ORGANIZATION> KNX </ORGANIZATION> editorialized. `` ... Its creators call it the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>'s answer to the Statue of Liberty, a monument to immigration. <ORGANIZATION> KNX </ORGANIZATION> just calls it ugly, real ugly.''' `` It is unbelievably hideous, grotesque and monstrous,'' wrote <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillow </PERSON>. `` And it must be stopped.'' The Los Angeles Times liked the design but did n't think it should be built in the `` miserable'' four-block stretch atop the freeway. The designers `` have offered innovative concepts celebrating the ethnic diversity of the nation, the cultural roots of the community that has been enriched by that diversity, and the need to bring into the Civic Center an exciting focal point that bears witness to this heritage as well as the vitality of contemporary life,'' the Times said. `` Clouds of Steel'' was selected by a jury from 150 entries in a competition initiated by Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. The mayor has not made any comment on the choice since it was announced Dec. 6. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Patsaouras </PERSON>, chairman of the Gateway project, on Wednesday agreed that the mayor should leave such matters to his cultural affairs commissioners and he criticized two <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members who had negative reactions. `` How can you express an opinion on such a fundamental vision from a copy of a picture without seeing the model, without talking with the artist to see his vision?'' <PERSON> Patsaouras </PERSON> said. But the furor shows that people are taking it seriously and as a debate over the future of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he said. `` It's a project that entails passion. ... Every place I go people are discussing it.'' The structure would cost $ 33 million but that does not include other costs such as leasing airspace over the freeway from the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Patsaouras </PERSON> had no estimates for any of the other costs. The committee will begin seeking funding from private donors at the beginning of the new year, he said. He hopes to have plans, permits and construction on the first of four phases under way in 1 -LCB- to two years. Critics have pointedly noted that the designers are from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The suburban papers called it a `` meaningless pile of scrap'' and suggested that funding for the `` praying mantis-like monstrosity, designed by two New Yorkers'' could be better spent on housing and food for the homeless. `` This atrocity was designed by New Yorkers, approved by an elitist panel and will be financed by private donations,'' <ORGANIZATION> KNX </ORGANIZATION> said. The Gateway would contain an immigration museum, museums of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> oceans, the Park of Peace and Unity, a performance theater called The Sphinx, a restaurant in a construction called the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dipper </ORGANIZATION>, a Time Museum, sculpture garden, a Musical Forest, liquid crystal display screens called Voices of the People, a painting gallery, and a Food of the World section in an area called the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dipper </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, art critic for <ORGANIZATION> L.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION>, had a positive initial reaction but cautioned that the freeway site could hamper inevitable design changes. `` I predict the whole thing will wind up less exciting -LRB- than -RRB- it's proposed to be,'' he said. `` I think that it's a pretty exciting thing visually. I just hope it's set up at a place where traffic tends to be slow so that it does n't cause any fender benders.''

 Iranians occupied the Iranian consulate and held the consul and three other people hostage for five hours Wednesday to demand an end to alleged repression in the Islamic nation, but police stormed the building and arrested them, authorities said. A banner unfurled by the six occupiers read: `` 10 Years of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. 10 Years of Famine and Torture.'' A masked man and and another wearing a turban chanted `` Death to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>!''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> intends to return on Thursday what could be the largest single group of remains of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement, said the repatriation had been scheduled in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and would include what the Vietnamese believe were the remains of 38 individuals. The largest previous repatriation, which occurred in April, totaled 27 individuals. The Vietnamese government also claims it will have other, unspecified `` information'' to share with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about the status of 12 additional cases of missing Americans, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` Arrangements have been made to receive the remains in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and fly them to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> for subsequent evaluation in an effort to achieve individual identification,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in its statement. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government appreciates the initiative taken by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to repatriate these remains and hopes to continue the increasing cooperation to resolve this long-standing issue.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it had not received any information from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on precisely where the various remains had been recovered or the circumstances surrounding their discovery. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> added, however, that `` we understand the remains as well as the information are related to incidents that occurred -LRB- during the war -RRB- in the northern provinces.'' `` That's all we know at this point,'' the spokesman said. Currently, 2,383 Americans continue to be listed as missing in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> as a result of the Vietnam War, of whom 1,747 are listed as missing in either North or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. All told, the remains of 172 Americans have been repatriated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and subsequently identified by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> lab since the end of the war. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, in its statement Wednesday, noted the upcoming repatriation would be the seventh since a special presidential mission was undertaken by retired Army Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>. The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> at President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request in August 1987 with orders to seek greater cooperation with the Vietnamese in resolving the cases of missing Americans. In the past, remains repatriated by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> occasionally have included those of Vietnamese individuals. As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> routinely declines to predict whether all repatriated remains can be individually identified by the Army laboratory in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>.

 A 17-year-old boy was arrested after a predawn bank heist Wednesday and police said he was part of a gang that has been stealing coins from as many as 40 banks since July. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> was charged with several counts of burglary after officers found him in the vicinity of a smashed window at a <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, said Officer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Phieffer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Spurill </PERSON>, who was suspected of acting as a lookout, had $ 30 in coins in his pocket at the time of his arrest, <PERSON> Phieffer </PERSON> said. Police said two other suspects escaped. It was not known how much money in coins were taken from the bank, police said. The three are believed to belong to a gang responsible for at least 25 and as many as 40 similar heists at banks in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, head of the police-FBI <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robbery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators estimate the gang averaged $ 1,000 in coins per heist. Sometimes the burden of crime was too much for the gang to carry. `` At times they had problems getting it -LRB- the wrapped coins -RRB- out, and they would leave it on the streets,'' <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said. Investigators said the robbery spree began in July, when the gang staged three predawn bank heists in a week. `` They used a brick or a rock to smash the bank's plate glass window,'' <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said, `` a very sophisticated means of entry.'' Once the window was smashed `` they're in and out in 60 seconds,'' the sergeant said. `` They know in advance where they're going.'' The gang specialized in stealing coins because `` that's all that's in the bank at the time,'' since paper currency is usually locked in vaults overnight, <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said. The coins were in tellers' drawers that had to be jimmied open The burglars would also take portable computers off bank employee's desks if there were n't enough coins to carry, the sergeant added.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> took a cautious stance Wednesday on the possibility of a multimillion-dollar landmark home being turned over as a gift for future secretaries of state to use as their residence. `` If any such proposal were made to the department, we would need to review it in the light of applicable law and policy,'' spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cafritz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> philanthropist and socialite who died Nov. 29, had a provision in her will that her home could become the official residence of the secretary of state, but an appropriation bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, might be a barrier, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, an executor of the estate. Mrs. <PERSON> Cafritz </PERSON>, who was 78, left the house on fashionable Foxhall Road to the <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cafritz </PERSON> Foundation. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said the will was `` broad enough'' for the home to go to the secretary of state or to be used as an adjunct to <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the official residence of prominent foreign visitors, or by scholars holding seminars. Referring to the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> bill, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said by telephone from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law office, `` It could be a problem.'' He said disposition of the house was in a preliminary stage. The former secretary of state said `` nobody from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had anything to do with this. It's just what she wanted. That was one of the possibilities that she had in mind.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and his aides were out of town and could not be reached for comment. Mrs. <PERSON> Cafritz </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, died in 1964. He was a prominent builder in the period when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was in the process of changing from a small town to a high-powered city that is now one of the world's most expensive cities to live in. The <PERSON> Cafritz </PERSON> house, a 1938 Art Moderne residence, is on a seven-acre estate that is assessed for tax purposes at $ 3,567,650 by the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and could be worth considerably more. The appropriations bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last December at the urging of <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> contains a ban on honoraria for secretaries of state.

 Police arrested a suspect on Wednesday in the assassination nearly three years ago of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, and news reports described him as a convicted killer with a long criminal record. The arrest could be the first break in an investigation that has been marred by internal squabbles and prompted accusations of incompetence by parlimentary and independent commissions. No motive or solid leads emerged despite the biggest manhunt in Swedish history and an $ 8 million reward. Chief prosecutor <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Morath </PERSON> decided to have the suspect formally arrested after he was detained earlier Wednesday. He can be held for two days and then either released or formally charged. During lengthy interrogation, the suspect denied he was the person who shot <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION> on Feb. 28, 1986, while the Swedish leader and his wife were walking home from a movie without bodyguards, the prosecutor said in a statement he read on on television. He said the man under arrest is `` reasonably suspected of having committed the deed.'' Prosecutors and police refused to say why the man is suspected or answer other questions on the case Wednesday. Under Swedish regulations, a suspect can not be identified by name even after charges are filed. Newspapers described the suspect as a man of 41 with a history of violent crime, including a manslaughter conviction for stabbing a drug addict to death with a bayonet in 1970 a few blocks from where Palme was killed. State radio said he had been treated in a psychiatric ward for dangerous criminals. The national news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> reported 63 offenses on the man's record It said witnesses were expected to be summoned to confront the suspect, including <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Lisbet </PERSON>, who was grazed by a bullet in the attack. According to the media reports, the man was questioned and released earlier in the investigation and came under renewed suspicion when a new chief investigator, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Olvebro </PERSON>, took over the inquiry 13 months ago and reopened old files for review. National radio said witnesses cast doubt on the man's assertion he was in a nearby restaurant at the time of the shooting, and it quoted the witnesses as saying he left earlier. He also has a limp, which fits accounts from witnesses that the killer walked in a `` jerky'' way while following the Palmes for several blocks after they left the theater, the radio reported. It said he was detained at his home in the <LOCATION> Sollentuna </LOCATION> suburb and his house was searched. Wednesday's arrest was the first movement reported in the case since the former chief investigator, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, rounded up Kurdish exiles two years ago and accused them of being part of an international conspiracy. They were released without charges. The stalled case indirectly led to a political scandal this year when ranking government officials approved an unofficial investigation by publisher <PERSON> Ebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>. Justice Minister <PERSON> Anna-Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> was forced to resign. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, who served 11 years as prime minister in four terms, was a controversial figure deeply involved in world disarmament issues and served as a U.N.-appointed mediator in the Iran-Iraq war. He was the first Swedish leader to die violently in two centuries. His murder was a severe jolt to a nation with a tendency to see itself as immune to the terrorism, crime and assassination common in other parts of the world.

<HEAD>Justice: Federal OSHA Law Doesn't Pre-empt State Job Safety Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Employers whose workers are killed or injured on the job can be prosecuted for murder, manslaughter or assault under state laws and can not seek refuge under federal workplace safety laws, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in an opinion made public Wednesday. The department, responding to a request from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said criminal penalties in the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act do not pre-empt state and local criminal laws. `` We see nothing in the -LRB- act -RRB- or its legislative history which indicates that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended for the relatively limited criminal penalities provided by the act to deprive employees of the protection provided by state criminal laws of general applicability,'' the department said. The opinion, dated last Friday and released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel's subcommittee on employment and housing, flies in the face of several recent state court rulings throwing out criminal convictions against employers whose workers were injured through violations of federal job safety standards. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., the subcommittee's chairman, said he welcomed what he called the `` long overdue'' statement dealing with the issue `` I am pleased that <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> agrees with us and squarely rejects the position that the federal <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> law shields employers who show willful disregard for worker safety from state criminal prosecution,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said In a hearing before the subcommittee last February, prosecutors from several states testified about indictments being dismissed and convictions overturned because judges had ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> law pre-empts state prosecution. Judges in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> have ruled that federal enforcement of safety standards pre-empts state criminal prosecutions of employers. However, judges in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> have ruled just the opposite. The issue is expected to reach the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> eventually, possibly through a case now before the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In that case, <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutors won indictments on criminal charges of aggravated battery, reckless conduct and assault against <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magnet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and five of its officials for allegedly exposing workers to phosgene and other toxic gases. However, before the case went to trial, the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> dismissed the indictments as being a pre-emption of the federal <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> law.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of a statement in English by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, at the opening of a press conference Wednesday: Let me highlight my views before you. Our desire for peace is a strategy and not an interim tactic. We are bent to peace come what may. Our statehood provides salvation to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and peace to both Palestinians and Israelis. Self-determination means survival for the Palestinians. And our survival does not destroy the survival of the Israelis as their rulers claim. Yesterday in my speech I made a reference to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution 181 -LRB- on the partition of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> -RRB- as the basis for Palestinian independence. I also made a reference to our acceptance of resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> within the framework of an international conference. These three resolutions were endorsed at our <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> session in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. In my speech also yesterday it was clear that we mean our peoples' right to freedom and national independence according to resolution 181 and the right of all parties concerned in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict to exist in peace and security and as I have mentioned including the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other neighbors according to the resolution 242 and 338. As for terrorism, I renounced it yesterday in no uncertain terms and yet I repeat for the record that we totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism, including individual, group and state terrorism. Between <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> we have made our position crystal clear. Any more talk such as the Palestinians should give more _ you remember this slogan, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> should give it more _ or it is not enough, or the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are engaging in propaganda games and public relations exercise will be damaging and counterproductive. Enough is enough. Enough is enough. Enough is enough. All remaining matters should be discussed around the table and within the international conference. Let it be absolutely clear that neither <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> nor any -LRB- one else -RRB- for that matter can stop the intifadeh, the uprising. The intifadeh will come to an end only and only when practical and tangible steps have been taken towards the achievement of our national aims and the establishment of our independent Palestinian state. In this context I expect the EEC -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to play a more effective role in promoting peace in our region. They have political responsibility, they have moral responsibility and they can deal with it. Finally, I declare before you and I ask you to kindly quote me on that: We want peace. We want peace. We are committed to peace. We want to live in our <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state and let live.

 Grieving relatives of an inmate who was listed among the dead in a prison blaze were told he was alive in a hospital as they gathered at a funeral home, a newspaper reported Wednesday. The family was told <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> <PERSON> Sustaita </PERSON> was in serious condition at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The charred body in the casket mistakenly had been identified as <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> by his brother, who saw part of a tattoo on the man's chest, the daily <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> reported. Relatives took the body to a funeral home and were mourning when police informed them the 23-year-old inmate had been located at the hospital, <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The family cheered up and forgot the other body, which was returned to the morgue by the funeral home,'' the newspaper said. Three other prisoners also remain hospitalized in serious condition from Tuesday's fire, which killed 19 inmates at the Nuevo Leon state penitentiary. Authorities believe the blaze started when a candle near an altar in a prison cell set a curtain on fire. Hospital spokesman <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> and the others were in serious condition. Prisoners were allowed to set up shrines to the Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> on Monday, a holiday honoring the patron saint of this mostly Roman Catholic country. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> morgue Wednesday confirmed the death toll stood at 19, although prison officials had earlier set it at 20, including <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>. In another tragic twist, newspapers reported that <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> <PERSON> Coronado </PERSON> had been jailed on a first-offense charge of illegally carrying a weapon, a three-inch knife, less than 24 hours before he died in the fire. <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> had failed to come up with the $ 6.50 he needed for bail, the report said. Officials said 116 prisoners were in the prison dormitory when the fire broke out about 3 a.m. Tuesday. The ward was built for 70 prisoners.

 Former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> talked Wednesday with President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s legal adviser about the results of an extensive <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into his background as transition aides said the suspense over the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> post could end this week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he has n't decided whether Tower will be the new defense secretary but he was confident the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator would do an excellent job `` if I decide to go that route.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has not seen the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report. For weeks, Tower has been the rumored front-runner for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> job but the post has remained vacant while the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> completed its investigation, which includes probing allegations of womanizing and drinking that arose during Tower's 1987 divorce. Other areas of interest to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> were Tower's relationship with defense contractors he represents as a private consultant, and his use of campaign funds after he retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, the transition's co-director, said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> `` has just about concluded'' its probe. `` I would expect by the end of this week we will reach a final conclusion about whether we can go forward with a final recommendation,'' he said. Tower met with <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s legal counsel, to discuss the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s report. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said the probe has n't been concluded, but refused to say anthing further. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said he and transition co-director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> will review the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s findings this week and then provide <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a report. So far, there is nothing in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation to disqualify Tower, he said. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have said Tower's effectiveness, if he is chosen, may be crippled by the lengthy selection process. But <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> disputed that view, calling the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> check prudent. `` You have to admire Sen. Tower's willingness to go through this,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. Tower, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a one-time arms control negotiator in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, is known to want the Pentagon job, though he has not spoken out publicly since speculation about his appointment began last month. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> also dispelled any notion that Tower would be denied a hand in picking his top aides. Some reports indicated that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intended to unveil an entire team of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials at the time he named the new secretary. `` I've heard the talk about the slate, but it did n't come from me because there was never any determination made that we would present to either Sen. Tower, should he be selected, or any other Cabinet member, a complete slate of office-holders for the other positions in the department,'' he said. Several people from industry are known to have rejected overtures to serve in the No. 2 job at <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, typically a post filled by a manager. Among them are <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, the chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Augustine </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Marietta </ORGANIZATION>.

 British egg producers, whose sales have been hurt by a salmonella poisoning scare, said Wednesday they will send up to 1 million surplus eggs to victims of the Armenian earthquake. One lawmaker called the gesture a `` poison chalice,'' but the <ORGANIZATION> Egg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the eggs were safe to eat. `` We feel we are helping in some small measure people who are suffering a great deal at the moment,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, president of the association. `` We are satisfied from our own tests that these eggs contain no salmonella.'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said demand for eggs in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has dropped 30 percent to 60 percent since Health Minister <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> said earlier this month that most of the nation's eggs were tainted with salmonella. `` For us it's like the Wall Street crash,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. `` We would rather give these eggs away than dump them.'' `` We asked the Russian Embassy what they thought of the idea and they said they would welcome the eggs,'' he said. `` They are arranging for the first load to go today.'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said he has donated 10,000 eggs from his farm and said other producers would be donating a similar number. `` We are aiming to step this up and expect to send a million eggs to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> within days,'' he said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Foulkes </PERSON>, a foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` This is the poison chalice ...

 Four years after contractors began dismantling the nation's first commercial nuclear power plant, the reactor vessel was hoisted from its underground site Wednesday for a 7,800-mile journey to a federal dump. The raising of the 1,000-ton reactor pressure vessel and neutron-shield tank, packed with concrete, is the most dramatic, although not necessarily the most critical, aspect of the five-year decommissioning. The <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION> Atomic Power Station, dedicated by President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> in 1957, was retired in 1982 after generating about 6.5 billion kilowatts of electricity. Wednesday's big move was also the federal government's attempt to prove that reactors can be dismantled safely and affordably, providing a model procedure for utilities when their reactors have outlived their usefulness. `` This really has been a demonstration for all of us,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeless </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION> plant. `` You've got to take reactors from the cradle to the grave. If you ca n't handle the burial, there's some question of whether you should be handling a reactor at all.'' The plant is the largest nuclear unit and only commercial reactor in the world to be dismantled to date. Several nuclear plants have been mothballed or entombed, including Peachbottom I in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> I in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and Indian Point I in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Even perfect success for the <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION> operation wo n't solve what is one of the biggest problems facing the commercial nuclear power industry: what to do with highly radioactive waste. While waste from the federally owned <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION> plant is going to military dumps in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, there is no place to dispose of commercial high-level waste. A national repository for spent fuel, which was to open in 1998, probably wo n't be available until the next century, said <PERSON> Wheeless </PERSON>. `` This is a demonstration in terms of technology,'' she said. `` Where the fuel or the reactor pressure vessel go is not being demonstrated. That has to be solved by the commercial nuclear industry, and I think that's going to be one of the biggest issues facing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Almost all of the 12,000 metric tons of spent uranium fuel from private reactors is being stored in water-filled utility holding ponds. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear plants will reach the end of their 30 - to 40-year useful lives by the year 2000 The spent uranium fuel from the <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION> reactor was removed in 1984 and taken to a military dump in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Only low-level radiation is left in the reactor, which poses no health risk, spokesmen said. `` The radiation is trapped in the steel itself. The highly radioactive stuff is gone,'' said <PERSON> Wheeless </PERSON>. `` Unless you attach it to your body and wear it as an undergarment, there is no danger.'' `` You get more radiation flying from <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> than you would get standing next to the reactor,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, another department spokesman. Federal officials say they intend to remove all radioactive material so the <LOCATION> Shippingport </LOCATION> site, 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, can be returned to unrestricted use. The decommissioning is expected to be completed on schedule by 1990 at a cost of approximately $ 98 million. Officials estimate that at a rate of 25 feet per hour, it would take about 10 hours to lift the reactor from the containment building to a specially constructed flatbed transporter with 320 rubber tires. A special stationary crane was constructed to lift the mammoth load. The reactor is composed of a pressure vessel with 8-inch thick steel walls and an encompassing neutron shield with steel walls 1 -LCB- inches thick. Spaces within the assembly were filled with concrete to stabilize it and further reduce radioactivity. The cylindrical reactor, 41 feet long, 30 feet high and 18 feet in diameter, was lifted vertically 77 feet and was to be moved horizontally, then lowered 47 feet onto the transporter. It will be rolled to the bank of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and placed on a 200-foot-long barge in the spring and shipped via the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION>.

 Suspected anti-government militants opened fire and threw bombs at a suburban prison, freeing 221 inmates, the government said Wednesday. Guards killed two prisoners during Tuesday night's jail raid at the Welikade Prison, which prompted authorities to impose curfews in parts of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> and to appoint an army officer to oversee the country's prisons, the government said. The attack on the medium-security prison housing about 1,500 inmates was the second in as many weeks in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. On Dec. 4, suspected Sinhalese extremists dressed in army uniforms overpowered guards at a prison in central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and freed six inmates. A military spokesman who requested anonymity said Tuesday's escape apparently was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist Sinhalese group trying to topple the government and disrupt the Dec. 19 presidential elections The military official said about 25 gunmen opened fire and threw small bombs at the south wall of the prison. The explosions distracted guards in other sections of the facility and allowed inmates to scale the walls and escape, they said. Guards opened fire, killing at least two inmates, the official said. `` It was a well-organized operation, pre-planned and possibly done with inside connivance,'' he added. The 221 prisoners escaped in six vehicles, raided a laundry about a half mile from the prison and changed their prison uniforms for civilian clothes, the official said. At least 15 escapees were caught early Wednesday about seven miles from the prison, he said. The official said authorities believe other convicts reached the town of <LOCATION> Kelaniya </LOCATION>, about five miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, and escaped by boat down the <LOCATION> Kelani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The justice ministry said army Lt. Col. <PERSON> Vipul </PERSON> <PERSON> Boteju </PERSON> was appointed to oversee all prisons in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, troops searched passenger buses and vehicles entering the capital. Police imposed an indefinite curfew in the northern neighborhoods and searched homes for escapees. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which staged a coup attempt in 1971, opposes the government's efforts to end the 5-year-old insurgency by Tamil rebels fighting for an independent homeland in the north and east provinces. The Sinhalese, who are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>, make up 75 percent of the island's 16 million people and control the government and the military. The Tamils, who are Hindu and make up 18 percent of the population, claim they are denied jobs and education by the Sinhalese. The front contends the government has offered too many concessions to the Tamils in a peace accord signed in July 1987. Since then, the Sinhalese militants have been blamed for the murders of more than 900 people, most of them government supporters.

 Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> on Wednesday met the first senior visiting foreign dignitary since he seized power, and he told journalists finally allowed into <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> that it is not ready for general elections. `` We will definitely hold this multiparty democratic election, there's no question about it,'' the general said in repeating earlier promises. He spoke with reporters accompanying <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s army chief Gen. <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyudh </PERSON> on the first visit by a senior foreign official since <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power in a Sept. 18 coup. His troops killed hundreds of demonstrators supporting democracy. The visit broke an informal international understanding to refrain from moves that might imply recognition of the Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> government. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries have frozen aid to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said that before elections could be held, authorities must ensure law and order, restore transportation and communications, and provide food, clothing and shelter for the people. `` There's been progress in these three main objectives but we've got to wait for a while,'' he said when asked the polling date `` The political parties are in the process of registration at the moment. They are not ready yet,'' he added. On the day he toppled civilian President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said he would ensure elections are held. He has allowed opposition political parties to form but suppressed all other public expressions of dissent. After returning to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON> told a news conference that his talks with <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> focused on the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government's offensive against rebel groups, students who have joined the rebels, and narcotics After the coup, thousands of students joined ethnic-based guerrilla groups on the border. The government has said the students can come back without facing punishment. At a luncheon for <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON>, <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said more than 1,500 students have returned home and authorities have arranged with <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> the return of those staying in temporary Thai camps. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> told reporters about 2,000 students remain at the border area, but <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials put the figure at 7,000. On foreign relations, <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said `` there are a few countries which look forward to consolidate friendship with us and on the other hand some countries show less interest in cooperating with us ... our policy is to establish friendship with every country.'' The Nation newspaper of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> criticized <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON>'s visit. In an editorial, it said he `` can privately try to persuade Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> to hold the promised free and fair general elections as soon as possible. Only his success in this effort _ which is so far most unlikely _ could justify making a trip to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> now.'' The newspaper said that while Thai authorities try to portray the trip as technical and military-related, the visit could send the wrong signal both to <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and the rest of the world that <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> endorsed the massacres by <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> troops.

<HEAD>Appellate Ruling Called Breakthrough for Fight Against Jet Noise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal court ruling allowing the city to be sued for damages blamed on noise from <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was hailed Wednesday as a breakthrough in the fight to cut the din in suburban communities. `` It's one of the biggest victories we've had to date,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Geils </PERSON>, village president for west suburban <LOCATION> Bensenville </LOCATION> near one of the world's busiest airports. The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruling Tuesday reversed an earlier decision that barred lawsuits against the city over its airport operations. The ruling could prompt a flood of litigation in county courts over airport noise or other nuisances, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Karaganis </PERSON>, the attorney who filed the lawsuit. <PERSON> Karaganis </PERSON>, who called the decision a landmark in the decades-old fight over <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>'s impact, estimated 210,000 residents in 20 city and suburban neighborhoods could sue <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> under the ruling. `` The old ruling was used by the City of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to beat the suburbs,'' <PERSON> Karaganis </PERSON> said. `` Now the door to the court is open.'' The lawsuit was filed for <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieneman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bensenville </LOCATION>, who seeks damages exceeding `` tens of thousands of dollars'' for property damage and personal injury from <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> noise and air pollution, <PERSON> Karaganis </PERSON> said. The case now goes to <ORGANIZATION> DuPage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and may be consolidated with similar lawsuits. `` Perhaps it will give us an opportunity to negotiate outside the courts ... and get <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to mitigate some of these concerns,'' said <PERSON> Geils </PERSON>, who serves on the <ORGANIZATION> O'Hare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miner </ORGANIZATION> had not read the decision, but said, `` I do n't view it as a loss.'' `` Studying the ramifications will take some time, so I do n't know if it opens any doors or not,'' he said. Since 1975, the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> had barred lawsuits seeking to collect damages from the city, which owns <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, for complaints resulting from airport operations. It said management of an airport was a federally regulated activity, which pre-empted state law. Other federal courts disagreed. `` We must decide whether to maintain a go-it-alone position,'' appellate Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterbrook </PERSON> wrote in Tuesday's ruling. He said the court was convinced that its 1975 ruling was wrong and that `` we should ` fess up to the error. <PERSON> Geils </PERSON> said the impact of the jet-traffic racket on schoolchildren `` has been very significant ... there is constant distraction, constant interruption of the learning process.'' Past noise-abatement efforts have been financed by the federal Airport Improvement Program trust fund overseen by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, he said, and more funds are being sought for the 12 remaining schools of 27 targeted for soundproofing in several suburban communities. <PERSON> Bieneman </PERSON> said Wednesday his O'Hare-related problems began in 1970. He cited windows and walls cracked by vibrational stress from the jet noise, landing lights that shine into one south-facing bedroom and turn night into day, and other problems. `` Why should I move? I've been here since 1949 ... it's where my kids were raised,'' said <PERSON> Bieneman </PERSON>.

 Defense lawyers rested their case Wednesday in the tax and mail fraud conspiracy trial of political maverick <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> without summoning him to testify, and then described the government's case as `` garbage'' and a `` rotting carcass.'' In their closing arguments, government prosecutors said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six associates deliberately deceived supporters who lent his controversial political movement more than $ 30 million but were never repaid. They also said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, 66, a perennial minor-party political candidate, conspired to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> by having his personal expenses paid by various corporations he controls and pretending he had no taxable income. But defense attorneys told the trial jury of seven women and five men that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and his aides were innocent of all charges and hinted that they were victims of a vengeful government. `` These people are not crazy and they are not foolish,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON>, attorney for defendant <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, a LaRouche fund-raiser. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Odin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said the government was charging some sort of `` voodoo conspiracy'' and told the jurors `` they do n't want you to decide straightforward facts _ they want you to decide garbage.'' He added: `` The bad smell in the courtroom did n't come from outside but from the rotting carcass of the government's case.'' Defense lawyer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the trial was not about money but `` about a political movement with dedicated followers who want to succeed and powerful enemies who want it to fail.'' Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he would send the case to the jury Thursday morning after a 14-day trial. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> told a reporter he was not called to the witness stand because his testimony would only `` gild the lily'' of the defense case. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said the jurors would deliberate through Saturday, if necessary, to reach a verdict. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and the six associates are charged with raising millions of dollars in loans from supporters without any intention of repaying them. In addition, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> is accused of conspiring to cheat federal tax collectors by allegedly concealing his true income. He has not filed income tax returns for any year since 1978. If convicted on all 13 counts against him, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $ 3.25 million. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> told the jurors the charges contained in a federal grand jury indictment returned on Oct. 14 had nothing to do with <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s political ideas. But, he said, they were based on the way the LaRouche organization raised its money. `` The ends, however noble they may be ... is not the point and does not justify lying to people to get their money,'' <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> said. At the same time one LaRouche fund-raiser was telling an elderly woman he could n't pay a dime on her overdue loan of more than $ 100,000, <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> said, massive improvements costing much more were being made at a 199-acre <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> farm outside <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, including a swimming pool, a pond, a guest house and a riding ring. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> conspired to hide his income from the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> by having his associates pay all his personal expenses. `` He did a good job,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't figure out even today just what his income was. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> dismissed defense attorneys' claims that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was an employee of the various entities he controlled and that the goods and services he received free represented non-taxable compensation. `` He's not an employee,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` And if he's not, his meals and lodging are taxable.'' Defense lawyer <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON> said the LaRouche people were not foolish enough to believe their money-raising efforts were certain to be a failure, and denied that they had set out to deceive their lenders. To convict them of a criminal conspiracy, he said, the government would have to prove that `` when they solicited the loans they never intended to be successful ... and if they never intended to be successful, then they intended to end up here, because they were being watched.'' <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON> claimed that `` part of the reason we are here'' is an anti-drug book published by one LaRouche organization which makes accusations against money-laundering banks and people in high places. <PERSON> Henly </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, attorney for defendant <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Spannaus </PERSON>, said, `` This political movement is not a polite one,'' but he urged the jurors to protect it against `` an over-reaching government'' which is offended by the LaRouche organization's political attacks. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said the LaRouche organization lacked a staff of professional administrators, accountants and lawyers. `` If they'd had a good office manager this might not have happened,'' he said `` Why would you intentionally cut off your life blood by defrauding these people?'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Three More Government Relief Flights Planned For Armenia</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates and adds details throughout</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government earthquake relief flights will arrive in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> before the weekend, carrying plastic sheeting, tents and other supplies, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-141s were leaving Wednesday and Thursday and a civilian plane will depart Friday, department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The last flight, in addition to relief supplies, will be carrying replacements for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government personnel who are now on site. The additional three flights will bring to eight the total since the government relief effort began. Officials say the Dec. 7 quake killed at least 55,000 people, injured 13,000 and left 500,000 homeless. The private assistance effort has included more than a dozen flights carrying over $ 3 million worth of relief assistance, including dialysis machines, medical supplies and orthopedic equipment, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. In addition, three Soviet cargo flights will arrive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over the next several days to airlift privately donated supplies to the disaster zone. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said seven of the nine <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens known or believed to be in the affected area have been reported to be safe and well. Continuing efforts are being made to learn of the remaining two. Meanwhile, eight firefighters from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> left Wednesday for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to aid in the relief efforts. The team, organized through the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, Wash.-based <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to spend about two weeks helping in excavation and aiding survivors. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollington </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambassador </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> team and former president of the <ORGANIZATION> IAFC </ORGANIZATION>, said he hopes some people buried in the rubble are still alive, as in the 1985 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> earthquake where some survivors were pulled out after 12 days. To aid in the search, team members are carrying a high-tech device called a `` thermal imager'' that uses infrared light to detect heat sources. Until now, rescue workers primarily have used dogs to search for survivors. Also on Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> architects offered to help architects in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to rebuild cities devastated by the earthquake. `` We want to ensure that it does n't happen as seriously again, here or there,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Geis </PERSON>, a consultant on natural disasters for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architects </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't know, quite frankly, much about Soviet anti-earthquake construction,'' <PERSON> Geis </PERSON> said, noting reports that poor construction may have contributed to the high death toll. <PERSON> Geis </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> architects also could learn from the quake, as they did in a visit to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> after the 1985 quake. He said rumors that much of the destruction in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was caused by shoddy construction proved to be exaggerated.

<HEAD>`Blood Will Be Shed,' Chairman Says of Farm Budget Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be forced to make painful cuts in farm programs to meet deficit-reduction targets even if there is a tax increase, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman said Wednesday. `` It's not going to be easy,'' Rep. E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told reporters. `` It's going to be very painful. There's going to be blood shed or I guess marrow because it's down to the bone We're going to have to chop into bone.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration reportedly has been weighing a $ 3 billion reduction in farm spending in the fiscal year that starts next Oct. 1. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is reckoning that cuts totaling $ 1.5 billion would meet targets under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said the administration has not told him how much it calculates will be needed to meet deficit-reduction targets. He said some farm cuts were `` inevitable, even with a tax increase.'' He said an increase would help to preserve some agricultural programs but stopped short of advocating one. `` It's not easy to vote for a tax increase, it's very difficult ...,'' the chairman said Spending on farm programs operated by the government's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> peaked at $ 26 billion in 1986 but since has steadily dwindled to an estimated $ 12 billion in the current fiscal year. Much of the decrease is attributable to built-in reductions under broad farm legislation approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> complained, however, that the built-in reductions are not counted against the amount of savings that lawmakers must find to shoulder their share of the deficit-reduction burden. One method of cutting spending being mentioned is a further reduction in target prices, set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and used to determine the size of so-called deficiency payments to wheat and feed grains producers. The levels have gradually come down under the 1985 legislation. Deficiency payments should total about $ 7.4 billion in fiscal 1990 and about $ 3 billion of that will be payable in advance, by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> reckoning. A cut in that amount also remains a possibility.

<HEAD>Number of Calls From Green River TV Show Exaggerated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A mistake by organizers of a television special on the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> serial killings led authorities to grossly exaggerate the number of telephone calls they received with crime tips, authorities said. Initial reports said as many as 60,000 calls were made to a special phone bank that was staffed by investigators. During the nationwide broadcast last week, viewers were urged to phone in tips on the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killings or any other crimes. But in the first days after the broadcast, investigators had answered no more than 7,660 calls, Lt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police's <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. Blame for the inflated figures was put mostly on a mistake in which the show's organizers confused the number of calls attempted with the number of calls received. <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, which handled the incoming calls, said about 86,200 calls had been attempted on the toll-free number broadcast during the show `` Manhunt: A Chance to End the Nightmare.'' Most callers, however, either got busy signals, did not get through because of technical problems or else apparently changed their minds and ended their calls prematurely, <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said. In addition, `` there are other people who are talking to different people in the media and it's all getting screwed up,'' he said. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said the 7,660 calls answered by police had yielded about 3,000 credible tips on the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killings and other crimes. One led Kent police to arrest two men, ages 27 and 17, in the slaying of <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Worthing </PERSON>, whose body was found Oct. 26 in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Police said, however, they do n't think her asphyxiation was related to the serial slayings. The Green River serial killer is officially blamed for the deaths of as many as 48 young women, many of them prostitutes, between the summer of 1982 and early 1984. Forty are known dead and the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has held the killer responsible for the disappearances of eight other women. Despite the discrepancies reported in the number of calls, police still have their hands full. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Police Detective <PERSON> Myrle </PERSON> <PERSON> Carner </PERSON> said 27 investigators would work full time through the holidays sorting out the calls. `` Obviously, we kind of stepped into uncharted waters on this, but, quite frankly, it's been overwhelmingly successful,'' he said.

 A bank officer was found Wednesday naked, bruised and battered at the door of a pizza restaurant, one month after she was kidnapped, authorities said. Police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents were questioning three men in connection with the Nov. 14 disappearance of <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> but authorities would not say the men were suspects. <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Warms </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> was discovered as she leaned against the door of the restaurant shortly after midnight, and employees let the woman in. Warms said Ms. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> was described as hysterical. `` Her emotional state is such -LRB- that -RRB- she really has n't been able to tell us anything about the last 30 days,'' <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> was treated and released from <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for a cut over her right eye, and bruises on both arms, according to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, was last seen the morning of Nov. 14 in her car at a drive-in window at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> police Detective <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schilling-Wallace </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> may have been trying to signal bank employees she was in trouble when she wrote a check for $ 1,000. Ms. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, who had previously worked as a bank teller supervisor, asked the teller how much she could withdraw and included her driver's license in the transaction for identification, even though she works at the bank and was well known by the tellers. `` There's a good possibility that someone was in the car with her, but we have n't been able to confirm that,'' Ms. <PERSON> Schilling-Wallace </PERSON> said. She was reported missing by her family the next day. On Nov. 16, her car was found abandoned in a K mart parking lot in <LOCATION> Euless </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Israelson </PERSON>, an agent in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> office, said the first real break in the case came late Tuesday when a woman reported to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> police she had seen a suspicious-looking car with three men and a woman inside. The description of the woman she gave was similar to that police had of Ms. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, <PERSON> Israelson </PERSON> said. When police arrived at the scene, three men were leaving the residence, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. They agreed to talk to police, and the car was impounded, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Friends and neighbors were relieved that so many days after her abduction, the ordeal ended with her escape. `` I kept having dreams, seeing her walk back through the gate,'' said a neighbor, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Staker </PERSON>, whose four children often played with Ms. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>'s 10-year-old son, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>. `` I was so happy that she was alive,'' said <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, another neighbor. `` I just felt she was n't dead the whole time. A lot of people said, ` Well, it's been too long.' I kept watch over her house every night, hoping to see signs that she'd been back. `` Although she's in terrible condition right now, it's a joyous thing they found her alive and her little boy will have her back for Christmas,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> said. `` It's the best present ever.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Anand </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheela </PERSON>, the former secretary of Indian guru <PERSON> Bhagwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shree </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>, said Wednesday after being deported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that she will return to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> but has no plans to see the guru. The Indian-born <PERSON> Sheela </PERSON>, 39, flew into <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> after serving 2 -LCB- years for crimes ranging from attempted murder to wiretapping. She was released from a prison in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Tuesday and was deported after pledging not to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for five years. <PERSON> Sheela </PERSON> was sentenced to 4 -LCB- years in prison in July 1986, but was released with time off for good behavior. `` I have no money,'' <PERSON> Sheela </PERSON> told reporters after arriving with no luggage. <PERSON> Sheela </PERSON>, accompanied by her West German lawyer, immediately left for the southern West German town of <LOCATION> Baden-Baden </LOCATION>. Authorities in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> complained that she left behind more than $ 269,000 in unpaid fines and restitution. `` It's a heck of a lot harder to collect money from someone in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> or wherever she is than if she's in prison in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON>, spokeswoman for state Attorney General <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>. Asked in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> about her future plans, <PERSON> Sheela </PERSON> said she will go back to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> but did n't think she would see the guru. After <PERSON> Sheela </PERSON> and several of her top aides fled to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in September 1985, <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON> accused her of leaving the sect $ 55 million in debt, plotting to kill him, tapping the commune's telephones and trying to bomb the county courthouse. He since has publicly said she is innocent of all those charges. <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>, on whom followers bestowed more than 90 Rolls-Royces, allowed <PERSON> Sheela </PERSON> to wield dictatorial control over as many as 4,000 followers who lived at the sect's now-defunct commune, <LOCATION> Rajneeshpuram </LOCATION>, in central Oregon. She pleaded guilty to attempted murder, assault, arson, electronic eavesdropping, immigration fraud and conspiracy. She now says she is innocent and pleaded guilty only to protect <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>, who now is at a commune in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> commune, started in 1981, collapsed after <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON> was convicted of immigration fraud and deported in November 1985. <PERSON> Sheela </PERSON> was accused of trying to kill <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>'s doctor with a poison-filled syringe, giving glasses of poisoned water to two county officials, setting fire to the county planning office, arranging more than 400 sham marriages so the guru's foreign disciples could remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, creating an extensive electronic eavesdropping system at <LOCATION> Rajneeshpuram </LOCATION> and conspiring to spread salmonella bacteria on food in 10 restaurants in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dalles </ORGANIZATION>, a city 80 miles away. More than 750 people fell ill from the contaminated restaurant salad bars, and a doctor and two county officials also fell ill.

 Former heavyweight champion <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> denied Wednesday that any surrogate imitating his voice had taken his place in numerous telephone conversations with senators, congressional aides and journalists this year. `` I've been making the calls,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> told a news conference on the east steps of the Capitol. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> specifically denied that his attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON>, had impersonated him in any calls, though he acknowledged in a hand-written statement that the lawyer had arranged several telephone conversations between himself and several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, and others. A three-part story published Sunday through Tuesday by The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and The Atlanta Constitution questioned the authenticity of the calls and quoted associates of both <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> as saying the attorney is able to imitate the former champion's voice. `` There's no truth in it,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said of the idea that someone else had spoken for him. `` I did this because I had things I wanted to say.'' His written statement specifically cited calls to Sens. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., as well as He also said he telephoned <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and gave an interview to reporter <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` Now that I am not boxing, I want to fight poverty, world hunger and etc.,'' his written statement said. `` I also campaign for people I trust and believe in, like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Asked how the story came about, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said Constitution sports columnist <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Kindred </PERSON> `` kept following me around, asking me did I make phone calls to senators. He followed me so much, I just said, ` No. I have n't made no calls.' So, he was n't writing and did n't have no pen. I looked up and a week or two later and read in the paper that <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> did n't make the calls.'' `` I'm here to tell you, it was me,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said. `` I did make the calls. And that's why we are here. I did n't know he was going to say that someone was impersonating <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>.'' `` I told him I did n't make the calls just to get him off my back,'' he said. Pressed as to whether <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> had ever impersonated him, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> replied he never did. He called <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> `` the best friend a man can have.'' He also said he had never heard <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> imitate his voice and did n't know whether he could.

<HEAD>Group Says Pentagon May Put Chemical Warheads on Cruise Missiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> environmental group on Wednesday charged that the Pentagon is considering the use of long-range cruise missiles to deliver chemical warheads and demanded a full accounting of the program's possible impact on arms control. The group, the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trends </ORGANIZATION>, said the `` Deep Fire'' program `` represents a unique threat to international peace.'' Citing a little known provision of federal law, the foundation filed a petition with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, requesting `` the preparation of a full, complete, detailed and public Arms Control Impact Statement for the chemical warfare program called ` Deep Fire.''' `` This program is designed to examine deep-strike delivery of chemical weapons, including cruise-missile delivery of chemical warfare agents. The program represents a dangerous escalation of the chemical warfare arms race.'' The petition was filed by <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, the foundation's president, who added: `` If the incoming administration truly wishes to stop the proliferation of chemical weapons, as was pledged during the campaign, it should immediately eliminate this program. According to <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, recently declassified <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> transcripts of a March 11, 1987, hearing contain the following from the Pentagon: `` Alternative long-range standoff chemical weapons being considered are the Army Tactical Missile System; powered GBU-15 glide weapon; air-launched cruise missile; ground-launched cruise missile; sea-launched cruise missile; Tomahawk, Harpoon and Advanced Interdiction Weapon System.'' According to the group, the federal Arms Control and Disarmament Act requires the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to prepare an impact statement whenever it begins work on a `` program involving technology with potential military application or weapons systems which ... may have significant impact on arms control and disarmament policy or negotiations.'' The foundation asserted no such impact statement had been prepared for the `` Deep Fire'' program. `` Clearly, research into deep-strike delivery systems for chemical warfare agents could dramatically alter strategic options for chemical warfare use. ` Deep Fire's' impacts on disarmament policy and negotiations must be fully assessed.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it did not know of any program code-named `` Deep Fire,'' but acknowledged it had been conducting `` low-level studies of standoff chemical weapons since being directed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do so in 1985.'' `` There is no program to put chemical weapons on cruise missiles,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Oborn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` And we're not sure where this ` Deep Fire' name comes from. `` We have been told by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to continue low-level studies of what chemical weapons might follow -LRB- the current generation -RRB-, and that's what we're doing.'' Given the nature of the work, <PERSON> Oborn </PERSON> said it was not clear the law requiring an impact analysis should apply in this situation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, citing production by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, recently began making a new generation of toxic chemical weapons. The weapons being made under that program, however, are either short-range artillery rounds or a bomb for delivery by an airplane. Putting a chemical warhead on a cruise missile would make it possible to deliver such a weapon more than 1,000 miles into enemy territory and to launch it either from the air, sea or ground. The Foundation on Economic Trends is an environmental group that long has focused its attention on the dangers of biological research and genetic engineering. The group has enjoyed legal success against the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in the past, succeeding in recent years in blocking construction of a new aerosol biological warfare laboratory in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and forcing preparation of an environmental impact study covering various biological research programs.

I was n't totally certain that all the responses would be so positive.'' <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> said small photographs of people will be attached to the card along with the signature labels. `` This is not politically motivated.

 The head of the world's most valuable company resigned Wednesday in a stock trading scandal that has inspired outrage about the coziness of public servants with business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s traditional big-money politics. <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, 78-year-old chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, became the 16th person _ including Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> _ to leave a high post because of links with the insider-trading case. Shinto had led the company since 1981. He said he was resigning because his secretary made a $ 163,000 profit on shares of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate firm at the center of a the scandal that began last summer. Aides to Shinto, <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> and other prominent people in politics and business were given the opportunity to buy unlisted shares in <LOCATION> Recruit-Cosmos </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, at bargain prices, some with loans provided by Recruit. They made profits by selling after the shares were offered to the public in October 1986 and the price more than doubled. Such insider transactions are legal in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but the close ties between politics and big business have come under increased criticis since this one was exposed. A statement released by <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON> said: `` I have decided to resign to take responsibility for causing trouble concerning <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> and the Recruit affair and causing people to lose trust in <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>.'' He also resigned as chairman of 16 subsidiaries of the telecommunications giant, company officials said. <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> has the largest market value of any company in the world, about $ 260 billion, or almost twice the combined worth of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Market value is the price of the company's shares multiplied by the number of shares Shinto, who has preached clean business and politics, was linked to the scandal in October when it was revealed that the aide, <PERSON> Kozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murata </PERSON>, bought 10,000 unlisted Recruit-Cosmos shares. Media reports Tuesday said about $ 73,000 was transferred from <PERSON> Murata </PERSON>'s bank account to the account of his boss. Shinto said <PERSON> Murata </PERSON> controlled the account in question, however, and denied personal involvement. <PERSON> Haruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, president of the giant company, told a news conference: `` Mr. <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON> said the transaction may have taken place, but he has no way of confirming it because Mr. <PERSON> Murata </PERSON>'s whereabouts are unknown.'' The company is the world's largest in terms of capitalization. In 1987, it earned the most corporate profits in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, $ 4.1 billion. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> and Shinto were among those considered least contaminated by traditional methods of using money for political influence in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. An editorial Thursday in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> indicated how seriously the affair has shaken public confidence. It said, in part: `` Hisashi Shinto ... has resigned. Our disillusionment is great. Shinto was always a well-respected business leader who combined wisdom with a broadness and clarity of vision ... What has become of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leaders? <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, a prominent political commentator, said many such `` clean'' politicians and company officials were unfamiliar with how big-money politics is managed. `` They often leave this business entirely to their aides, and as a result it leads to problems when something is revealed and they ca n't give persuasive explanations,'' he said. <PERSON> Seizaburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, a political commentator and <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor, said Finance Minister <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> resigned `` not because of his involvement in the scandal but because of poor management by his aide. ... He is not the only one in the Cabinet involved.. but he is the only one who either lied to the public or was lied to by his aide.'' <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, resigned in September after reports that he had sold 2 million unlisted shares in the subsidiary to influential politicians and business leaders. His secretary, <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsubara </PERSON>, director of Recruit-Cosmos, also resigned in September and has been charged with trying to bribe an opposition member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to slow the investigation. Two legislators from opposition parties gave up positions in October when their names were linked to the scandal. After those resignations, the Socialist and <ORGANIZATION> Komeito </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Clean Government -RRB- parties demanded that members of the govering <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who were involved also take responsibility. That led to <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>'s resignation. Two top newspaper executives also were among those who gave up their jobs because of connections with the insider trading. Most prominent politicians tied to the deal have stayed in office. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, his predecessor <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and governing party Secretary-General <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, a former foreign minister, acknowledged some aides were in on it but denied personal involvement.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to support guerrilla leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> as long as outside countries supply the Angolan communist government, the White House said Wednesday. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked by reporters whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> would continue after finalization of the U.S.-mediated agreement providing for the phased withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban soldiers from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by mid-1991 and the independence of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in about one year. `` We continue to support <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'' in his struggle against the Angolan government, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` He has been supportive of this recent agreement and we are hopeful that the issue between -LRB- <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> forces and the government of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> can be resolved internally.'' The agreement, reached in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, will be signed formally in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Dec. 22 by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, a former German colony rich in mineral resources, since the end of World War <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> favors negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and the government in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, but he did not know the status of possible talks. In any case, `` as long as the Angolan government is supplied by outside countries, we continue to provide support for <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> himself has said President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised him both before and after the November presidential election that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> would continue until the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> stops supplying the Angolan government and until after the Cuban troops leave. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> last year has been estimated at $ 15 million. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> planned to attend the session in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, even though the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not sign anything. `` We look forward to supporting the agreement in this concrete fashion and to discussing and assisting the parties in resolving any questions that may arise,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> borrowed to buy his young family a home in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, borrowed to help pay for his first congressional race and borrowed again to buy a house on Capitol Hill after he won. `` I'm trying to live in the two most expensive places in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' said the 31-year-old Republican congressman, who sold the home here last year because he said he could n't afford it _ not with his mortgage back home and the hefty financial burden of raising three young children. He now rents a small apartment and sees his family on weekends and when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not in session. `` That's hard,'' he said Wednesday. `` But the hardest part is trying to convince people it's rough to live on $ 89,500. That's the annual salary of rank-and-file members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a wage that would increase 50 percent to $ 135,000 if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> endorses the recommendations of a study panel that concluded its work Tuesday. Just talking about wanting more money can buy trouble. `` My appearance here kicks off my opponent's next campaign, whoever he or she is,'' Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., joked last month when he urged the presidential commission to recommend higher pay for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and federal judges <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, now entering his third term, avoided taking a stand on the salary recommendation but endorsed a related provision that would ban lawmakers from accepting honoraria. `` I can live on whatever the pay is,'' he said. The $ 135,000 figure suggested by the panel is more than nine times the average personal income in 1987. Proponents of the raises say such comparisons are unfair. They quickly point to the cost of living in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where many typical, family-sized houses sell for $ 200,000 or more. `` The average person back home just does n't understand that if a man brings his family with him down here, unless he has some personal wealth, it's difficult for him to take on that kind of a mortgage,'' said former <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Elford </PERSON> <PERSON> Cederberg </PERSON>, now president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Former </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressmen </ORGANIZATION>. `` Especially in politics, which is a rather unstable business.'' The debate is not a new one. When the first <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convened in 1789 its members were paid $ 6 for each day of the session. Twenty-seven years later lawmakers raised their pay to $ 1,500 a year but then quickly repealed the raises because of the public uproar. The opposition today is led by highly organized consumer groups and advocates such as <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, who called the latest recommendations `` a salary grab.'' But <PERSON> Cederberg </PERSON> and others say winning in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> takes a toll on the wallet. `` Republicans belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and Democrats belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Cederberg </PERSON> said. `` And there are other people and things you have to be seen around if you're going to be influential and they cost money.'' Others say opposition to the raises from constitutents often is fueled by unfair images of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lifestyle. `` There are a lot of misconceptions about how we live in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, wife of retiring <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>. `` We're ordinary people whose husbands have extraordinary jobs. We go to the grocery and we budget and we cook our own meals most of the time and do just the same things that everyone elese does.'' Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> do have to entertain and attend formal functions, but also worry about the mortgage and day care and college tuition, she said. `` There are many wealthy members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but for the great majority of us who live on the salary it's not that easy,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said. `` When we came here 30 years ago I did n't know of a congressman's wife who worked. A lot of the wives work now.'' She said the $ 135,000 recommended by the commission is `` fair'' but said there are ways to get by on $ 89,500. `` My husband still has the same tuxedo he came here with 30 years ago,'' she said. `` And I do n't even own a ball gown.''

<HEAD>Drought Effects Will Be Felt Next Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Even if depleted soil moisture is replenished, the effects of the 1988 drought will continue to be `` very much in evidence'' next year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Net cash income, the difference between cash expenses and cash gross receipts, is expected to be down somewhat from this year's near-record $ 57 billion to between $ 48 billion and $ 52 billion But the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that would still put 1989 net cash income at the fourth-highest level on record. Economists say net cash income was high in 1988 despite the drought because so many farmers sold off commodities harvested in earlier years, and because of large federal payments. Total crop and livestock receipts in 1989 are expected to rise slightly from this year's record level, the report said. As a result of the drought and the draining of stored inventories, farmers may boost crop plantings by as much as 30 million acres, but that will increase production costs. Government payments are expected to decline 20 percent to 25 percent.

 Eight Jewish organizations and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman said Wednesday they are alarmed about slow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> processing of Soviet Jews who want to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and suggested several steps, including a blanket grant of refugee status, for dealing with the backlog. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said increases in Soviet emigration have strained the resources of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies. But he said he and the Jewish groups `` are concerned that the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has started recently to apply a new and stricter definition of refugee in the case of Soviet emigres.'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, a member of the Judiciary immigration subcommittee, said in a statement that at least 177 Soviet Jews in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, the main processing point for Soviet emigres, have been denied refugee status in recent months. That development `` constitutes a departure from longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy,'' he said. `` For years, we have fought tirelessly together for the right of Soviet citizens to emigrate,'' said <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>. `` Now, when our efforts have begun to bear fruit and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has finally begun to open its gates, it is an unfortunate irony that the actions of our own government, and not the Soviet, are creating new barriers to these refugees' freedom.'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> and 34 other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members expressed similar concerns in letters to Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. The statement suggested that all Soviet Jews applying for refugee status be granted it, if necessary raising the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> quota for refugees, which is set at 24,500 for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the year that ends Sept. 30. Requests from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> alone have been running 2,000 a month. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> and the groups also proposed that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> dip into its $ 30 million emergency refugee fund to meet the costs of processing and resettling Jewish emigres and that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> work to replace the money later. Jewish refugee aid agencies `` are prepared to meet their total financial responsibilities'' in partnership with the government, the statement said. The backlog of visa applications in the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> INS office has reached more than 5,000, <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> should increase its staff in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to expedite visas, the statement suggested. And the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration should restore its policy of considering all Soviet Jews as refugees, <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Soviet Report Says Saudis Now `Compromising' On Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet official said in an interview released Wednesday that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has softened its stance on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and agrees with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that Moslem guerrillas have no exclusive right to form a future government there. The chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s department for the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> <PERSON> Galitsyn </PERSON>, was interviewed by the London-based newsletter <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mirror </LOCATION>. It quoted <PERSON> Galitsyn </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s role in acting as host at the first peace negotiations between the Soviets and the Afghan guerrillas was possible because the Saudis amended their demand for an unconditional Soviet pullout. `` The talks in Taif confirmed that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, one of the most influential Islamic states, had renounced the principle of confrontation, and is helping facilitate the Afghan settlement on the basis of balance of interests and reasonable compromise,'' <PERSON> Galitsyn </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The remarks quoted by the newsletter were telexed to The Associated Press in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Galitsyn </PERSON> was quoted as saying that the past Saudi stand at all international forums was based on no compromise with the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime and `` complete and unconditional'' withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` It looks however, as if the general global changes following an improvement in Soviet-American relations, and the assertion of the new political thinking, have had a certain impact on <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>'s outlook,'' the newletter quoted him as saying The U.N.-brokered <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords in April, where agreement was reached on the pullout of an estimated 100,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, coincided with the Soviet-U.S. summit and the intermediate nuclear forces treaty. The guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors, were not represented, but their backers, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, concluded the agreement with the Soviets. The pullout was scheduled to be completed by Feb. 15, although the Soviets have delayed because the rebels continued their military operations. <PERSON> Galitsyn </PERSON> disclosed that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> helped ensure that the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord would be accepted by the mujahedeen, the newsletter said. He did not elaborate. Referring to a visit by Soviet Foreign Ministry officials to <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> in early 1988, <PERSON> Galitsyn </PERSON> said the two sides noted that an Afghan settlement would improve the political atmosphere in the region and chart ways of eliminating other hotbeds of tension, according to <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mirror </LOCATION>. `` As the talks continued, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> gave to understand that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the settlement of this problem in general would remove the chief element undermining understanding between the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> and the Islamic world,'' he was quoted as saying, in apparent reference to Saudis linking diplomatic ties with the withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

 Approximately 8,600 employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> will be subject to random drug testing under a plan announced Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. That works out to roughly 7 percent of the 118,000-member workforce of the sprawling department that includes such agencies as the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` This department, as the nation's leader in drug abuse prevention, education, research and treatment, should take the initiative to deter illegal drug use and to assist in the rehabilitation of drug-using employees,'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said in a memo to all employees. The <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> plan, adopted in response to an executive order by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1986 requiring drug testing at all federal agencies, identifies 80 job categories subject to random testing. Most of the categories involve employees in health care and medical research, including those who provide direct patient care or who handle hazardous or sensitive materials. Security personnel and those operating potentially hazardous equipment also are included. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> called the drug testing plan `` a cruel holiday gift to thousands of innocent federal employees and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s parting shot at the constitutional rights of those who labor for the government.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NTEU </ORGANIZATION> president, said the union was examining the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> program and would sue `` at the first drop if any members of our HHS bargaining unit are included in the plan.'' He said the union had succeeded in stopping similar drug testing in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s food and nutrition division and is confident it will win its case against the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The plan also makes the department secretary and undersecretary and other senior officials subject to testing. `` The decision to go forward with random testing was made only after months of careful review and consideration of the privacy concerns of our employees,'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said in his memo. The <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> plan calls for at least 10 percent of the 8,600 employees subject to testing to be screened for marijuana and cocaine use annually. The testing technically could begin as quickly as 60 days after publication of Wednesday's memo, but department officials said it probably will take longer. Each of the employees subject to testing will be notified in writing that they are in that category at least 30 days before any testing is carried out, the memo said. In addition to random testing for current employees, the plan calls for drug tests to be administered to applicants for jobs in the covered positions.

 A pilot who suffered a heart attack while his plane was on the tarmac, waiting to depart, was quoted as saying he flew his charter flight on to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> rather than risk losing a takeoff slot, a published report said Wednesday. The charter pilot's story was among 100 reports collected under the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institue </ORGANIZATION> of Medicine's confidential human factors incident reporting program, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. The pilot and his employer were not identified, nor was the date of the incident disclosed. The pilot reported feeling an intense pain high in his chest while waiting to take off from <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. He reportedly asked his co-pilot to take over the flight to <LOCATION> Malaga </LOCATION> and `` to keep an eye on me.'' `` At that time of the morning in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> there was no one available to give medical advice at short notice,'' the pilot was quoted as saying. `` I had 119 passengers already on the aircraft and a tight departure slot, missing which would have meant a five-hour delay.'' Despite further pain, the pilot accepted another flight the next day. `` On return, I found I was not able to walk in from the aircraft without the pain returning,'' he was quoted as saying. Three days later, the pilot said he collapsed during a cardiac stress test at a hospital and suffered a massive heart attack.

 A Roman Catholic priest's suit to regain his theology chair at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> went to trial Wednesday _ pitting claims of academic freedom against the church's right to discipline its clergy. The Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> claims the university breached his contract by removing him from a tenured theology professorship because of his dissent from church teaching. The university contends that it was merely enforcing the highest authority of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, which had revoked <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s right to teach Roman Catholic theology. As an ordained priest, the university contends, <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> has an obligation to obey the revocation of his `` canonical mission'' to teach <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> theology. The non-jury trial in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> provides an unusual look at the internal functioning of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy, particularly the steps taken to discipline a priest for holding theological views at odds with those of the church. It will feature the testimony of two of the church's highest officials in this country. The first witness to take the stand in Judge <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON>'s courtroom was Cardinal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and chancellor of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and a former chairman of the university's trustees, also is scheduled to testify. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, argued that his client was illegally denied the rights of academic freedom that were specifically adopted following a strike in 1967. `` If the notion of academic freedom in the specific context of the present case means anything, it means the university guaranteed a freedom in the face of public dissent from certain church teachings,'' <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said in pre-trial arguments. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s disagreement with church teachings on homosexuality and birth control and other positions he took in his book, `` Faithful Dissent,'' prompted <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> authorities to declare him unqualified to teach Catholic theology. `` Father <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> thinks he has n't an obligation to his church to abide by this declaration,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Baine </PERSON>, an attorney representing the university. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> wants to transform <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> into something that he `` wants it to be,'' <PERSON> Baine </PERSON> argued. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> was, in effect, asking the university to join him in defying orders from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baine </PERSON> said. The judge agreed with <PERSON> Baine </PERSON>'s contention that he has no power to decide whether <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s dismissal was consistent with church law. But <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON> ruled that the issue in dispute was whether both sides understood canon law governed <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s contract to teach at the university when it was signed and renewed. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, who rejected an offer to teach ethics outside the university's religious faculty, contends he never was explicitly conferred a `` canonical mission'' to teach theology. But in his testimony, <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> rejected this claim, saying such a mission was implicitly granted to <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> when he was hired in 1965. <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> testified that revoking <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s status on the theology faculty was justified because `` the case of Father <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> had become a widely known matter.'' `` It has caused, in my opinion, a great deal of harm to the church.'' the archbishop testified. It was particularly important that <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> be disciplined because of the university's `` unique relationship both with the Holy See and the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in this country.'' `` It seems inconceivable to the board of trustees of the university that we could simply join in defiance on the part of Father <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> testified. Since his suspension from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, 54, has been a visiting professor at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He currently has a one-year appointment at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Judges Ask AIDS-infected Inmates to Enter Pleas By Phone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three judges say they asked defendents infected with the AIDS virus to telephone in their pleas to protect the court staff, but advocates for AIDS victims called the judges paranoid and their action unconstitutional. <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Judges <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, O.L. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said they simply asked that the defendants waive their right to appear in court, and all did so. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said their bailiffs do n't want to handle the prisoners for fear of getting acquired immune deficiency syndrome. `` I do n't think we can ban them, but if I suggest -LRB- to their lawyers -RRB- that maybe they do n't want to be here, they waive their rights,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` I'm not going to bring someone in here erupted with herpes or tuberculosis. It's not just AIDS,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. `` I'm not going to have someone come down here and infect the general public and me.'' One of the inmates, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>, said he wanted to appear in court but was afraid he would anger the judge and receive a harsher sentence if he did. `` My lawyer told me to do it over the phone because he did n't want to make him -LRB- the judge -RRB- mad,'' <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Herald </ORGANIZATION> interview published Tuesday <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Haeberle </PERSON>, a member of the state board of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION>, said the judges were disregarding their obligation to provide defendants with `` speedy, public trials.'' But the judges denied any constitutional rights were violated. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said no guidelines on courtroom handling of AIDS defendants were available from the state <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I guess we'll have to decide on a case-by-case basis,'' he said. The bailiffs and the judges were concerned about a violent defendant, who could bite or bleed in a fight, <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said. But Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Saag </PERSON>, an AIDS specialist at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, said it was unlikely that a person could get infected with the AIDS virus through a human bite or during a fight. `` To my knowledge it has never happened,'' he said. A report by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surgeon general on AIDS transmission says that although the AIDS virus has been found in saliva, no instance of transmission from saliva has been reported. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> used a telephone hookup to listen to the guilty plea entered April 29 by <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> on a burglary charge. The judge gave him probation, but <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>, 30, was back behind bars when interviewed recently. Now locked up on third-degree theft and stolen property charges, along with probation violation, <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> is being kept in medical isolation with two other inmates who tested positive for the AIDS virus. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gespass </PERSON>, an attorney who now represents <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>, has filed a petition to overturn <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>'s convictions because his client was not in court to give his plea or to be sentenced. `` Everyone has a right to face their accusers and the right to be present in a court to be sentenced,'' <PERSON> Gespass </PERSON> said. `` They're so paranoid, they do n't want anyone in who's even thought to have AIDS,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blalock </PERSON>, who previously represented <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>. `` I think it's a misunderstanding of how it can be transmitted.''

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice on Wednesday sentenced a guerrilla commander and nine other mixed-race men to prison terms of up to 15 years for grenade and mine attacks. About 200 people, mostly women, lined the streets outside the courthouse and sang `` God Bless Africa'' after the decision. Some protesters who followed the van leaving with the prisoners were chased and bitten by police dogs. Justice <PERSON> Denys </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> handed out prison terms ranging from two to 15 years, but gave four of the men suspended sentences. After they were freed, Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> hailed the four as `` heroes'' in the struggle against the system of apartheid. When the van carrying the 10 sentenced prisoners appeared, the crowd ran down the street after it, and policemen with dogs chased them. Several people were bitten and knocked down on the street by the dogs, who were on leashes. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said he had no quarrel with the broad political beliefs of the accused but said they were being punished for the means they used to achieve their aims. Six had admitted some degree of complicity in the attacks, but they also said they had been coerced into giving evidence. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, 22, commander of guerrilla units in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> area, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for terrorism and playing a leading role in the armed wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> described him as `` a dedicated terrorist.'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> was found guilty in September of setting a mine that exploded at a bus shelter near the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> home of President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and of staging three grenade attacks on policemen's homes. Two people were injured in the attacks. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, 23, was sentenced to 14 years for the bombing of an electrical pylon and staging a grenade attack. <PERSON> Nicklo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON>, 20, also received a 14-year sentence for acting as <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>' contact. The other seven, all in their 20s, were sentenced to terms of two to 12 years for storing arms and participating in grenade and gasoline bomb attacks on policemen's homes. The four given suspended sentences received a standing ovation when they entered St. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s Cathedral and were welcomed by <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> as `` our heroes.'' `` In the history we shall write in this country your names and the names of your sons will be written in letters of gold,'' said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. He said those who had been sentenced `` love freedom and justice so much that they are prepared to pay the price for it.'' The four were found guilty of failing to report a suspected terrorist, hiding a grenade and failing to report an intended gasoline bomb attack. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end apartheid and replace the government with a one-man, one-vote political system.

He campaigned actively as a `` favorite son'' candidate before the 1960 Democratic convention but lost to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Symington </PERSON> was probably best-known as the watchdog of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s armed forces for nearly 30 years of public service, not only in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but before that as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> In the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Symington </PERSON> served as the nation's first <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> secretary from 1947-1950 In 1945, after <PERSON> Symington </PERSON> had become a millionaire industrialist with a knack for troubleshooting ailing industries, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> called him to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he was surplus property administrator and then assistant secretary of war for air. In 1947, when the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> became a separate service, <PERSON> Symington </PERSON> became secretary under the reorganized <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

But as defense expenditures mounted in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he became a critic of ever-larger Pentagon budgets and an opponent of a number of costly and elaborate weapons projects. In the 1970s, he became increasingly concerned over the proliferation of nuclear weapons and became a vocal advocate of arms control. <PERSON> Symington </PERSON> served in World War I as an Army second lieutenant.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Wednesday he had authorized the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to enter into `` a substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. His announcement came after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Ara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was insisting on a clear, unequivocal statement to clear the way for discussions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office said later that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have no statement on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he had discussed the decision with representatives of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and he added, `` Our commitment to the security of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> remains unflinching.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statement included this language on the equally difficult question of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> involvement in terrorist activities: `` I repeat for the record that we totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism, including individual terrorism, group and the state terrorism.'' In response to a question, he said, `` I do expect and hope that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will drop its veto so that the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> can be discussed.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was aware of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision, said, `` The president and the vice president both have followed these developments closely and they have reviewed, each of them, this most recent development, and they both agree that under these circumstances the conditions for a substantive dialogue that we have had in place since 1975 have been met and so we should state that we are ready to undertake that dialogue.'' At his news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed to maintain a tough stand on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and insisted that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> make a definitive statement about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and a clear renunciation of terrorism. That means that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the legislative arm of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, must subscribe to the statement as well as <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to relinquish territory captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Six-Day war. But while saying that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ought to be `` pulling back'' in compliance with two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions, the president-elect placed much greater emphasis on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` I want a clear statement on renunciation of terror,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I want a very clear, unambiguous statement on the right of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to exist as a state, and I want a clear endorsement of <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution 242.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited the resolution's assurance that all states _ by implication <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as well as the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> _ have a right to live within secure boundaries. `` If Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> takes a step that brings us a little closer to that, fine, we're glad that happens,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But, he went on, `` Before we have a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> the signals have to be clear, unmistakable, unambiguous ...'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spoke almost simultaneously and it was not clear whether he was aware of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman's statements during the news conference. Before <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s speech Tuesday to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, Swedish diplomats passed the word that he was about to satisfy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> notified Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, but then in <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s judgment the speech fell short. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his statement, subscribed to the three-point test set by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The three requirements are explicit recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, renunciation of terrorism in all forms and acceptance of the two <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> by telephone from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to have `` a more positive reaction'' to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s latest moves, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who demanded anonymity.

 A wave of strikes swept <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> on Wednesday when public sector employees, educators and hospital staff walked out to protest the government's budget for next year. About 1,000 protesters marched through the capital shouting slogans against the Socialist government's $ 27 billion budget _ the highest in the country's history with a projected deficit of $ 9.2 billion. The demonstrators marched through the city center to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, where it is being debated by the lawmakers. Most of the strikers demand inflation-indexed salary increases and higher basic salaries. Inflation is expected to reach 15 percent this year. Some public transportation and ministerial services were hampered as state engineers staged a strike, and employees of municipalities in and around the capital began a six-day walkout. Officials asked the public to refrain from putting out their garbage until the strike ended. Public schools ranging from elementary to university level, closed down for the day as teachers and professors protested the government's allocation for education. The educators want the government to allocate at least 15 percent of the budget for education instead of the less than 10 percent budgeted. The bigger allocation would cover an increase in salaries, more books and improved educational facilities ranging from laboratories to housing for university students. Public hospitals maintained skeleton crews for emergencies only as doctors and staff staged a 24-hour strike to demand higher wages and to protest the allocation in the budget for health services. The government said the budget deficit will be covered by increased taxes on tobacco, alcohol and lottery tickets and through domestic and foreign loans.

 A witness at the trial of confessed <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> on Wednesday linked <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s case to the commandeering of an Air Afrique airliner in 1987 in which a Frenchman was killed. `` Among the demands made by the Air Afrique hijacker -LRB- <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> was the freedom of the <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> brothers in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' said witness <PERSON> Theodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Heusele </PERSON>, a West German federal police investigator. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is charged with murder and air piracy in the hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight 847 on June 14, 1985 on a flight from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. <PERSON> Heusele </PERSON>, 51, told the court he had been involved with the <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> case since the Lebanese man was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport Jan. 13, 1987. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, is serving a 13-year prison term in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for his part in kidnapping two German businessmen in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to try and gain his brother's release. The two Germans have since been freed. <PERSON> Heusele </PERSON> was asked by the court if there was any connection between <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and another Shiite Moslem, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, who is accused of last year's hijacking of the Air Afrique airliner. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where he diverted the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afrique </ORGANIZATION> jet on a flight from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on July 24, 1987. Swiss officials say <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> shot and killed a French passenger on the plane before police overpowered him. <PERSON> Heusele </PERSON> noted that during the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and his accomplice aboard the plane, identified as <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON>, demanded the release of all Shiite Moslem prisoners being held in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> later released 700 of the prisoners. `` <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> was among those released by the Israelis,'' <PERSON> Heusele </PERSON> told the court. But <PERSON> Heusele </PERSON> said investigators were unable to connect <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> or <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON> to other hijackings, although <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has told the court in previous testimony that his accomplice was involved in an earlier hijacking. <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON> remains a fugitive. Since <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial began in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on July 5, numerous witnesses have said the hijackers on <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight 847 savagely beat passengers and forced the plane to land three times in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and twice in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was shot and killed when the plane landed the second time in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> early on June 15, 1985. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has admitted taking part in the hijacking, but has repeatedly said his accomplice killed <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. The trial, in a high security courtroom in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s Preungesheim prison compound, was recessed until Dec. 20 when another federal police investigator is scheduled to testify

 <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> announced Wednesday he is willing to become finance minister, removing a major roadblock to forming a national coalition government with the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, TV reports said. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, now foreign minister, said he would accept the finance post on condition he have full freedom to deal with economic matters, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> aides were not available at offices or residences to comment on the report. Negotiators from the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and Labor have been holding renewed talks since Monday in an effort to form a broad-based government. The two leading parties have been jockeying for support from smaller religious parties to form a government after parliamentary elections on Nov. 1, when <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s 39 in the 120-seat parliament. Wednesday's announcement represents a major concession by the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, who wanted to be foreign minister in a new government because it would allow him to pursue a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative. The move also could hurt <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' popularity because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s recession and high inflation could bring about unpopular economic measures In making his announcement, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said Labor should head a parliamentary committee responsible for making key economic decisions. The <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc has said one of its own members should head the committee. The television said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> ministers ended a meeting late Wednesday and reported that differences remained between <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor, particularly over policy on Jewish settlements in occupied territory. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who leads <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, has pressed talks with Labor in an apparent effort to avoid some far-reaching concessions to the religious parties on sensitive issues, including a law defining who is a Jew. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish groups have strongly opposed the law. Labor has demanded two of the four key government posts o join a broad-based government. Labor's defense minister, <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, is expected to keep his post. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is expected to remain prime minister. Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> have governed jointly since inconclusive elections in 1984.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had no plans to delay the repatriation of some convicted Mariel Cuban detainees to their homeland. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, a deputy associate attorney general, said no change in the plans to repatriate Cubans was contemplated and that the next load of detainees would be flown to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> shortly. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> released a statement Wednesday night saying four Mariel Cubans would be deported Thursday morning. The detainees were scheduled to board a plane at the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, airport for the flight back to their homeland. However, an aide to Auxiliary Bishop <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, who discussed the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> issue with top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials Wednesday, said Roman would pursue the matter further with <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Penalver </PERSON>, a lawyer representing Roman, told reporters that a 1984 agreement with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> under which the repatriation of some detainees was resumed earlier this month involves `` very, very serious foreign policy implications.'' He would not elaborate. Roman met with Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said the `` basic argument'' of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> delegation was that a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> process of examining whether the detainees should be repatriated was `` a paper review'' rather than a full-fledged hearing with witnesses and presentation of evidence. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> review program has survived legal challenges and `` we expect to continue in this manner,'' <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said, although department officials agreed to consider specific written complaints which the Roman delegation will submit. Some 400 Mariel Cubans are on a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> list of people who might face repatriation, and another 400 to 500 will be placed on the list once they finish serving prison and jail terms. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> repatriation review process was established in the aftermath of riots by Cuban detainees in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, a year ago. The riots were triggered by plans to resume repatriation of the prisoners to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The program finally resumed Dec. 2 with the return of five detainees to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The five were among 125,000 people who had fled <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in the so-called Mariel flotilla in 1980.

 <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> exists, a judge ruled on Wednesday, after an appearance on the witness chair from a rosy-nosed old gent in a red suit and white beard who rumbled a familiar `` Ho, ho, ho!'' `` I am going to make a determination that there is a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>,'' decided Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Choppelas </PERSON>. He was presiding at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s mock <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, a just-for-fun <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> tradition with a real judge and lawyers. `` As long as there is love and generosity and gift-giving,'' Choppelas went on, `` this court is going to find that there really, really is a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>.'' In a grave tone, the judge said he was drawing partly on legal precedent set in the old movie, `` Miracle on 34th Street,'' in which a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court found for the defendant _ <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Choppelas </PERSON> made his own ruling after a rollicking, 90-minute `` trial'' to consider the question, `` Is There Really a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>?'' Some 150 spectators and journalists listened to the half-serious, half-comical `` testimony'' that talked about love and heart and spirit and an open hand. The inquiry started with a radio announcer's dramatic reading of <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s `` A Visit From St. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>.'' Anti-Claus lawyer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> objected to the poem. Pro-Claus lawyer <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelder </PERSON>, a city supervisor, then asked the spectators which of them had never written a letter to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. The request outraged Winston, who advised the audience, `` Take the Fifth Amendment.'' Winston poked fun at a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> doll, which was introduced as evidence. He flipped it upside down and said, `` Made in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, hah!'' `` There is no proof <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> was ever in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>,'' he said, noting that his fingerprints have never been found by police. He drew a retort that <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> was no criminal. Testifying for the pro-Claus side, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> Specialist <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> displayed a large drawing of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, postmark and said firmly that none of the thousands of letters from children addressed to the gentleman were `` returned to sender.'' <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> said, however, that it was not possible for <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> to be in `` zillions of places'' at once around the world. `` He has helpers,'' said <PERSON> Nelder </PERSON>. `` He's talented.'' Finally, `` Ho, ho, ho!'' boomed out from behind a door and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> himself, toting a sack with toys and a golf club, appeared and sat down in the witness chair. <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> attacked him, but <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> quickly put him in his place. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> reminded <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> that `` I got a letter from you when you were 6 years old.''

<HEAD>Panel Refuses to Endorse Energy Department's Plan to Restart
Reactor</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Weapons Reactors</HEAD>

 The head of a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> scientific advisory committee said Wednesday the panel is refusing to endorse the department's plan for restarting one of the three weapons production reactors currently shut down at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, said of <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed strategy for restarting the K reactor at the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> plant: `` I think our main concern with it is that it is quite incomplete. ... It's only a first step.'' The just-completed DOE report outlined more than 160 separate tasks for restarting the reactor, calling for a complete overhaul of training, safety, management, operating and inspection procedures. It concluded that national security demands will require startup of the K reactor before long-term safety improvements are completed. The three reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> are the nation's only source for tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen vital to boosting the explosive power of modern nuclear warheads. Because tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, it needs to be replenished regularly. In an interview, <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON> said his committee was sending a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> spelling out the panel's concerns `` The overall gist of the letter ... is that we're essentially declining to endorse the restart strategy. ... We see a large set of problems. ... We think it is insufficient to be used as the basis to go ahead and restart,'' he said. <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, voiced concerns in several areas, including: _ Restart philosophy `` We did n't see represented in the document something that could be called an overall philosophy. In other words, what kind of safety standards is the department trying to achieve?'' _ Setting safety criteria `` We did n't really believe that the department had laid out clearly enough what must be done. There are a number of descriptions in that document that have the character of improving safety. ... But it's not clear what would be an acceptance criterion. So how would you know that you've met what must be done before restart?'' _ Ultrasonic testing of pipes and welds The DOE report failed to specify use of high-tech ultrasonic testing techniques to help find potentially dangerous cracks in piping. _ Seismic resistance `` We do n't see in reading the seismic description any clear statement of what level -LRB- of earthquake resistance -RRB- the reactors must be brought to.'' _ Management `` We are concerned that the management approach that has been taken has now got too many people telling <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the plant people, what to do. It's confusing to try to get a clear line of authority. And that, in the long run, we thought would be a major problem.''

 In what was already the deadliest year for <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police, a fifth slaying was added when an undercover police officer was fatally shot in a drug sting operation that went awry. Officer <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON>, 43, was killed Tuesday night while trying to buy drugs from several suspects at a convenience store to make a drug-buy arrest with his partner, police spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. Another man was killed and two others wounded. Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> described the department's mood as `` somber,'' following the fifth shooting death of an officer this year. `` Four was unbelievable,'' he said. `` Five was just _ I do n't know You do n't know what to say.'' Before 1988, the year with the most police killings was 1972, when three officers died. <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON>, shot in the abdomen, chest and both arms, was pronounced dead at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, about 30 minutes after the shootout. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jocimino </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> died of gunshot wounds to the chest and back at <ORGANIZATION> Parkland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, emergency room supervisor <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, 20, was in serious condition Wednesday at <LOCATION> Parkland </LOCATION> with wounds to the chest and abdomen, and <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, 17, was in serious condition with wounds to both legs, officials said. `` It is my understanding that it was a buy-bust situation _ a drug buy _ and we had more than one officer at the scene,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON> said. `` Instead of the drug deal reaching fruition, they were hijacked, as they say, shots were exchanged and our officer was fatally wounded.'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> alleged that <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> fired the shots that killed <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was `` definitely an active participant in this robbery attempt and murder.'' Both <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> have been charged with capital murder, and <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> also was charged with unlawful delivery of a controlled substance, police said. Police at the scene of the shootout recovered 107 grams, or about 4 ounces, of a white powder believed to be cocaine. <PERSON> Jacomino </PERSON>, who was in a car across the street from the Stop' n Go when he was shot to death, drove <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> to the store for the drug deal, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jacomino </PERSON> was fatally shot by bullets fired by backup police officer Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, authorities said. Police said they do not know whether <PERSON> Jacomino </PERSON> was armed. <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON>, with 17 years as a police officer, had been a narcotics officer since 1986. He also worked in that division from 1976-81. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> observed 30 seconds of silence Wednesday in honor of the slain officer. The other officers killed this year are: <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, while he questioned two burglary suspects; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, in a confrontation with a homeless person; <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, during an attempted robbery in a grocery store; and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, while answering a disturbance in an apartment complex. The department has been criticized by some council members and community minority leaders, who have accused police of being too trigger-happy. In the Chase shooting, a mentally ill man grapped the officer's gun in scuffle A witness told police that three men standing nearby urged the man to shoot Chase. That incident prompted former Police Chief <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> to accuse council members of creating an anti-police sentiment that led to the attack.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Wednesday he renounces `` all forms of terrorism'' and recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to live in peace and security. Hours later, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will begin a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision means `` we can speak about an era of peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' He also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> now was `` isolated'' because of its policies. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> he authorized the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to enter into `` a substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told a news conference, held simultaneously with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement, `` Our object is not a dialogue, our object is peace.'' The Israeli Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> denounced the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision in a statement: `` We regret the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decision to establish contact with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. We do not consider that this step will advance the peace process in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' An Israeli government official, speaking early Thursday in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on the condition he not be identified, said neither <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> nor other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials consulted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> before the move. `` Not at all,'' he said. The official also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> believed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> failed to fulfill conditions laid down by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for recognition of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, both in his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday and at a news conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Wednesday. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> later left <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told reporters in response to a question, `` I do expect and hope that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will drop its veto so that the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> can be discussed,'' referring to the earlier <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refusal to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Wednesday night that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` does not recognize the declaration of an independent Palestinian state,'' made by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> last month, but that it would be a subject of discussion. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> channel for dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would be the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, the duty officer at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ensher </PERSON>, said he had no immediate information. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> watched <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on TV with Swedish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> was instrumental in arranging for a delegation of American Jews to meet <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and was widely reported to have acted as go-between in the past few days for <LOCATION> American-Palestinian </LOCATION> contacts in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> smiled broadly and nodded when <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> remarked during the telecast that President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was consulted on the proceedings in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> later told reporters, `` I say that this is, this American statement to open dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, is a historic change in the struggle in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. With this American decision we can speak about an era of peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> ... peace for us and our enemies, also.'' He said in reference to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>: `` They are isolated. They are alone at this moment because of their unrealistic policies. They should recognize the right of the Palestinian state to exist like their state.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, scheduled to end Thursday, was held in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused to grant <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to speak at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It had made little progress toward holding an international conference on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> wants. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> began his news conference with a statement in English, calling on European nations to play a greater role in bringing about <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace and insisting the Palestinian desire for peace was real. `` I repeat for the record that we totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism, including individual terrorism, group and the state terrorism,'' he said. But the Israeli official in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said Thursday that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s remarks were `` insufficient'' because the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> did not rule out violence associated with the year-old <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which has left more than 320 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> made clear the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> accepts `` the right of all parties concerned in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict to exist in peace and security, and as I have mentioned including the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other neighbors.'' He said again that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> accepts U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which recognize the right of all Middle Eastern nations to safe and secure borders. The acceptance is one of three conditions set by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law for dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The other are a clear recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renunciation of terrorism by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Speaking mostly in Arabic and some English in answering questions, he showed impatience with a question asking him to say `` yes'' or `` no'' on whether he accepts <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Did n't you read my statement?'' he asked, referring to his Tuesday speech. `` It's entirely clear. What do you want? Do you want me to do a striptease? It would be unseemly.'' In a speech before the world body on Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said the world should tell Israelis and Arabs it is tired of their long conflict. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to `` face up to the need for withdrawal from occupied territories'' and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to `` accommodate the reality of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence.'' Diplomats from Arab nations, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> backed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s call for an international peace conference. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> called <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s address `` a new and very important contribution to the peace process.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a stunning reversal, said Wednesday that he had authorized the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to enter into `` a substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has long denounced as a terrorist organization. The announcement came after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that he was renouncing `` all forms of terrorism.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision put to an end decades of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> isolation of the Palestinian group, which Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> less than three weeks ago accused anew of terrorism. The move shocked the Israeli government. Even before the official announcement, the Israeli embassy called the decision regrettable and said it would not advance the cause of peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will pursue its policy of searching for peaceful solutions to the conflict through direct negotiations with Palestinian Arabs and with <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>,'' the Israeli statement said. <PERSON> Hassah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the decision to open a dialogue was `` the right thing to do.'' Asked whether it was a defeat for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> he told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` It's not a victory for one party over the other.'' `` Our object is not a dialogue, our object is peace,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters simultaneous to the release of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement. `` When there will be a meeting, I do n't know.'' Asked if he had changed his mind about the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said: `` I did n't change my mind. They made their statements clear.'' But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had issued a statement in which it met all three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for a dialogue: acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions affirming the right of all states to live in peace, recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renunciation of terrorism. `` As a result, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared for a substantive dialogue with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives,'' the secretary of state said. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spoke of the equally difficult question of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> involvement in terrorist activities: `` I repeat for the record that we totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism, including individual terrorism, group and the state terrorism.'' In response to a question, he said, `` I do expect and hope that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will drop its veto so that the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> can be discussed.'' The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he did not detect anything new in what <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Wednesday. He said he hoped the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision would not lead to recognition of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am disappointed by this decision,'' <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> said. `` I am not trying to minimize that. But on the other hand, I think we should keep a perspective on the overall relationship between the two countries.'' <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s remarks at a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> news conference do not supersede the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s covenant, which calls for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s destruction. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, hailed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision, calling it an `` important step forward in movement toward a real peace process.'' `` The dialogue should throw into sharp relief the failure of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to say yes to the very issues that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has now acceded to. Our hope is that the dialogue is productive and that peace is now possible.'' Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruen </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> affairs of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to insist that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` match words with deeds. Specifically, we call upon them to end their attacks on Israeli civilians and all other forms of terrorism ... and formally to change the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s Charter, which still calls for the dissolution of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that the opening offered by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements `` may be a blind alley, but an alley worth treading with eyes open This dialogue in no way mitigates our steadfast support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But I hope <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will at least be willing to informally acknowledge this process as a worthy attempt.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said that by its decision, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is taking `` a major risk for peace.'' The center warned in a statement that the road <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` have chosen to embark upon is fraught with danger and may be sending the wrong message to the world: that terrorism does pay.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not attempt to steer <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to make a similar decision. `` It's totally for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to make its own decisions,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` does not recognize the declaration of an independent Palestinian state,'' but that it would be a subject of discussion. He said the channel for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he believes there should be direct negotiations between `` the parties'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but that he knew of nothing to suggest this was imminent <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a written statement, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had accepted <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, and had renounced terrorism. `` These have long been our conditions for a substantive dialogue. They have been met. Therefore, I have authorized the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to enter into a substantive dialogue with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The announcement represented a turnaround from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position 24 hours earlier when it said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had not made a clear acceptance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now that we see a change in the posture of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> all we're doing is following through,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told a hastily assembled news conference that was carried live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the evening newscasts He spoke cautiously, picking each word with care and was quick to reaffirm the American commitment to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and to stress that the action does not recognized the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as an independent state. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' position had changed because <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had declared explicitly that he recognized the right of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to exist. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions had been well known since 1975 when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last held serious talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, at his <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> news conference, insisted his past statements mean he recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to live in peace and security. He spoke as President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was insisting on a clear, unequivocal statement to clear the way for discussions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office said later that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have no statement on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he had discussed the decision with representatives of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and he added, `` Our commitment to the security of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> remains unflinching.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was aware of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision, said, `` The president and the vice president both have followed these developments closely and they have reviewed, each of them, this most recent development, and they both agree that under these circumstances the conditions for a substantive dialogue that we have had in place since 1975 have been met and so we should state that we are ready to undertake that dialogue.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spoke almost simultaneously and it was not clear whether he was aware of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman's statements during the news conference. At his news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed to maintain a tough stand on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and insisted that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> make a definitive statement about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and a clear renunciation of terrorism. That means that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the legislative arm of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, must subscribe to the statement as well as <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to relinquish territory captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Six-Day war. But while saying that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ought to be `` pulling back'' in compliance with two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions, the president-elect placed much greater emphasis on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited the resolution's assurance that all states _ by implication <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as well as the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> _ have a right to live within secure boundaries. `` If Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> takes a step that brings us a little closer to that, fine, we're glad that happens,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But, he went on, `` Before we have a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> the signals have to be clear, unmistakable, unambiguous ...''

 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> launched a political offensive in the last month to convince <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the world they are peaceful, moderate, and worthy of representing Palestinians in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. That campaign, punctuated by three major statements, ended Wednesday with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreeing to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The first major move in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> campaign came Nov. 15 in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, when the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile proclaimed a Palestinian state. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the state would be established on territory now occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. At the same time, the council issued a political declaration accepting <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 242, which calls for secure borders for all the states in the region. That statement amounted to implicit recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The declaration also rejected terrorism, restricting <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla action to military targets in the Israeli-occupied territories. On Dec. 6, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> took the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> drive a step further when he elaborated on the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s action in his own meeting with a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. He told the Jews that his organization accepts <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and condemns all forms of terrorism, including `` state terrorism.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> uses that term to refer to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military action in the occupied territories. Finally, on Tuesday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> before the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> made a direct appeal to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders to join peace talks. He offered a three-point peace plan calling for an international peace conference, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision of Israeli-occupied territory and a `` comprehensive settlement'' involving all states in the region. Speaking to reporters Wednesday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said again that he renounces all terrorism and recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to live in peace and security. He also made a direct appeal for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to reverse its policy of refusing to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do expect and hope that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will drop its veto,'' he said.

 Soul legend <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> testified Wednesday that he did n't stop for law enforcement officers during a high-speed chase because he feared for his life. `` I was scared to death,'' he said. `` I went to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and I was n't that frightened.'' His attorneys also tried to show that authorities acted recklessly during the pursuit. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 55, was on trial for two counts of assault with intent to kill and one count of failure to stop a motor vehicle when signaled by a law enforcement officer. If convicted of all charges, he could be sentenced to as much as 30 years in prison. He was arrested Sept. 24 after a chase through <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, which is across the state line in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. He entered an innocent plea Monday, just before the trial began. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, known as `` the Godfather of Soul,'' allegedly tried to run over two <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> police officers and failed to stop for a blue light and siren. He testified that he did n't remember driving more than 80 mph and did n't remember police initially trying to pull him over. But he said he later became aware of officers pursuing him. When he did stop, he said the officers scared him by shooting at his truck and banging on the windows. The singer, wearing a gray suit and blue satin shirt, sat quietly throughout most of the preceding testimony. His wife, 33-year-old <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, sat across the aisle from her husband. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaughter </PERSON> testified that the pursuit involved between 10 to 14 vehicles and reached speeds between 60 mph and 85 mph. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, he said, refused to stop for authorities during the chase, and on several occasions when he did appear to stop, he sped away from officers. Police Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Luckey </PERSON> testified that he nearly collided with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> `` when he swerved into my path.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> led them in their chase into lanes for oncoming traffic and onto the sidewalk, he said. `` It was pretty obvious that the truck was n't going to stop, that it was n't going to pay any attention to anything in its way,'' <PERSON> Luckey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s attorney, asked <PERSON> Delaughter </PERSON> whether he was aware of pedestrians, other cars and law enforcement vehicles during the chase. `` I was more concerned with Mr. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and his shotgun than -LRB- with -RRB- the other officers around me,'' <PERSON> Delaughter </PERSON> said. `` I was advised by my lieutenant that he had a shotgun.'' <PERSON> Delaughter </PERSON> also testified that several officers shot at the tires on <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s red and white pickup truck. In response to a question by Weeks, <PERSON> Delaughter </PERSON> said he was aware of the other officers' positions when he fired at the tires.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who once convinced Wall Street and talk show hosts that he was a teen-age business genius, was convicted Wednesday on all counts in the ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning securities fraud case. The 22-year-old <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who was just 16 when he started his business, was convicted on 57 federal counts of swindling investors in a phony restoration business. He had contended he was the terrified puppet of mobsters, but the jury believed prosecutors who said he was a canny youthful con man. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> was calm as the word `` guilty'' was pronounced in the courtroom 57 times. Once during the 40-minute reading of the verdict, he reached over and clutched the hand of his attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>. The panelists came to their decision shortly after they concluded hearing a reading of the testimony of <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s co-defendant, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON>, an accountant who was charged with taking a bribe to cover up the ZZZZ Best frauds. The jurors, who have been deliberating for five days, said they had not yet reached a verdict on charges against <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s co-defendant, accountant <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON> After telling the judge they were too emotionally drained to continue discussions Wednesday, they recessed for the day and were to resume deliberations on <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON> on Thursday. The <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> case was among the most bizarre developments to rock the volatile money markets in recent years. The ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company had been one of the hottest items on Wall Street before scandal erupted and the business collapsed. Large banks and brokerages lost millions along with small investors, and it became clear that <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, once hailed as a business `` whiz kid,'' was not the boy wonder he seemed. True, he was only 16 when he started a carpet cleaning business in his parents' garage in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. But he admitted during the four-month trial that his claim that <ORGANIZATION> ZZZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> made a fortune on restoring fire and water damaged buildings was a lie. `` He sold investors on a business that for the most part did not exist,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Asperger </PERSON> told jurors in opening statements. He said <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s manipulations cost investors more than $ 25 million while the young entrepreneur lived in a $ 1 million house and drove a red Ferrari. Sentencing for <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> was set for Feb. 21, and <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> said he hoped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickran </PERSON> <PERSON> Tevrizian </PERSON> would be lenient. Theoretically, <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> could draw up to 300 years in prison. `` <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> is a young man,'' <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> said. `` He never said he did n't do anything wrong ... I would hope <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> will still be a young man when he is released.'' <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> also confirmed that defense and prosecution lawyers had been nearing a possible plea bargain agreement at the time the jurors announced they had reached a verdict. The prosecutors would say only that they were pleased with the verdict but would comment no further until <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON>'s section of the case was resolved. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who had captivated the press and public with the story of his youthful success, openly admitted that he had defrauded investors out of millions. But he insisted it was n't his fault. `` I was just a front man for the mob,'' he told jurors as part of his risky defense of duress. He claimed that Mafia figures, stock manipulators and thugs infiltrated his business, threatened him with death and orchestrated the huge ZZZZ Best fraud. He named the late reputed mobster <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Catain </PERSON> as a key figure in his intimidation and said others, including a loan shark named <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON>, used death threats to win his cooperation. `` I did n't resist anymore,'' he said. `` I was just a puppet. ... I was out of objecting strength. It was over. I just did as I was told.'' But the prosecution portrayed <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> as a shrewd con man who defrauded others to satisfy his thirst for fame and fortune. `` Power, prestige and money are the three things most important to <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>. He called <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> `` a pathological liar'' and said, `` This defense of duress just does n't fly.'' Ten of <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s former associates, including <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON>, have pleaded guilty to various charges stemming from the ZZZZ Best frauds.

 A large creche the state erected in front of the Capitol can remain despite objections that it amounts to state sponsorship of religion, a federal judge ruled Wednesday. But the state was ordered to meet several conditions by Monday or remove the barn-like structure with its manger and animal pens. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertelsman </PERSON> said the state must come up with private funding and post a large disclaimer stating that it is not endorsing any religion. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> had sought to force the state to remove the creche, which is without figurines of the infant <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and other humans. Its request for an injunction was turned down. <PERSON> Suzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Post </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, said from her <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> office that she had not read the opinion. `` What we would have liked, obviously, is for the thing to be taken down right now. ... On the other hand, what the judge has done is acknowledge that there has to be a separation between church and state,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> wo n't decide until next week whether to appeal the ruling. <PERSON> Bertelsman </PERSON>'s first condition was that `` all past and future expenditures of public funds ... be defrayed by private contributions.'' The landscaped creche cost the state about $ 2,400, including materials and the salaries of the state workers who put it up, court papers showed. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hable </PERSON>, a lawyer for Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, said he believed the state already had been offered enough money to recover what had been spent on the creche to date and to pay for its continued maintenance. <PERSON> Bertelsman </PERSON>'s second condition was that the state erect a prominent disclaimer, readable by anyone passing in a car. He dictated this wording: `` This display was not constructed with public funds and does not constitute an endorsement by the commonwealth of any religion or religious doctrine.'' He also ordered the state to post a public notice that the area around the creche is a `` public forum ... available to all responsible citizens and civic and religious groups for holiday ceremonies, pageants or displays.'' Finally, <PERSON> Bertelsman </PERSON> said the state must adopt a policy on the creche's use. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abell </PERSON>, another of <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>'s lawyers, said he believed <PERSON> Bertelsman </PERSON>'s conditions were `` just and equitable'' and that he would recommend the state accept them. Attorneys for <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> contended the creche was only part of a general Christmas display, a reminder of the holiday's religious significance and, therefore, constitutional. The 30-foot state Christmas tree was about 100 yards behind the creche. Elsewhere on the Capitol grounds, trees and lampposts have been decorated with lights, ribbons and holly. And the state's large floral clock behind the Capitol was decorated as a huge snowflake. But the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> said the creche was `` the dominant structure,'' the first thing a visitor would see and had `` the primary effect of sponsoring ... religion.'' The judge disagreed, saying that the stable structure could be interpreted `` not as an endorsement of religion or any religious doctrine, but merely as a reminder of the religious origins of Christmas,'' <PERSON> Bertelsman </PERSON> said. The creche, although without traditional human figurines for legal reasons, was staffed on some nights by members of area churches as a living nativity scene.

<HEAD>Congressional Panel Urges Increased Role for Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Schools should be open longer and allow their buildings to be used for community purposes such as alcohol and drug counseling, a congressional panel recommended Wednesday. All American students should have access to early childhood education, according to a report by the subcommittee on education and health of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said more students should have a chance to go to college so they can prepare to compete in today's complex work environment. `` It seems obvious that kindergarten through grade 12 education, which was adequate for the work force of a predominantly agricultural nation adapting to industrialization, is simply obsolete in today's complex and sophisticated high-tech environment,'' <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON> said. `` It is clear to me that we must assure a higher education opportunity for all eligible students just as we did for returning soldiers after World War II,'' he said. The subcommittee's report, based on nine days of hearings, proposed a longer school year and said schools should be kept open nights, weekends, holidays and summers. Schools should be viewed as `` capital investments in the communities'' and used for many civic needs such as drug and alcohol counseling, adult literacy programs and job counseling, the subcommittee recommended. Children should be taught `` higher order skills,'' <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON> said, `` not only reading, writing and math but teaching children how to think and how to learn.'' Schools also should update vocational education programs and increase the availability and quality of on-the-job training, the subcommittee said.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team flew to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Thursday to receive 38 sets of remains believed to be those of missing Americans in the largest such turnover since the Vietnam War ended. During the repatriation ceremony scheduled Thursday at <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Noi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the Vietnamese also were to turn over information on 12 other cases of Americans listed as missing in action, or MIAs, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> At the ceremony, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military honor guard will solemnly load the remains, each in metal caskets topped with a folded <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, onto a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane for the flight to <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> will analyze the remains to determine if they belong to any of the 1,747 MIAs still listed from the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. Vietnamese officials usually do preliminary analyses, but the army laboratory sometimes finds among the remains those of Vietnamese individuals. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government appreciates the initiative taken by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to repatriate these remains and hopes to continue the increasing cooperation to resolve this long-standing issue,'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it had not received any information from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on precisely where the latest remains to be exchanged had been recovered or the circumstances surrounding their discovery. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> added, however, that `` we understand the remains as well as the information are related to incidents that occurred -LRB- during the war -RRB- in the northern provinces.'' Most missing Americans in the north were airmen shot down on bombing or reconnaissance missions. All told, the remains of 172 Americans have been repatriated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and subsequently identified by the Army laboratory since the end of the war. The previous largest turnover of remains believed to be those of MIAs involved 27 sets handed over April 6. The most recent turnover involved 23 sets repatriated Nov. 3. Thursday's repatriation will be the seventh since retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, acting as a special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential envoy, reached agreement with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> to end months of deadlock on the MIA issue. In all, 138 sets of remains have been returned since the August 1987 agreement in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. The first American combat troops in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> landed in <LOCATION> Danang </LOCATION>, then in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, in March 1965. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Peace Accords in January 1973 halted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighting in the conflict, which killed about 58,000 Americans and ended in the communist victory over the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government in April 1975. Bitter political bickering between <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has often blocked accounting for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missing since then. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government says it will not consider normalizing relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> withdraws all its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and resolves the MIA issue. Currently, 2,383 Americans are listed as MIA as a result of the war: 1,747 are missing in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, 547 in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, 83 in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and six in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> officials were continuing Thursday a joint excavation in southern <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> province to try to determine the fate of a pilot shot down in 1968. The excavation, to be completed in a few days, is the fourth such joint project in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>`1000 Airplanes' Opens in New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` 1000 Airplanes on the Roof'' begins with a sound that gets louder, until a listener thinks a jet is about to land in his or her vibrating stomach. It's the sound that M hears just before he gets a headache, then goes into an out-of-body experience. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, the minimalist or post-minimalist composer who is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most successful opera composer, wrote the music for `` 1000 Airplanes.'' It's an opera for an actor who does n't sing but speaks in coordination with the rhythm of music by the eight-member <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ensemble </ORGANIZATION>, seated on the stage. The actor, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, is riveting in his 90-minute acted monologue by playwright <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwang </PERSON>, whose `` M. Butterfly'' is on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> walks around in the set, slide projections in air from nine projectors, designed by <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirlin </PERSON>. The opera had its premiere in August in Hangar 3 at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s airport It opened for eight performances here Wednesday night at the Beacon Theater, usually a rock venue. A 38-city American tour began Sept. 22 and will run through Feb. 28. As M begins his story, one wonders whether he is crazy, dreaming, on LSD, getting shock treatments or the protagonist of a science fiction story. Once, on a farm, he says, the heavens opened, the sound came and alien beings took him away with them. Another time, he grabbed a beehive, thinking from bee-sting pain he'd learn the meaning of life. Now, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, taking a walk with a girl, his apartment house disappears. He runs, steps outside time, looks into his own mind, travels in a spaceship, sees the face of an alien and understands why people seek soulmates. Coming to, he remembers being told to deny his way-out and inner realizations or he'll be an outcast. He regretfully does that, then really forgets, but fears that a headache will start something again. Glass's music is enormously popular these days and one assumes it is a larger attraction even than the story, symbolism and holographic scenery. Small bursts of melody repeat for a brief time, often the opposite of Indian music which has a drone underneath. Here, the drone may be a soprano saxophone; the stabs of rhythm and melody come in lower tones. There are many different, interesting melodies in `` 1000 Airplanes.'' One does n't feel, as was the case sometimes in the past, that the entire opera is repeating one melody with slight variations. Since imitation <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON> and jagged, unsingable intervals are n't working in modern opera, maybe Glass has the answer

 A jury Wednesday convicted a self-described neo-Nazi skinhead of attempted second-degree murder and malicious harassment for a knife attack on a black man last summer. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Worl </PERSON>, 24, a transient from <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, had been charged with attempted first-degree murder but was convicted of the lesser charge for attacking <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 29, in a supermarket parking lot July 30. The case was believed to be the first time a person has been prosecuted in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state on a charge of malicious harassment, which is defined as causing physical injury with the intent to harass or intimidate someone because of race, color or ancestry. After a week of testimony, the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated about four hours before returning its verdict. <PERSON> Worl </PERSON> had come to the <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> area a week before the attack because, he said, he was attracted by the Aryan Nations white supremacist church based in nearby <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The prosecution had argued that <PERSON> Worl </PERSON>'s attack was unprovoked and motivated by racial hatred. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Worl </PERSON> approached him while he was sitting in his car, and that <PERSON> Worl </PERSON> stabbed and slashed him with a knife. <PERSON> Worl </PERSON> was the only witness in his own defense. He testified Tuesday that he approached <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> to panhandle for money, then rushed <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and slashed at him with a knife in self-defense because he thought <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> had a gun. Defense attorney <PERSON> Maryann </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> attempted to counter the claim of racism in her closing arguments, telling jurors that <PERSON> Worl </PERSON>'s beliefs were not on trial. `` Skinheads are n't on trial,'' she said. `` White supremacy is n't on trial The Aryan Nations is n't on trial. Racism is not on trial.'' The skinhead subculture and style of dress emerged in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in the 1960s. Segments of the movement later took on Nazi overtones and since have been associated with the white supremacist groups. No sentencing date was set. A juvenile co-defendant charged with attempted murder and malicious harassment is scheduled to stand trial next month in Juvenile Court.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, recruiting again from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, named <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> as secretary of agriculture Wednesday. He also said `` it would surprise me'' if an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> check had turned up anything to preclude <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> from being defense secretary. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was confident Tower could do an excellent job `` if I decide to go that route.'' The former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s counsel, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, to review material developed by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> during an extensive background check, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> officials said the investigation was at an end While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised to bring in a new team of players when his administration takes office Jan. 20, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> is the fifth holdover from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, where he served three years in the Cabinet-level post of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s selection delighted farm-state lawmakers and others. `` <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> is a pro,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont. `` His experience and knowledge on trade issues will be a big plus.'' <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was an outstanding choice who `` understands agriculture and its problems.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a news conference, also said he expected to name a black to his cabinet. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, who is black, has been touted as a leading candidate to head the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Thursday's editions that another black, <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Becton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a retired three-star Army general who now heads the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, is the leading candidate to head the Department of Veterans Affairs. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> also quoted sources as saying that Federal Trade Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, who is Hispanic, is a candidate to head the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said she had no information on the possible appointments. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s freewheeling news conference focused heavily on foreign policy issues. Fielding questions, he appeared relaxed and confident. He hinted his administration would seek a delay in February's resumption of arms control talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` There is no way that we are going to have by Feb. 15 or 16 a detailed point-by-point program on arms talks,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We're not going to have it.'' `` We are going to start working vigorously and I will send whatever signal it takes'' to convey that message, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I am interested in progress but I want it to be prudent. I want whatever steps we take to be lasting.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his advisers still have not completed assessing Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement of a 500,000 cutback in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> forces, a reduction of about 10 percent in <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troop strength. On another matter, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there was `` some movement forward'' toward moderation in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liberation </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Organization </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s speech this week, but `` not enough'' to warrant direct dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wants `` clear, unmistakeable, unambiguous'' declarations that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> renounces terrorism, recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and will work within key <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions. On other issues, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ Said Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s role would be `` very much like the Reagan-Bush relationship. He said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would be a `` key player'' in national security affairs if he wants to be and that there may be specific assignments in other areas. _ Said he has not considered how to pay for cleaning up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons production plants Likewise, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said had not yet addressed the problem of the homeless in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which he called `` a national shame.'' _ Avoided commenting on whether there were ethical lapses among members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but said he would send ethics legislation to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> `` very, very early'' in his administration _ Said he would not seek substantial cuts in existing farm programs but did n't say what he meant by substantial `` I do not believe we will balance the budget eventually on the backs of farmers.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent part of his day meeting with labor leaders and also with women from inside and outside government. He said he was `` determined to have an administration that's broadly representative'' of all groups. `` That clearly means that there will be active women in high levels of the administration,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He also conferred with <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a Republican who lost his bid for a fourth <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> was a leading advocate on Capitol Hill for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and environmentalists and others are promoting him as a possible head of the agency. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sixth Cabinet nominee, joining <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration veterans <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, former treasury secretary, named secretary of state; <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, picked to stay as treasury secretary; <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, to stay as attorney general, and <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, who will stay as education secretary. The new commerce secretary, longtime <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> friend <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, is new to the Cabinet. Officials say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hopes to round out his Cabinet by Christmas. By many accounts, announcement could come soon on <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, head of the Chicago-area <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, to be transportation secretary. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, 58, a former <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> farmer, was chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, and served in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and as deputy trade representative in the administration of President Ford. Tower has been considered a top prospect for <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary for years, but his expected appointment by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been delayed by an extensive <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation of his dealings with defense contractors and aspects of his personal life. Disagreeing with concerns raised in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, transition co-chairman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said Tower would be strengthened by the long background check because no stone has been left unturned. Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have said the uncertainty and delay has weakened Tower politically. After going through a difficult divorce, Tower has been questioned about allegations raised by his former wife, as well as his ties with defense contractors, sources say.

 Researchers who hope to study the secrets of nature at the government's planned $ 4.4 billion super collider may first need protection from a venomous ant with a penchant for munching its way through underground cables.

The ill-tempered ant inflicts painful bites, is blamed by local residents for disabling home and farm equipment, and has caused power failures by chewing through underground cables, the department reports.

Subatomic particles will be accelerated to astronomical speeds inside the tunnel and studied by scientists hoping to learn more about the fundamental nature of matter and energy.

 <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> is hoping a guest shot as a sheriff gone bad on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` In the Heat of the Night'' will revive his television career. Ames stars in the drama series next Tuesday as Sheriff <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, an old friend of Police Chief <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> -RRB-, who undergoes a change for the worse after the death of his wife. Ames is best known to television audiences for playing <PERSON> Mingo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>'s Oxford-educated Cherokee Indian companion on `` <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>'' 20 years ago. After he left the series in 1968, <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> resumed his singing career. In recent years he has worked mostly in regional theater and performed in concerts. `` In the Heat of the Night'' stars <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> as chief of police in fictional <LOCATION> Sparta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> as the chief of detectives. The series was inspired by the Oscar-winning 1967 movie of the same name that starred <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> as a Southern sheriff forced to accept the help of a black detective, played by <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON>, to solve a murder case. The series is in its second season. Ames plays `` a sheriff whose life kind of collapses,'' he said. `` He lets his personal problems influence his professional duties and he begins to abuse his prisoners. He's Chief <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>'s oldest friend, and they end up on opposite sides of the fence. `` It starts when a black rookie policeman -LRB- from <LOCATION> Sparta </LOCATION> -RRB- arrests an old friend who's fleeing <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s jail. He pleads not to be sent back. When he is sent back and dies in <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s jail, the black policeman has himself arrested so he can investigate the charges.'' The rookie officer, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweet </PERSON>, is played by new cast member <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> has a hard time believing all this about his old friend,'' said <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>. `` But his young policeman gets badly beaten in my jail. What I like is that none of this violence is shown on screen. `` I liked this script because it deals with police brutality. It takes another look at ethnic prisoners and the police. It does n't make the guy into a monster He was a man who had helped people, but when he went bad there was no system in the community to deal with it.'' Ames has worked in regional theater in recent years, appearing in such plays as `` Fiddler on the Roof,'' `` Man of La Mancha'' and `` South Pacific.'' `` I've also been in ` Shenandoah,' a musical adapted from the movie with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>,'' he said. He played <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, `` a man who was indifferent to the Civil War until his family became involved. The play's a metaphor for what's happening in the world today. He's the little guy on the farm who's caught between the two sides.'' <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> did a guest shot on `` Murder, She Wrote'' a few years ago, but otherwise had rarely appeared on television. `` I've decided I want to come back and do television and films again,'' he said. `` I must confess that after ` <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>' I wanted to do some theater. I had a hit record come out, and it started a whole new career for me again as a musical artist.'' He had been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, a popular singing group.

<HEAD>`A Very Brady Christmas' Indeed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 What do you do when you tell your friends you ca n't have dinner with them because you have to watch `` A Very Brady Christmas,'' and they are thrilled and come over with takeout blinis to watch it with you? You sit down and watch `` A Very Brady Christmas.'' The holiday movie is n't on until Sunday, but we had a review tape from CBS. My friends were mightily impressed at getting to see `` A Very Brady Christmas'' before anybody else in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Yep, it's the same living room,'' one friend remarked as the show began. She recalled the earth tones of the original <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> house and exactly where the furniture was. `` Same kitchen,'' another friend noted. `` The faucet's different. It's a washerless faucet.'' I'm glad they noticed all this. I was never big on `` The Brady Bunch'' myself. I preferred `` The Partridge Family.'' My friends were just as quick to detect changes in the show's 25-year-old sensibility as they were to spot new upholstery on the dining room chairs `` There's definitely more sex in this one,'' said one. `` They never had sex in the old one. Just kids.'' Interesting observation. Might make a trend story. As the movie opened, we immediately learned that Christmas was coming, and <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> -RRB- was planning to surprise <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- with a trip to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> was going to surprise <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> with a trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. What a knee-slapper! This had all the makings of an extremely Brady Christmas, indeed. What do the Bradys do? Flip a coin? Arm-wrestle? No way. They use the money to send plane tickets to all the kids so Christmas can be even <PERSON> Bradier </PERSON>. There are also subplots. One is a `` Towering Inferno'' kind of thing. In another, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> the maid -LRB- <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> -RRB- is distraught because her husband, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> the butcher, has left her for a younger woman. But we did n't especially care, because our real goal in watching `` A Very Brady Christmas'' was at hand: what do the kids look like as adults? <PERSON> Greg </PERSON>, the oldest boy, is a doctor. He has a moustache and is balding. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, the middle one, has turned into a yuppie. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>, the youngest one, is blond and races cars. `` I remember when he and his sister tried to break the world's record by going up and down on that thing in the backyard,'' said one of my friends, awash in sentiment `` What's that thing that goes up and down?'' A teeter-totter? `` Yeah, the teeter-totter.'' Yeesh. These reunion movies really raise the conversation level. Anyway, on to the girls. <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON>, the oldest one, looks pretty much the same. Jan, the middle one, looks pretty much the same. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, the little one, looks remarkably the same considering she's played by a different actress. Well, it turns out that every one of The Brady Bunch had A Very Secret Reason for not wanting to come to A Very Brady Christmas. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON>'s wife had gone off to see her family instead. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON>'s husband had moved out of the house. <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON>'s husband has lost his job. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> was tired of being treated like a baby. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> did n't want the family to know he was afraid of marrying his girlfriend because she's his boss. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> had dropped out of graduate school. Detecting a philosophical facet of the script lost on me, one of my friends noted, `` This is definitely what Christmas reunions are about _ deception.'' OK, we were Bradied out. We had seen the kids, and we had figured out all the subplots. All that was left was for <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> the butcher to show up. `` I can see it a mile away,'' snorted one of my friends. `` They'll all decide it's best to be honest.'' In the end, they all decided it was best to be honest. And <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> the Butcher showed up.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Just one year ago there existed a widely held view that the feverish pace of mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyouts would begin fading like so many other fierce fads of business. That assumption was no better than some of the economic forecasts made at the time, which you will recall was just weeks after the great stock market shock of 1987, which some people thought was a forerunner of recession. Recession did n't come, and neither did an end to the pace of takeovers. The latter defied the stock market shock, economic uncertainty, `` poison pill'' takeover defenses and more. In fact, the pace actually quickened. The New Year had scarecely begun, for example, when a $ 4 billion takeover bid for Sterling Drug opened the flood gates for what now appears to be a record year for mergers and acquisitions. Figures compiled by <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, Conn.-based international investment firm, show that transactions in the first nine months amounted to $ 198 billion, or 35 percent ahead of the 1987 pace. With an estimated $ 72 billion worth of deals announced early in the fourth quarter, this year's activity should easily exceed the record $ 204 billion reached in 1986. So, will the pace decline in 1989? <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> thinks so. Because of its sheer size, says <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the recent $ 24.53 billion <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> leveraged buyout deal received intense scrutiny, `` the end result of which was overwhelmingly negative public opinion.'' Despite management assertions about increasing productivity and enhancing shareholder value, it asserts that `` RJR has heightened the nearly universal perception that greed _ and not competitiveness _ is the prime motivation behind most leveraged buyouts.'' Greed is a sin, to be sure, but it is not officially a crime. Criminal fads run up against the law and meet their demise. But nowhere in the past is there substantial evidence that mere sinful fads scored the conscience of the greedy. The reason must lie elsewhere. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> agrees that while the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are increasingly concerned about takeover activities, debt financing, the reduction in equities and lost taxes, they are a long way from taking effective action. That is, it might take those two bodies more than the time alloted to the year 1989 to produce restraints on takeovers. What, then, will slow the pace? <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> thinks the answer might lie in the realities of the marketplace. `` The economics of takeovers are not what they were five years ago when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> Industrial Average was 900 points lower,'' it states. When combined with higher interest rates and other unfavorable economic factors, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> believes this relative lack of value argues for a slowdown of takeover activity in 1989. It adds one more reason for such thinking, suggesting that while the greed of managers has n't necessarily lessened, their self-interest might have become intensified by activities in 1988. Specifically, `` with the spectacular failure of management's bid in the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> takeover, corporate managers may now think twice before putting their companies into play,'' it states.

 At a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> church this Sunday, that commemorated Christmas pair, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, will be portrayed in a modern mode _ a homeless couple hunting for shelter. This has become the plight of hundreds of thousands of people across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today, just as it was the plight of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> 2,000 years ago in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. `` They also were homeless,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> of Calvary-St. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> whose annual candlelight service is presenting their situation as current rather than past They, like many nowadays, `` had no place to stay,'' adds <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, who also heads the board of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s interfaith Partnership for the Homeless. `` That family also was wandering the streets. `` They had to deliver the child in a backyard stable, a cave. Then they faced persecution and had to flee. They had to leave for another country. They were refugees.'' In a similar way, he says the growing multitude of homeless Americans is a `` crisis not just in the lives of individual victims, but a crisis in the whole identification of this nation.'' As chairman of an organization described as the nation's largest private local program providing the homeless with food, shelter and some permanent housing, <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> added in an interview: `` The growing callousness and willingness of people to live side-by_side with this tragedy affects everyone. What we see is the erosion of the worth of life, of the dignity of the human person. `` We see more and more tolerance of violence, a depreciation of life. Our nation is really at a crossroads. If we do n't resolve the issue of homelessness, every cherished institution in American life will be affected by cynicism and doubt.'' Estimates have placed the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homeless at up to 3 million, wandering the streets and byways of cities across the country, crowding soup lines, hunting temporary shelter by night. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said President-Elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s expressed hopes for a `` gentler, quieter'' nation are n't likely `` if he does n't listen to the cries in the streets of the homeless. `` There's no way American society can be deaf and blind to this crisis. Most people are hoping <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> provides leadership in dealing with it.'' <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said that while the spreading severity of the problem may represent the `` dark side'' of the picture, the massive volunteer response to it represents the `` brighter side.'' `` An incredible number of institutions are working on this crisis,'' he said. `` Millions of volunteers of religious, educational and philanthropic institutions are involved. It's a real sign of hope. `` Literally every community and town on the face of this nation, through individuals and groups, has mobilized support for hungry and homeless people. If the President builds on that, we can have hope that this terrible tragedy will be alleviated.'' <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, who estimates <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s homeless at about 50,000, said the inter-organizational partnership here has become a `` model for places all over the country. Hundreds of them have picked it up.'' He said the `` the key to it is partnership,'' not only among religious congregations, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION>, Roman Catholic and Jewish, but also with civic, labor and other organizations as well as city and state agencies. `` We present a united response, cooperative and not confrontational, that maximizes communication in dealing with the system,'' he said. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, 51, who twice has been nominated unsuccessfully for diocesan bishop _ in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ said that 400 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> churches and synagogues are involved in providing food and shelter to the homeless The congregations run 130 shelters that house about 2,000 people per night _ totalling 400,000 last winter with more than a million meals served About 24,000 volunteers have served in the program since it began in 1982. It started then with only two churches _ <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and Calvary-St. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, but has since spread to a wide inter-religious Besides the sheltering and feeding program, the partnership also runs a permanent housing operation, <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Domicile </ORGANIZATION>, which has helped relocate 3,700 homeless people from shelters and welfare hotels to permanent apartments. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, also a director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Landmarks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservancy </ORGANIZATION> that helps fund restoration of historic sites, said a criticial need in reducing homelessness is reform of the welfare system. It `` is not supportive of family life,'' he said. `` It ought to support and encourage families to stay together and encourage stability.'' Under the circumstances, he said, `` Some of the most heroic people in the country are women raising children.'' Describing a sick, young woman with an eight-months-old infant who fell into the subway tracks at <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Union Square and who was lifted out just before a train roared in, he said: `` That's the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madonna </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>King Louis XVI Acquitted in French Retrial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A jury of French citizens has acquitted King <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON> of `` conspiring against public liberty and national security,'' thus reversing one of the momentous events of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> revolutionary history. Unfortunately for <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>, it came a bit late. In a strange mixture of old and new, of the 18th century and the modern, the private TF1 television network and <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> retried `` <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Capet </PERSON>,'' using a combination of present-day lawyers and costumed actors. Then the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> people were asked to judge. This time around, 196 years after the real <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> went to the guillotine for treason, the French of 1988 felt a little more sympathetic to the man who in his time was a symbol of despotism. This time he also had a hot-shot criminal lawyer. The mock trial, shown live for nearly 1 -LCB- hours on prime time television, is part of the run-up to the bicentennial of the French Revolution next July 14. At the end of the television trial, the viewers were given an hour to cast their votes by telephone for acquittal, exile or death. The result, announced at the beginning of the evening's last newscast just before midnight, was 55 percent for acquittal, 27.5 percent for death and 17.5 percent for sending the monarch into exile. In actuality, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> was condemned to death by a majority of one. The real <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON>, unable to control the revolution or escape it, first was reduced to a figurehead, then finally put on trial by the Convention, which later became the National Assembly. He was convicted and beheaded Jan. 21, 1793. His wife, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON>, was guillotined the following October after her conviction of treason. For the purposes of television, however, the king was retried in a courtroom by a three-judge panel wearing blue, white and red revolutionary plumes, costumed prosecutors and other court personnel. The defense lawyer wore a dark business suit. The audience was clearly amateur and 20th century. `` I reject in advance your judgment,'' the 39-year-old king told the court before announcing he would not respond to questions. `` Only God can judge me. `` The republic does not exist. I remain king, even from my jail cell,'' he said showing the great dignity history says he showed during his actual trial. The show seemed an awkward confusion of part text, part improvisation, bumbled lines and mixing of historical periods _ such as when one accuser called the king, with great foresight, `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s first collaborator.'' Representing the king was <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Verges </PERSON>, a defense lawyer who has made a career out of defending controversial figures, including the Nazi war criminal <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>. Among the accusers was <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Collard </PERSON>, one of the French legal profession's young golden boys. The public prosecutor was played by writer <PERSON> Jean-Edern </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallier </PERSON>, whose role was mostly a matter of interjecting occasional demands for <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>' head. The witnesses for the prosecution _ revolutionaries <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Danton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean-Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Villaud-Varenne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maximilien </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Robespierre </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Daunou </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Thierry </PERSON>, the king's valet _ were vague in their accusations but vehement in their beliefs. Weighing heavily against <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> was the fact that he tried to run for it in June 1791, but was caught at <LOCATION> Varennes </LOCATION>. That was considered proof that he was off to get a foreign army to help restore him to power. The only witness for the defense, <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamoignon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Malesherbes </PERSON>, a minister under <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> who emigrated during the revolution, praised the accomplishments of the reign. He testified that <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> was a man of peace who did well in war, winning the only naval victory ever over <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and successful in aiding the American Revolution. He said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> also took <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to the heights of scientific advances, fostered a tolerance that protected Jews and restored the civil rights of Protestants. Verges and Collard battled in modern-day courtroom style, some of it obviously not programmed, prompting the judge to warn them not to make it a `` personal duel.'' `` <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON> was guillotined,'' said Prosecutor <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouquier-Tinville </PERSON>, slipping down the historical path prematurely. `` You do n't remake history. You do n't repair accidents of history. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Capet </PERSON>, you will be guillotined because you were guillotined.'' Verges, in his real-life favorite tactic, accused the accusers, asking why they did not abolish royalty in 1789 and establish a republic. `` If <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> disappears, his son becomes king. Will you kill his son too?'' In the end, reasonableness and mercy prevailed. And when the acquittal was announced, there were more than a few cries of `` Vive le Roi!'' from the audience in the television theater.

 Christmas Week 20 years ago was transformed into a magic and memorable occasion by three American a had embarked on man's first visit to explore another world, the riskiest and deepest penetration yet into the void of his universe. Apollo 8 was to circle the moon 10 times in 20 hours on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, gathering navigational, photographic and spacecraft performance data vitally needed before Americans could attempt to land on the moon in 1969. The Christmas-time launch was a coincidence of orbital mechanics. The constantly-moving moon is in position to receive visitors from Earth only three or four days each month. The spacecraft performed perfectly. The men inside did not fare as well. All three experienced slight motion sickness, and <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> suffered insomnia and 24-hour intestinal flu. The next day they felt fine, and, looking out the window, they saw, for the first time, the Earth in its entirety, from 200,000 miles away. Overwhelmed, they transmitted to the television screens of millions of homes this spectacular view of a gleaming marble-like sphere of blues and greens and browns and whites. `` You're looking at yourself,'' radioed <PERSON> Borman </PERSON>, acting as a tour guide. `` What you're seeing is the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. In the center, just lower to the center, is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, all the way down to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>. I can see <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the southwestern part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> continued, describing royal-blue waters, bright white clouds and brownish land areas. `` What I keep imagining is, if I'm some lonely traveler from another planet, what I'd think of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> at this altitude _ whether I think it would be inhabited or not. Those television pictures had an overwhelming impact, giving humans a new perspective of their planet. Many felt more than ever that <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> was a beautiful planet, worth working to save. The picture of this lonely, delicate celestial body became a rallying point for environmentalists worldwide. Minutes after the astronauts signed off the television show, Apollo 8 raced into the `` equigravisphere,'' a twilight zone where the gravitational pull of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and moon are equal. Now, less than 40,000 miles from the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Borman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> did what no human had done before. They came under the prime influence of the moon's gravity. The spacecraft, its speed gradually falling during the outward journey, was traveling only 2,200 mph. Early on Christmas Eve day, when <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> gave the go-ahead for lunar orbit, the moon's gravity tug had accelerated the speed to 5,800 mph, fast enough to swing the ship back toward <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> if a braking rocket failed to slow the craft to orbital speed The spacecraft moved around to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>'s backside, cutting radio contact with ground control. For 36 agonizing minutes, the world waited. Was the engine firing a success? Not until the ship emerged around the moon's edge was the answer known. `` We've got it!'' shouted a voice in Mission Control amid a bedlam of cheers. `` Apollo 8 is in lunar orbit!'' <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON>, the first to expound on the moon from only 70 miles distant, said, `` It looks like plaster of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, a sort of grayish beach sand.'' He had answered the first of many questions about that alien body that had awed humans since their beginning. During the next 20 hours would come answers to many more. Throughout the day, the astronauts snapped thousands of photographs and motion pictures. In the first of two telecasts from lunar orbit, they relayed pictures of a wild and wondrous landscape pitted with massive craters. `` It looks like a vast, lonely, forbidding place, an expanse of nothing ... clouds of pumice stone,'' <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> saw the distant Earth as `` a grand oasis in the big vastness of space.'' The moonmen surveyed and photographed all five of the prime sites being considered for the first Apollo manned landing mission. They practiced identifying and tracking lunar landmarks and discovered new ones. By evening, the astronauts were tired but so buoyed by their achievements that they expanded a telecast from a planned 15 minutes to 37 minutes. While their camera scanned the lunar desert, blinding in the sunlight, forbidding in the shadow, and with an estimated half a billion people watching, some already celebrating Christmas, <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> said, `` For all the people on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, the crew of Apollo 8 has a message we would like to send you.'' Silence fell over many households as, with the striking television pictures as a backdrop, <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> began reading the story of the creation from Genesis: `` In the beginning, God created the heaven and the Earth. And the Earth was without form, and void and darkness were upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, ` Let there be light.' And there was light. And God saw the light and it was good. And God divided the light from darkness.'' <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> continued, `` And God called the light day. And the darkness he called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, ` Let there be a firmament,' and God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. And God called the firmament heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.'' From <PERSON> Borman </PERSON>: `` And God said, ` Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place. And let the dry land appear.' And it was so. And God called the dry land Earth. And the gathering together of the waters He called seas. And God saw that it was good.'' Then, the emotion of the day in his voice, <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> ended the telecast, saying: `` And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a merry Christmas, and God bless all of you, all of you on the good Earth.''

 <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> shuddered. The screening room projector flickered with `` rushes'' of his first day's work in `` Rain Man.'' Fighting off nausea, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> knew his portrayal of an autistic man stank. `` It was death,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> recalled in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was the worst work I had ever done. ... I said, ` I ca n't do it.''' Defeated, the Academy Award-winning actor suggested the producers try <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> instead. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, whose past triumphs include playing a woman in `` Tootsie,'' was stumped by the part of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, a middle-aged autistic savant. In `` Rain Man,'' opening Friday, the long-institutionalized <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> is largely incapable of basic human emotions and speech, but gifted with superior mathematical and memorization skills. It's not an easy part. Having researched autism so intensively he was buried in documents and videocassettes, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, 51, had to dump his notes and observations in his dressing room and, well, act. No plot contrivances offered shelter. As <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> tells it, all he could manage at first was a mish-mash of his past work, mixing bits of the timid, near-sighted prisoner <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> in 1973's `` Papillon'' and the sickly <PERSON> Ratzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON> in `` Midnight Cowboy'' from 1969. Then, three weeks into filming, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and co-star <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> were driving down a bleak highway near tiny <PERSON> Cogar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>. The temperature, over 100 degrees, was matched by the humidity. In a sweat-laced improvisation, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> started talking about how much <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> missed his Hanes underwear. And he just would n't stop. With those cotton briefs, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> figured it all out. `` It looked like to me that you could have talked about your underwear forever,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said director <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> told him. `` And I suddenly realized that yes, this character is in the now, and he is nowhere if he's not in the now. ... `` And I suddenly realized that I was playing off myself because I know something about obsession and I'm comfortable being obsessive. The rest of it just took care of itself.'' `` Rain Man'' tracks <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> -LRB- Cruise -RRB-, a coldhearted schemer whose father dies, leaving him none of the riches he so desperately wishes to inherit. Instead, the $ 3 million falls into a mysterious trust account, which <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> discovers benefits a brother he never knew he had. In an attempt to filch the inheritance and save his bankruptcy-bound car business, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> abducts his newfound brother, and the two set out cross-country, top down, in a 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible, their father's car. In a series of minor incidents along the way, the brothers reach a remote, though improved, understanding of kinship. There are no triumphant scenes of blissful revelation. `` Rain Man,'' whose title comes from <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>'s earliest, dreamy recollections of a shared childhood with <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>, ends quietly. Some might say, indifferently. `` Rain Man'' survived not only <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s panic but also a year of screenplay revisions, the replacement of three directors, the scriptwriters strike and the meddlings of various entertainment industry know-it-alls. It emerges as a modest exploration of greed, communication and familial understanding. `` I did n't think an easy ending was the right way to go,'' said <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, the movie's fourth and final director. `` There had been a bunch of endings where -LRB- the brothers -RRB- were going to live happily ever after, but it did n't seem to apply.'' Added producer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>: `` What we ended up with was much more simple than anything else that existed -LRB- in the scripts -RRB- before.'' It was precisely that intended lack of ornament that proved so elusive. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brest </PERSON> -LRB- `` Midnight Run'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> -LRB- `` E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> -LRB- `` Tootsie'' -RRB- all were in line to direct `` Rain Man'' at one point or another. For a variety of reasons _ some personal, some professional _ the three came and went. But all wanted to dress the story up. One script called for gangsters and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents. Another suggested a big snowstorm. The role of <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>'s girlfriend -LRB- played by <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Golino </PERSON> -RRB- was either too big or not big enough. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> should be more `` retarded.'' Or maybe not retarded at all. Perhaps <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> could become really close at the end? said some. Perhaps not, responded others. `` They -LRB- the assorted kibitzers -RRB- felt that there had to be a jeopardy in the story,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. `` In other words, ` What's going to hold an audience if there's just two schmucks in a car?' <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, the director of `` Good Morning Vietnam'' and `` Diner,'' suspected the audience could be held by just letting the schmucks be schmucks. The final script, turned in by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> just as the five-month <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> strike began, cut most of what <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> considered superfluous. `` I basically wanted to get it down to a conflict between two people on the road,'' <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> said. `` More and more of what we see in the movies are mechanical plots. We pump them up instead of saying, ` Let's just deal with the people.''' <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>'s previous films have been marked by loosely organized stories, and in `` Rain Man'' he predictably chose to let the characters carry the narrative, rather than the other way around. Those familiar with <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON>'s recent work -LRB- `` Cocktail,'' `` Top Gun'' -RRB- might wince at abandoning the 26-year-old actor to his acting skills in such a dramatic role. But Cruise shrugs it off. `` For myself it was a challenge. For myself, it was different. For myself, it was the best role that I've had in my career to date,'' <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> said. `` I do feel that I have a better sense -LRB- of acting -RRB- every time I go on from a picture. You get more confidence _ not cocky, like I know what I'm doing _ but a confidence of trying scenes different ways and not getting locked into one idea of how to play a scene.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, as is his custom, made story suggestions throughout filming. On several occasions, he checked with his autism experts to ensure the film did not `` violate'' the truth, as <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> put it. When the script did n't withstand such challenges, it was revised. Any behavior by <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> that might come across as `` stupid,'' for instance, was excised. Autism, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> was told, is a mental disorder, not retardation. Whether or not such attention to detail will attract audiences remains to be seen. `` You have no idea what the audience is going to think,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. `` Underneath everything, there's a desire to have an impact on the audience. I do n't want them to get up afterward. `` <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said to me when we were doing ` Death of a Salesman,' ` You want to know when the play is really working? When the curtain comes down and you do n't hear anything.'''

 Amid the frozen farm fields of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> answered a cry for help from a small wooden garage. Huddled inside were a mother and three children. They'd lost almost everything _ including their home. They had blankets, beds, a few sticks of furniture and a hot plate, but no bathroom or refrigerator. No money either. Forced off their farm, abandoned by husband and father, the family was struggling to survive. Their predicament is a sad but increasingly common sign of hard times in the heartland. As farmers lose their land, small-town factories shut their doors and housing costs rise, growing numbers of rural folks are joining the ranks of the nation's homeless. `` Rural homeless people are everywhere around us,'' said <PERSON> Louisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless. `` They're living in barns and chicken coops. They're doubled and tripled up with families and friends. They're living under trees or, in some cases, sleeping in caves.'' Garages, too. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> family had rented a nearby house after losing their farm last winter, but when the pipes burst and the landlord could n't afford repairs, they moved into the garage because it was cheaper to warm with a kerosene heater. <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON>, who works for a farmers-assistance group, helped find them a place to stay. They moved on shortly after. People think rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` has been able to stand on its own two feet ever since the Depression,'' <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- They think -RRB- somehow they'll get by. They think you have the white picket fence, mom and dad sit down at the table and eat with the kids. That's not the way it is. `` The reality is urban life and rural life are not much different anymore,'' she added. `` We have people going without food. We have people going without heat.'' And people going without roofs over their heads. Up to 3 million Americans are homeless, the national coalition says. Some experts estimate 10 percent to 20 percent are in rural areas, but nobody knows for sure because they are n't as conspicious as people panhandling on city streets or sleeping on grates. `` Everybody calls the rural homeless invisible. In fact, they are,'' said <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, which deals with rural low-income housing needs. `` They do n't wander the streets of small-town <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Luebke </PERSON>, co-director of the <ORGANIZATION> Welcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transitional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Living </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mankato </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> `` They leave or they somehow hide themselves or hide their problems. They do n't want anyone to know.'' Most of the newest rural homeless are working poor and farm families, says a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Compared with their urban counterparts, the report says, they're younger families dependent on two incomes; typically, one wage-earner loses a job and the remaining income is n't enough to pay the rent. They most often live in counties where employment is dependent on single troubled industries. These people face a <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON>'s choice of moving in with friends or relatives _ or pulling up roots and leaving. The institute's report said some rural areas have a five-year waiting list for public housing. Though their numbers are just a fraction of those in the cities, the rural homeless get much less help _ fewer shelters, fewer soup kitchens, less money from charities. `` In short, the faint voice that has recently been given to the homeless in urban <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has been denied the homeless of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said a national coalition study on such problems in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> and the South. Several studies have examined rural homelessness. Among the findings: _ More than three-quarters of community agencies responding to a <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> survey last year reported increases in rural homeless from 1981-82 to 1986-87. Of those, 38 percent said the increase was significant. _ In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the proportion of women among the rural homeless was twice that of urban homeless populations, according to a 1985 study. That's partly due to the higher percentage of married people among the rural homeless, 18.5 percent against 6.7 percent married among urban homeless. _ In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, 36 percent of adults in shelters and transitional living centers had jobs, compared with 24 percent in urban <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said a 1988 study by the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless. _ In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a study found one of the larger groups in danger of losing homes was farm widows, many of whom live on just a few hundred dollars a month. The count of rural homeless should also include people who live in ramshackle houses or stay with friends and family, a common arrangement among down-and-out farmers, the experts say. It may be 21 people living in one house, nine children and three adults squeezed in a trailer or a family so crowded they sleep in shifts. `` You have people living on top of each other. Those are the hidden homeless,'' said <PERSON> Luebke </PERSON>. `` These people no longer have their own home or apartment. They have a roof over their head, but in real terms they should be considered homeless.'' Living conditions for others are so abysmal that social agencies say it's tantamount to being homeless. `` When people have a home where the roof is constantly leaking and the cold air can come in ... -LRB- and -RRB- there's no money to fix those things, that's not a home,'' said <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Dell </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Bethany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> social service center. Agencies around the country have files on people living in rat-infested shanties, rotting houses without walls or shacks without heat, water or toilets. Others describe a wheelchair-bound man living under a bridge after being evicted, an Indian family sleeping in an old school bus and drawing water from a horse trough, a man who lived in an abandoned refrigerator. <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said she's heard reports from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> of farmworkers living in groves of trees or taking shelter in caves.

 Much of rural homelessness is tied to economics: the slump in the timber, agriculture, mining, meat and energy industries, the loss of manufacturing jobs, farm foreclosures and the ripple effect on Main Street. `` You're dealing with people four or five years ago who would have been middle-class citizens,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, who works at a social service agency in <LOCATION> Mora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> `` They're chronically underemployed. They're not much different than you and I.'' The decade's farm crisis has fueled the decline. The government estimates 274,000 farms disappeared from 1980 through this year, and the number of people living on farms dropped from 6 million in 1980 to 5 million last year. Rural poverty increased by a third from 1978 to 1986, said a report by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based consumer education and research group. In 1986, 9.7 million rural people lived in poverty, the group said. One consequence: people ca n't help themselves, much less each other. `` Although communities very often try to band together to help a person, it's becoming more and more difficult because so many people are suffering,'' <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said. Experts also say pride makes people reluctant to admit their troubles. `` There's a real Midwest ethic: You do n't get it unless you work for it,'' said <PERSON> Ane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, organizer for the <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless. And, she said, `` If you're homeless or destitute in a big city, you can be anonymous. In a small town, you ca n't.'' Often, people hide their problems. `` You try not to let anyone else in the community know just how hard it is,'' said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>, who was homeless a decade ago in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` If you talk about it, it's your personal failure. That's what you believe. You're of pioneer stock. ... You're left with the feeling you've failed to do something that's worked before.'' Even if people acknowledge their problems, help may be many miles away. `` Your survival in the city is easier,'' said <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Budzek </PERSON>, director of a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> shelter. `` If you're hungry, you can walk to the soup kitchen. If you need medical attention, there are shelters in almsot every city across the country. In rural communities, folks are isolated. Even getting to services is real difficult.'' Some places make an extra effort. A program covering 10 northwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> counties tries to ensure food stamps are available to the homeless and those in danger of losing their homes. Small towns in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and other states are setting up shelters and transitional centers. But housing remains a major problem. As far back as 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> And </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 1.8 million members of very low-income rural households were living in severely inadequate or inadequate housing. The problems of rural homelessness have been building for years but only recently are gaining recognition. `` People have already been working on solutions in urban areas the last eight years,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, director of a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgina </LOCATION> center aiding the indigent. `` They've only begun to voice the fact that -LRB- homelessness -RRB- may be in rural areas. `` What we see today as the problem of the urban homeless is probably the tip of the iceberg of what we'd see if we look critically at the rural areas,'' she added. `` The solutions are not as easy to come by. We can not Band-Aid the rural problem at all.... We can not just put people in shelters That's not a solution.'' `` As we begin to undercover more and more, you're going to see a crisis has been there for many years,'' she said. `` It'll only get worse if we do not do something about it.''

 <PERSON> Dwaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Vise </PERSON> rode the rails for years, hopping off in tiny towns, getting drunk by day, going hungry and homeless at night. He slept almost anywhere _ even a morgue. Then he found refuge. It was on a farm, the kind of place where he was raised. When he arrived, Vise had no home, no family and no future. `` They say you've got to hit rock bottom,'' said the ruddy 55-year-old Vise. `` I guess I was damn close. I just found out I had to do something or I was going to die in the street or alleyway.'' Vise lives at Terebinth Farmstead, 54 acres of solace and soil that offer temporary and permanent housing for a small group of men who've lived on the streets for years. Most are recovering alcoholics. Many also were rail riders, sneaking onto freight trains, living in box cars, moving from town to town. The western <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> farm, one of a small number of innovative programs serving the rural homeless, is owned and operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Dorothy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Day </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a short-term shelter in nearby <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON> named after the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> activist and journalist who co-founded The Catholic Worker newspaper. The farm, which opened 17 months ago, follows Day's philosophy: treat the poor with dignity and respect. Terebinth has two purposes, said <PERSON> Barb </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>, the farm's director `` For the long-term guest, it's their home _ a place they can live and die and not drink themselves to death,'' she said. `` For the short-term guys, it's just a safe place to be.'' She said short-termers stay six months to two years. The pastoral setting _ the farm has a barn, lake, cow, rabbits, cats and dogs _ was chosen to get the men, many of whom have rural roots, back to the land. `` There's something about that place that is so healing,'' <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said. `` It's not a place no one else wants. It's a place where we're saying ` We think you deserve the best. We're going to give you the best.' It makes them something other than the least, the waste of society.'' The farm, named after the tree in the Bible under which <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> provided hospitality and shelter for the messengers of God, holds up to 10 men. All must live at the Dorothy Day House before moving to Terebinth. <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON> attracts rail riders because it's on a freight train route. All prospective Terebinth residents with alcohol problems must undergo treatment before they come to the farm. Drinking is taboo there. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said the residents' drinking problems were considered when choosing a location. The nearest tavern is nine miles away. `` You do n't have the temptations you do in town,'' <PERSON> Vise </PERSON> said. `` You feel like you're on your own, not in some institution. There's not someone standing over you You just do your own thing. Out here you can keep busy.'' Some men pick up work at nearby farms. They have a garden, can vegetables and care for the animals. A Dorothy Day staffer lives there full-time. Still, the presence of homeless men _ a few have criminal records _ aroused fierce opposition. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said the program was rejected in three communities before the farm outside <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> was found. The five-bedroom house, replete with fireplace, den and woodshop, is alien to men who've spent years scrounging for food, selling blood to survive and sleeping under bridges, in sawdust piles or hotel bathrooms. Even now, beds, hot meals and a roof do n't guarantee success. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Maio </PERSON>, a Terebinth resident who has been homeless many of his 52 years, has never held a job an entire year. A fifth-grade dropout, he says he has trouble reading and making change. `` It is n't as easy to turn your life around as people think,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Maio </PERSON> said. Some say, `` All you do is get yourself a job. It'll cure your problems. -LRB- But -RRB- you ca n't live on the streets and expect to go to work everyday. You ca n't function well enough.'' The farm `` gives you a good chance to get straightened out,'' he added. `` I hope I do. I think it's going to be mostly up to me.'' Although there's no followup program, <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said about half of those who've left the farm have succeeded in getting on with their lives. For Vise, who came to the farm last summer, it's a fresh start. Vise, who was divorced before his wife died, says he's been in alcohol treatment programs four or five times. He said his life deteriorated when his drinking got out of control. He could n't hold a job and ended up on the streets. He was too proud to panhandle and too embarrassed to let his three children see him. `` When I got sober enough, I realized there was nothing,'' he said. `` No family. No home. No nothing.'' Vise does n't intend to drink again. `` You never say that's it,'' he said. `` I wo n't say I wo n't but I doubt it. I do n't think I'll be on the streets again. I've learned a lot since then. If you want to quit, you can quit. If you can get your self-respect back, then you've got a chance.''

 When it opened, it was a blue and white miracle in concrete and steel, built in a civic frenzy to bring major league sports to the South. Twenty-three years later, <LOCATION> Atlanta-Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> finds itself a pariah among ballparks, a place that both its tenants _ baseball's <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> and football's <ORGANIZATION> Falcons </ORGANIZATION> _ are desperately trying to flee even before the mortgage is paid off. Grumbling about the stadium has gone on for years. The round configuration is n't perfect for baseball, and for football, everyone agrees, it's worse _ when the rectangular field is fitted in beneath the circular stands, the usually desirable 50-yard-line seats are farthest away from the action. Dirty concourses and disgusting restrooms led some in recent years to dub it `` Atlanta-Filthy County Stadium.'' The quality of the playing field has drawn complaints from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> players and opposing teams alike. Narrow concourses leave little room for modern concession areas. Still, the downtown stadium is structurally sound, repainted and looking pretty good, although the restrooms can still get unpleasant. But 1988 may be remembered as the beginning of the end for <LOCATION> Atlanta-Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Falcons </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> insist they will not sign up for another hitch after their leases run out in 1990. It is now possible that within the next decade, the city of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, once home to five major-league sports franchises, will be down to one, its once proud stadium bulldozed and the land sold to pay off the debts. `` I do n't enjoy hearing things like that,'' said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the dynamic mayor of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> from 1961-69 who still boasts of how he and his city built a major league ballpark `` on ground we did n't own, with money we did n't have, for a team we had n't signed. `` I walked around the stadium -LRB- at the Dec. 4 <ORGANIZATION> Falcons </ORGANIZATION> game -RRB- and it was in excellent condition,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said recently. `` It could be used, and be in good shape, for a long time.'' But it appears it wo n't be. In 1986, a civic panel recommended two new stadiums: a domed football arena adjoining the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> World Congress Center convention facility downtown by 1990, and a new baseball park at the present stadium site by'95. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Falcons </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, long fed up with a lease that benefits the <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION>, with a lack of luxury boxes and with the stadium itself, said he would not renew it. Since then <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has, at various times, discussed playing in the proposed `` <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Dome,'' building an open-air stadium near the team's suburban <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> training complex, 30 miles from downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and even moving the franchise to football-hungry <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and its 80,000-seat Gator Bowl. The <ORGANIZATION> Falcons </ORGANIZATION> are gone, concedes <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the stadium authority's executive director since April 1987. `` I'd say so. ... I can understand that the football people here need to leave to get into an environment where they can share in other ... revenues.'' Then, earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> dropped a bombshell: The <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> are n't staying either. The <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION>, he said, are holding `` very serious discussions'' about moving to a proposed state-of-the-art baseball stadium in <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, in a recent interview, said detailing the problems with the stadium would take `` a laundry list.'' He mentioned specifically the lack of modern amenities and the round configuration. `` Can you play baseball there? Sure you can,'' <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> said. `` Can you play football there? Sure you can. `` We just want a better place _ a place that is competitive with the modern-day stadiums, built only for baseball. ... I'm not saying it's unplayable. But we can do better, and if the <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> can, we certainly should pursue that.'' <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> would consider other metro <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> locations, and would probably agree to stay in the current facility until that new downtown baseball stadium _ `` which we were promised, really'' in the 1986 plans _ can be built in the mid-90s. But the proposed $ 159 million football dome remains tangled in financial and political haggling, and the subsequent $ 60 million baseball stadium is not even under serious consideration yet. `` We're interested in getting a new facility,'' <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> said. `` They -LRB- the city and <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -RRB- do n't want to talk about that. So there's not much for us to discuss right now.'' That leaves the <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION>, in <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>'s words, `` very close to getting into substantive, detail-type conversations'' with Gwinnett officials. `` I've been very impressed with the enthusiasm and the spirit I see among the people in <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION>,'' he said. The idea of the <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Falcons </ORGANIZATION> leaving <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has yet to spawn a great public outcry. The two teams have made the playoffs in only five out of their 46 combined seasons in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and cynics suggest the city would n't miss them. And while most <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> officials are backing the dome plan for the <ORGANIZATION> Falcons </ORGANIZATION>, they have n't exactly scurried to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> in the city limits. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> City Council President <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>, while accusing the <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> of racism in wanting to move to the white suburbs, said the city would `` welcome other municipalities within our community to shoulder more of the costs'' of pro sports. Both teams could be gone from the stadium by 1991 _ despite the fact that the debts wo n't be paid off until 2000. The city, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, might wind up selling the land just to pay off the stadium debts: `` The question becomes whether the value of the property is equal to the amount of money owed.'' All of this is a far cry from 1964, when sports in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> meant <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> or minor league baseball's <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crackers </ORGANIZATION>. It was then that ground was broken for the stadium that would propel the city _ literally and figuratively _ into the big leagues. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> at the whip, was built in just 51 weeks, with $ 14 million borrowed from booster-minded bankers. The <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> moved from <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> in 1966; the <ORGANIZATION> Falcons </ORGANIZATION> came that fall. Within six years came basketball's <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION>, who play in The Omni downtown, and hockey's Flames and soccer's <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>, both since departed. `` Twenty-five years after that stadium was built ... it's paid for itself handsomely, with what it's done for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> since then,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` I certainly would have hoped it would have gone on for a much longer time.'' Sports in the suburbs, he said, `` would be better than not having anything.'' But <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> thinks losing either team to the suburbs would be a blow to the city. `` I think its preferable that they stay in the city of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` That's the core of everything.''

<HEAD>Analyst Says Grain Imports Put Financial Burden on Soviet Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The higher cash costs of importing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain and soybeans have caused grumbling among the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s financial planners and are contributing to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s huge economic problems, says an Agriculture Department economist For example, in the first nine months of 1988, about $ 1.2 billion worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain was shipped to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In addition, about $ 362 million worth of soybeans and soybean meal was shipped. In all, counting sales by other countries, the Soviets may spend around $ 16.5 billion on imports of agricultural products this calendar year, up about $ 1 billion from 1987, says <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeimetz </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The bill for grain, the primary farm import for which the Soviets pay hard currency, will increase over $ 1 billion from 1987's $ 2.6 billion, mostly because import prices are up 35 percent,'' she said It is this drain that disturbs <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s planners most. The main source of hard currency for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is from petroleum sales, but oil prices are down and grain prices are up. `` Energy sales to the West usually account for 60 percent of Soviet hard currency receipts,'' <PERSON> Zeimetz </PERSON> said in a recent report. `` Soviet oil export prices in the first nine months of 1988 averaged below 1986. The 15 percent to 20 percent price increase in 1987 was more than lost in 1988.'' <PERSON> Zeimetz </PERSON> said Soviet agricultural import volume in 1989 may be about at the same total level, except that grain imports may be greater. Overall, the cost of imports next year could rise substantially, with grain prices rising by as much as 20 percent, she said. `` The cost of increased agricultural imports _ coupled with relatively low petroleum prices, deteriorating terms of trade, and continued need for non-agricuturl imports _ could make Soviet traders even more exacting in 1989,'' <PERSON> Zeimetz </PERSON> said. Much of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s economic problems stem from a lack of quality food and other consumer goods, massive consumer subsidies for food, and higher wages. As a result, she said, there has been an excess of consumer demand and excess savings, despite both open and hidden inflation. `` The Soviets have maintained the basic prices on most state-distributed foodstuffs at 1962 levels,'' <PERSON> Zeimetz </PERSON> said. `` These have resulted in massive consumer subsidies as production, processing and marketing costs have risen.'' In 1987, the subsidies cost about 60 billion rubles, or $ 94 billion, she said. And they continue to rise. `` Although small cooperatives and individual enterprises are now encouraged, their output of goods and services is not yet significant,'' she said. Meanwhile, the average Soviet's income during the first nine months of 1988 was reported up 9 percent from a year earlier, when the corresponding increase was less than half as much. Deposits in the state savings bank rose 5 percent during the period. <PERSON> Zeimetz </PERSON> said the Soviets `` have built modestly on the 1986 breakthrough in agricultural production, when output increased 7 percent after years of stagnation or decline. Still, per capita production has only regained its 1976-78 average.'' Currently, she said, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s focus is on improving farming practices and management, increasing competition, and raising worker incentives by decentralizing management and financial control. `` Decentralization's newest aim is to establish lease collectives, predominantly on state and collective farms, but also on land outside the socialized farm system,'' <PERSON> Zeimetz </PERSON> said. `` Small groups can lease land from a farm, a government agency or an industrial firm that controls it.'' Although leasing has produced `` phenomenal increases'' in production, efficiency and cost savings, <PERSON> Zeimetz </PERSON> said the results may partly reflect the attention being given the few lease units in operation. <PERSON> Zeimetz </PERSON> said the potential for big gains from leasing is limited by a number of factors: _ Administrator and farm manager resistance to giving up control _ Farm worker reluctance to take risks _ Inadequacies of Soviet farm supplies and infrastructure _ Doubts about the permanence of the lease program _ Lack of prices determined by market demands _ State reluctance to allow large income disparities `` A recent poll showed that only about 15 percent of the adult population favored cooperative and individual labor activities, to which leasing is cl she said. `` Negative attitutes about income disparities have led to vandalism, osely related,'' and are limiting success not only for improved agricultural production but also for food processing and trade, and other consumer goods and services.'' On another front, <PERSON> Zeimetz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has tried to improve the storage, processing and distribution of farm commodities in order to improve the quality of food and reduce losses after harvest, which Soviet officials estimate may exceed 25 percent of the harvest. `` Recently, 70 meat processing enterprises had no refrigerators, and of the 850 refrigerators at other enterprises, 42 percent had been in operation for 20 to 50 years,'' she said. `` Less than 20 percent of Soviet processing machinery was up to world standards, and 60 percent was virtually worn <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the instant she crosses the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, returned to <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> to do another sitcom. A few weeks before CBS decided to take her show off the air, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was interviewed in her trailer parked outside Stage 3 at the <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, the same trailer she used for `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show'' and was also once used by <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>. She's on a couch, wearing a red warm-up suit. Her light brown hair is cut stylishly short. Up close, despite her diabetic condition and too many years spent exposing her skin to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sun, she looks as good as her bank account. She credits this to a change in lifestyle. She has quit smoking, does light impact aerobics and has adopted a healthier diet. In `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> played a woman who works for the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, has a teen-age son and remarries a structural engineer with a son and daughter. She has a mother -LRB- <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckart </PERSON> -RRB- who's an ultra-liberal activist, and her new husband -LRB- <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON> -RRB- has a father -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> -RRB- who's a staunch conservative. The stories were a little different from the usual sitcom fare. In one show she was held up by a man in a wheelchair, then felt obligated to find him a job. In another, her husband admited to having had an affair with his late wife's sister. Once, she had to clear her father-in-law's reputation from an old accusation that food poisoning in his restaurant cost <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> the presidency `` We're breaking a few molds,'' she says. `` We do some outlandish things and conduct ourselves like adults having a great time.'' It was <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s first one-camera show without an audience since she displayed only her legs as `` Sam'' on `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, Private Detective,'' in 1959.

<HEAD>In Eighty Eight, '88 Was the Year of Drought and Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EIGHTY EIGHT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was Eighty Eight's year in'88, when the little farm town with the numerical name found its moment in the spotlight as calendars flipped to 8-8-88. But once Aug. 9 dawned, Eighty Eight got back to the everyday life of'88. And, as in thousands of small towns from coast to coast, 1988 was a year for drought, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the timeless rhythms of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Eighty Eight has neat houses, a grocery, a tire company and two churches stretching about a mile along a two-lane highway. Its 200 residents have no local government, no school, not even a traffic light _ nothing, in short, that would be likely to attract attention. But for a few heady days in August, when the television networks and newspapers and magazines were dispatching reporters and photographers, and thousands of tourists were trooping to town, it seemed the whole world was peeking in on Eighty Eight. `` That was a right exciting thing for this little area,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON>, whose family's lumber mill is the largest local employer. It was also a right unlikely thing. Local residents welcomed all comers with an `` 88 Celebration'' on Aug. 7 and 8. They put on a parade with an 88-year-old grand marshal and cut a cake 8 feet, 8 inches long. They crowded in front of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>'s 88 Market and shouted, `` Good Morning, America!'' for <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. They staged The Wedding of the Century for a <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> couple _ <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Accardo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhlbeier </PERSON> _ at 8:08 p.m. on Aug. 8. Twenty-six thousand pieces of mail got the 8-8-88 postmark. Letters still arrive at the closet-size post office in one corner of the grocery. But for the most part, `` everything is just real quiet around here,'' said <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, the postmistress. `` I'd say in a week everything got back pretty much to normal. That is to say Eighty Eight got back to dairy and tobacco farming, conservative politics and lunch-hour crowds at the 88 Market, where Ms. <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> still serves up hot meals or cold cuts to the <ORGANIZATION> Dickerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> gang and other regulars. It remains a pleasant, unpretentious community. `` People still eat bologna sandwiches,'' said <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON>. `` I know I do.'' Before and after the TV cameras came and went, Eighty Eight mirrored rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In the spring, crops were planted and herds were turned out and folks in surrounding <LOCATION> Barren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s No. 1 dairy producer, looked toward summer. But the rains stopped the first of June, pastures dried up and hay that had been stored for winter feeding had to be hauled out months early. In the fall, hopes rose with the excellence of the burley tobacco crop. At the polls, <ORGANIZATION> Eighty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eight </ORGANIZATION> belied its mostly Democratic registration and helped elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> president. It also sided with voters statewide in approving a constitutional amendment to allow a lottery, although <LOCATION> Barren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> as a whole voted it down. Deep in July, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, accustomed to gambles throughout a lifetime of farming, had to take another. As a crippling drought dragged on and his cattle ate the hay he had planned to feed them in October, Young had to decide whether to follow some of his neighbors and dump his 57 head of dairy and beef cattle on the market. `` I was beginning to think about it,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, 51, `` but I did n't.'' The gamble paid off. The rains returned by the end of July, early enough to coax another crop of hay from the ground and to get his burley _ a dry-weather crop, anyway _ off to a good start. `` This year the tobacco crop has turned out a whole lot better,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who was in a decidely celebratory mood when he helped park cars at the 88 Celebration. `` I thought it was nice. We got a whole lot of recognition,'' he said. `` It wo n't happen for another 100 years. I do n't think I'll be parking cars at that one.'' Forty years ago, voters in Eighty Eight were chronicled by <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON>'s Believe It Or Not when they split in the presidential election _ 88 votes for President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, 88 votes for Republican <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>. This year, the Eighty Eight precinct cast 88 votes for <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Freas </PERSON>, a Democrat from neighboring <LOCATION> Simpson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, in a race for an open state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. Democrats hold a 3-2 registration edge, but Republican <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Barren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> seat, got 231 votes here and won the election district-wide. Nor was <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> daunted by the Democrats' numbers as he lobbied locally for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, which got 216 votes to 147 for the Democratic ticket of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` It's still a rural precinct and the best way to campaign for any candidate is just word of mouth,'' <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> said. `` You have to do a selling job. It was particularly easy this year.''

 Best: _ `` Rattle and Hum,'' U2. An ambitious, important and satisfying record. The Irish superstars swing wildly at numerous musical styles, and more often than not hit the mark in their part-live, part-studio double album. _ `` <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. Stirring songs of love and social conscience from the year's most distinctive new voice. Sets one to wondering if <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> is An Important Artist For The 1990s or a folkie with a few great songs who just got a break. Her big tour did n't answer the question; her next album will. _ `` The <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s Sister,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. A fine comeback by a brilliant artist all but given up for dead. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, one of the'70s finest songwriters, is caustic, as ever, but this literate and listenable record shows more facets of the man than anything he's done in years _ `` Talk Is Cheap,'' <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. No, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> ca n't sing But this is rousing, rocking, flat-out fun _ a raunchy, whiskey-soaked collection of songs with not a single frill attached.

Well, we've always known it's <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, have n't we? _ `` Conscious Party,'' <PERSON> Ziggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marley </PERSON>. The son of reggae legend <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Marley </PERSON> delivers a sparkling debut. <PERSON> Ziggy </PERSON> appears to have his late father's knack for sharp, topical songs that also are danceable.

Is it a commercial? Only his accountant knows for sure. _ `` Heavy Nova,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. He sold his soul for a hit, and this is our payback. _ `` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>.'' Far from the triumphant comeback some proclaimed.

<HEAD>Meager Year for Musicals; Several New Plays Flourished</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was a meager year for musicals, but a half-dozen deserving new plays and several old ones managed to make it to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and flourish during 1988. `` The Phantom of the Opera'' was the year's biggest hit and its best musical. Deservedly so. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> produced his most accomplished score to date _ lush, romantic and sweeping music that perfectly captured <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroux </PERSON>'s passionate tale of love denied. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> was a heart-stopping and heart-breaking phantom, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>'s direction was impeccable, and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjornson </PERSON> provided some eye-popping costumes and scenery. But after `` Phantom,'' which opened in January, nothing else excited the musical theater for the rest of the year. There were minor American musicals like the short-lived `` Mail'' and the two one-act musicals about love operating under the title `` Romance Romance.'' The inevitable turkeys also took to the stage, particularly two British gobblers, `` Carrie'' and `` Chess.'' `` Carrie,'' in particular, signaled that the British musical domination of Broadway was over. The show was an $ 8 million disaster, Broadway's most expensive flop. It was based on the <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> horror novel about a dumpy, awkward teen-age girl with telekinetic powers. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> and 16-year-old <PERSON> Linzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON>, in the title role, sang their hearts out, but nothing could save this dud. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had better luck with plays, particularly new works by American authors. Topping the list, and also taking the Tony award as best play, was `` M. Butterfly,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwang </PERSON>'s brilliant recreation of a spy scandal and love affair involving a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> diplomat and a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> opera singer who turns out to be a man. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON> now plays the diplomat and gives such a compelling, on-the-edge performance that the play seems even better than when it first opened last March. Other notable new works by established playwrights included `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s Come and Gone,'' August <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s story of the search for identity among the children of slaves; <PERSON> Athol </PERSON> <PERSON> Fugard </PERSON>'s `` The Road to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>,'' a tale of one woman's determination to remain independent; `` Speed-the-Plow,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s scathing look at <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> greed and glory, and `` The Cocktail Hour,'' A.R. <PERSON> Gurney </PERSON>'s comic examination of upper-class generational conflict. Lesser-known playwrights also had success. Off-Broadway's `` Reckless,'' by <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, was a biting black comedy about a woman's escape from her family after her husband announces he plans to have her killed on Christmas Eve <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>'s `` Eastern Standard'' offered another fascinating evening. It opens on Broadway Jan. 5, direct from off-Broadway's <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. The play follows several yuppies as they try to grow up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> during the late 1980s. It's a witty, compassionate play about the most disliked group in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Several actors gave memorable performances this year. Among the best: B.D. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, whose gender switch in `` M. Butterfly'' was nothing less than astonishing; <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, the distraught wife in `` Reckless''; <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryceland </PERSON>, the feisty, independent sculptor in `` The Road to Mecca''; <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, oozing an insincere charm as a smarmy would-be <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producer in `` Speed-the-Plow,'' and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchand </PERSON> as a diplomatic and wise WASP matriarch in `` The Cocktail Hour.'' But there were other performances that some actors might want to erase from their Playbill biographies: <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> massacring `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'' in more ways than one; <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, sleepwalking through her role in `` Speed-the-Plow''; and <PERSON> Mariette </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> coming to grief as a grief-stricken queen in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s rarely produced `` King <PERSON> John </PERSON>.'' Most underrated performance: <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brightman </PERSON> in `` The Phantom of the Opera.'' Sure she is n't <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON>, but the woman has a glorious, pristine voice that would be terrific to hear in some classic musical comedy by <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON> or <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> wrote the role of <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> in `` Phantom'' for her. If there's any doubt, listen to the singers who have followed her in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cast. Not even close. Most overrated performances: Four of the five performers in the revival of `` Ai n't Misbehavin'.'' The show should have been called `` Are Misbehavin',' considering the extra histrionics _ vocal and otherwise _ by <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, <PERSON> Armelia </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodard </PERSON>. Only <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> managed to rein in the theatrics. The year produced three exceptional revivals: <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brook </PERSON>'s spare but satisfying version of <PERSON> Chekhov </PERSON>'s `` The Cherry Orchard,'' done by the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s Majestic Theater; <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Casey </PERSON>'s `` Juno and the Paycock,'' in an atmospheric production from the Gate Theater in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>'s dark, brooding version of <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s `` Our Town. Not hitting the mark was the year's most anticipated revival, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s `` Waiting for Godot,'' starring <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and directed by <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The ticket demand was enormous. Most people, including some subscribers to the Lincoln Center Theater, could n't get in, but what they missed was more post-modern burlesque than <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Paralyzing Strike and Furor over `Last Temptation'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Furor over a film about <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, corporate turmoil and a paralyzing strike troubled the movie world in 1988. But it was a year of record prosperity and cautious optimism about the future. Major attractions in the holiday market guarantee that film grosses will pass last year's record of $ 4.85 billion. After a roaring summer and a slight dip after Labor Day, ticket sales boomed over the Thanksgiving weekend with such movies as `` Scrooged,'' `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and Company'' and `` The Land Before Time.'' Two comedies, `` The Naked Gun'' and `` Twins,'' the drama `` Rain Man'' and other December offerings will help swell the year's total, demonstrating anew that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has an almost insatiable appetite for movie entertainment. But not everything in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> was coming up roses. Several film companies that expanded their output when movies started booming five years ago have now run into trouble. <ORGANIZATION> DeLaurentiis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and the Cannon Group suffered heavy losses and were struggling to survive. After venturing disastrously into feature films, <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> hit the skids and merged into <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>. Two of the greatest names of film history, the merged <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, underwent a turbulent year, losing its production heads Producers <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> tried to buy a portion of the company, as did the <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Both deals collapsed. By year's end, the fate of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> was still in limbo The merger of <ORGANIZATION> Tri-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> into a single entity, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, was also in an unsettled state. The company suffered a $ 104 million loss earlier this year, mostly in movie write-downs _ losses from movies that are not released on schedule. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 49 percent of the new company, was rumored to be seeking an exit from the movie business. `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s film about what might have happened if <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> had survived the cross, caused an uproar that is still being played out around the world. Religious fundamentalists staged a huge rally at <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, urging the company to withdraw the film on grounds that it was sacrilege because the movie features a dream sequence in which <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> makes love to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdelene </PERSON>. Universal remained firm, and `` The Last Temptation'' did fair business, hampered by the refusal of some theater chains to book it. The controversy continues as the film moves abroad. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> is the latest country to ban it. Having barely avoided a directors' strike last year, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producers were struck by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in 1988. The strike lasted 22 weeks and ended with a virtual standoff. Feature production did not seem slowed by the walkout, but the opening of the 1988-89 television season was postponed. The colorizing of black-and-white vintage movies continued to rile movie buffs as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and its members, but they could do nothing to stop the televising of tinted versions of `` Casablanca,'' `` Boom Town'' and other classics. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who owns the biggest supply of old movies, even threatened to colorize <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>' 1941 classic, `` Citizen Kane.'' `` The Last Emperor'' was the big winner at the Academy Awards, picking up Oscars for best picture and for <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>'s direction, but for none of the actors The performance awards went to <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> -LRB- `` Moonstruck'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> -LRB- `` Wall Street'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Untouchables'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -LRB- `` Moonstruck'' -RRB-. The once-ailing <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> proved to be the year's success story. With such attractions as `` Three Men and a Baby,'' `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' and `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>,'' Disney deposed Paramount as the top-grossing studio, capturing 20 percent of the market. At year's end, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> announced formation of <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> _ the studio's third movie production company _ to beef up its output of feature films. The new company is scheduled to start up Feb. 1 and to be making 12 movies a year within three years. The new division was conceived as the most efficient way to produce more movies to fill a void left by the failure of some competitors and cuts at others. Not only did Hollywood find comfort in theater business, but the cassette market also continued to boom, as evidenced by the long-awaited release of `` E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.'' <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>'s first shipment was a record 10.6 million units. That was more than twice as many as the previous record holder, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cinderella.''

 What finally became of <PERSON> Putu </PERSON> and Siku, those celebrated whales? What is the truth about the Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>? Who bombed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s motorcade? As 1988 draws to a close, some nagging questions remain unanswered:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE WHALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 On Oct. 7, a hunter off <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, discovered three <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales trapped by early Arctic ice. In an expensive international operation, <ORGANIZATION> Eskimos </ORGANIZATION> cut breathing holes for the whales with chain saws, and two Soviet icebreakers cleared a channel for the whales to start their trip back to open water. One of the whales apparently died in the process. The weary survivors, dubbed Siku -LRB- Ice -RRB- and <PERSON> Putu </PERSON> -LRB- Ice Hole -RRB-, faced a swim to the open sea of 200 ice-clogged miles, to join 21,000 fellow grays migrating 5,000 miles to warmer waters off <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The whales have n't been seen again and are unlikely to be spotted, but hope is high for their survival. `` They had the will to live,'' says rescue coordinator <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. `` They should make it.''

<HEAD>THE SHROUD OF TURIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Science heightened the mystery surrounding the Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> Oct. 13 when the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> announced that, according to lab tests, the cloth is no more than 728 years old and can not be the burial cloth of Christ. The linen strip, 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide, bears the faded image of a scourged and crucified man. Scientists say they have determined the shroud was not the product of an artist, but do not know how the haunting image was made. Those who believed it was Christ's burial cloth had attributed the image to a sudden blaze of light, fitting Biblical accounts of the resurrection. Others suspect radiation, or an unexplained chemical reaction between body secretions and the cloth. The bishop, <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Balestrero </PERSON>, says carbon-14 tests on tiny samples date the cloth to between 1260 and 1390. Although critics are now quick to brand the linen a medieval fake, the church says the cloth continues to be a venerated symbol of faith, and the mystery of its origin remains.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> escaped unharmed Aug. 8 when a bomb exploded near his motorcade as he traveled to downtown <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, from a nearby airport. The blast tore up pavement, damaged three cars and blew out the car window next to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s wife. No one was hurt. <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> investigators said they believe a radical leftist group, the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bolivar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commando </ORGANIZATION>, was involved. Little is known about the group, which claimed responsibility for targeting <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> during his 10-day Latin American tour. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was investigating the attack but said it would not release its findings.

<HEAD>THE CRUISE SHIP ATTACK</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 On July 11, terrorists fired guns and hurled grenades aboard the Greek cruise ship City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION>, killing nine people and injuring 98 other passengers returning from a day-long cruise on the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> concluded that the Abu Nidal Palestinian group probably mounted the attack, but the organization denied responsibility. Anonymous callers claimed responsibility for a variety of other groups. One theory was that the terrorists may have been seeking freedom for <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, a Palestinian jailed in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> for entry on a forged Syrian passport. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> is wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on charges he planted a bomb on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet in 1982 that killed one person and injured 15.

<HEAD>THE KUWAIT HIJACKING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Kuwaiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet with 112 passengers and crew was hijacked April 5 on a flight from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and rerouted to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Two Kuwaitis were killed before the last hostages were freed in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> as the 16-day ordeal reached a negotiated end. Western intelligence sources said the nine hijackers were believed to be pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems of the Lebanon-based <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. But the identities of the hijackers were never revealed. One published report said the hijackers were flown from <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and later reached <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by land. There was no independent confirmation, but one diplomat, insisting on anonymity, said, `` The men are believed to have gone underground with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in a largely Shiite part of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> where their trail is easily lost.''

<HEAD>THE ZIA CRASH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A Pakistani military plane crashed just after takeoff Aug. 17 near <LOCATION> Bahawalpur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, killing President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and 28 others. A Pakistani report shed little light on who may have been responsible for what investigators concluded was probably an act of sabotage. The report ruled out accidental technical failure aboard the sturdy C-130 transport, and said investigators found no evidence of an anti-aircraft missile or a powerful bomb. But investigators discovered residues of chemicals that could be used in an explosive strong enough to cause a technical malfunction. If it was sabotage, suspects included agents of Soviet-allied <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, angered by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s support for Afghan rebels; Pakistani ethnic or religious minorities; or agents of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which has fought three wars with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> have denied any involvement. Some published reports suggested that if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is implicated, neither <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> will want to make such charges public, in order to avoid a confrontation.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two governments, deciding to deal, won freedom for the last of their hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1988. But 16 other Westerners remained captive, among them nine Americans. And late in the year President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acknowledged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, too, may have to deal. `` We're looking at every channel that we can find to try and get them -LRB- hostages -RRB-, and I imagine that the ultimate is going to have to be somehow a negotiation with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, because they have control of -LRB- the kidnappers -RRB-,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chief executive told a news conference. Political and military developments in the region brightened the outlook for the release of remaining hostages, most of whom are believed held by Lebanese Shiite Moslem groups under the influence of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, Iranian moves to improve diplomatic relations with the West, and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s moves to curb pro-Iranian Shiites in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> _ all combined to alter the backdrop to the long-running hostage drama. Both <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> successfully negotiated with the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government over the past two years to free all 13 French and West German hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Among those released in 1988 were Frenchmen <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, and West German <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>. The French government denied it made any deals. But informed sources in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> agreed to restore diplomatic relations and repay $ 400 million to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, final segment of a $ 1 billion loan made by the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. The sources also said $ 10 million, channeled through an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> businessman, was paid to two terrorist factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The West Germans, who have good contacts with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, also denied they made any deals. But informed Arab sources said millions of dollars were paid into Swiss bank accounts, sanctioned either by the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government or the major firms employing two of the German captives, to secure the men's release. Iranian leaders said several times recently that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> would use its influence with the kidnappers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to free their American captives if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> released Iranian assets worth several billion dollars, assets frozen in 1979. Until his Dec. 8 news conference, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had publicly rejected any linkage between the hostages and Iranian assets, and dismissed the notion of negotiation. The longest-held of the nine Americans is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
 If projections by the nation's train, air and bus lines are any indication, more Americans than ever will be traveling during the Christmas and New Year's holidays in 1988. Greyhound, the nation's largest intercity bus line, says it will carry 1.34 million passengers between Dec. 18 and Jan. 3, or 10 percent more than the 1.2 million people transported during the holidays last year. In part, the bus line attributes the increase to a recent boost in air fares and the limited availability of discount-priced seats on the nation's major airlines, said Greyhound Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Currey </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> on Tuesday to meet with company employees. `` Airplane ticket prices are very substantially higher this year, and they are a factor,'' <PERSON> Currey </PERSON> told reporters. `` And bus fares are very moderately priced.'' <PERSON> Currey </PERSON>'s contention was disputed by organizations representing airlines and the nation's travel agents. `` Most people buying at Christmas bought their tickets weeks and months ago before fares went up,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidoff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Belair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowie </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, president-elect of the travel agents' group. `` What's going to happen next year, I do n't know. If the increases are put into effect for January, it probably will mean more people will take buses than ever before.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the nation's largest airlines, said a record 7 million Americans traveled by air during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Between Dec. 17 and Jan. 2, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines expect to transport at least 22 million people, or about 500,000 more than for the same period last year, he said. That would also be a record, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. The nation's major airlines announced last month that they were boosting most of their lowest discount fares and eliminating the cheap fares that can be booked a few days before a flight. But a week later, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> airlines announced reductions in some of their fares. `` Those fare increases that were announced just prior to Thanksgiving affected a very small percentage of the travel market,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, public relations manager for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passenger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, better known as <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, said the railroad carried a record number of passengers in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 and `` it shows no signs of letting up.'' But limited capacity makes it difficult for the railroad to set holiday records, he said. `` During the holiday seasons, they tend to sell out, making it impossible to improve from year to year and from one holiday season to the next,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Yatteau </PERSON>, Greyhound regional manager in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said he expects 38,300 Greyhound tickets to be sold in the state for the Christmas-New Year's season. That would be an increase of 12 percent over a year ago. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said space is limited on most <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> trains traveling from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> this holiday season. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> trains traveling from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Dec. 23 already are sold out, he said.

 Inspired by better snowmaking technology and growing attendance, ski resorts in the Northeast are spending millions of dollars in what industry officials call the region's greatest expansion since the 1960s The smaller, forested slopes of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> also have embarked on a marketing campaign designed to persuade skiers that skiing here is just as good as in the wide-open slopes of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>. `` The weather's been good and snow conditions have been favorable,'' said <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Conniff </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Areas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` As a result, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> ski-area operators have been plowing quite a bit of money into new equipment.'' In the country's largest skiing development project this year, <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> is spending $ 30 million to make the resort set 10 miles inside a national forest the `` Aspen of the East.'' <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION> is adding restaurants, boutiques, tennis courts and a high-speed detachable chair lift that cuts the trip to the top of the mountain in half. It has 30 new acres of slopes and snowmaking equipment to cover 96 percent of the trails. `` It's really an economic window of opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiedaisch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>'s vice president. `` We've always had a pent-up market but we wanted more capacity. We were often maxed out in our capacity.'' In other recent developments: _ <LOCATION> Stratton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> spent $ 4.5 million to install the largest ski lift in the country, a 12-passenger gondola able to carry 2,400 people an hour _ <LOCATION> Burke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Burke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, is making more than $ 1 million in improvements to the 25-year-old ski area, including construction of 100 condominiums and a 20 percent expansion of snowmaking capabilities _ <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peak </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bridgton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, is spending about $ 1.2 million to stimulate a money-losing operation by adding new lifts, rental equipment, more lodge space and lights that will make it the largest night skiing resort in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> _ After a $ 1.5 million overhaul, Ski Adventure in <LOCATION> Ashby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, is expected to reopen in December, six years after the old <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Watatic </LOCATION> ski area went bankrupt and closed The 185 ski areas in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> led the nation in expansion this year, spending $ 60.9 million on improvements, compared with $ 56 million spent by <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> resorts and $ 51 million in <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> ski areas, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Areas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In 1987, Northeast ski areas spent $ 92.1 million, 2 -LCB- times the 1985 level. Last year, the eight states in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> reported about 15 million skier visits, compared with 17 million in the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>. In the 1984-85 season, attendance was less than 12 million in the East. The East has a basic topographic disadvantage because its tallest mountains are less than half the size of the 10,000 - to 12,000-foot peaks found in the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> is the region's tallest mountain at 6,200 feet. The <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> also offer complete resort areas with open skiing in wide, snowy fields. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, most trails are cut through woods and ski areas are typically limited to lodges and have few other recreational opportunities. To meet the competition, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> skiing associations have expanded on a national campaign _ `` Let's Go Skiing America'' _ by pushing for vacations at local resorts and trying to broaden modest increases in attendance over the last two years. `` It's not because they're losing market share to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> or some non-ski service,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Camp </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Areas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group. `` The rate of growth of the consumer market in skiing has not been rapid like it was 15 or 18 years ago.'' In <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, ski areas are teaming up to make the state's resorts a destination. One new program allows interchangable lift tickets at Smugglers, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Peak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Sugarbush </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Areas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> this year also began coordinating fly-drive packages from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to build on the state's traditional bases of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. More man-made snow is being poured on slopes earlier than ever. A 2-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> product called Snomax allows snow to be made at temperatures 4 degrees to 8 degrees warmer than before, as high as freezing. Thanks to more sophisticated snowmaking, <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> said more than 50 of the 72 public ski areas in the six-state <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> region were open last weekend, a `` quantum leap'' over previous years. Said <PERSON> Conniff </PERSON>: `` The technology that's come along has taken a lot of the risk out of the business in the last three or four years.'' The onset of cold weather also has encouraged area ski officials hopeful that single-digit temperatures will persuade city dwellers to head for the slopes. `` The most important thing this cold weather has given us is an unprecedented jump on snowmaking efforts,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemel </PERSON>, general manager of the Powder Ridge Ski Resort in <LOCATION> Middlefield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` More slopes are opening faster than I've ever seen in the seven years I've been here.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is facing renewed pressure from financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who has raised his stake in the third-biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company and has n't discouraged speculation he might resurrect a failed takeover bid. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> stoked the smoldering takeover speculation about <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, disclosing he had increased his stock ownership to 15.8 percent of the company's 240 million shares outstanding. Securities analysts said <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s move, which helped boost <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price, evidently reflected his impatience at the pace of the company's post-bankruptcy restructuring aimed at increasing the value of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock. Some said <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, probably had no interest in acquiring the company himself but might be attempting to induce another investor to make an offer. `` I think ultimately he's looking for a way to cash in,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaspar </PERSON>, who follows <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> for the Milwaukee-based investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think he's trying to stir up the pond and attract some outside interest to take a look at <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>.'' Others did not rule out the possibility of a takeover attempt by <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who began acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock while the company was under federal bankruptcy court protection a year ago. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> declined to comment on why he raised his stake. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> officials also declined to comment. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 87 -LCB- cents a share Tuesday to $ 51.62 -LCB- in heavy trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, an indication that investors believe either <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> or someone else may try to win control of the company. Last spring, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> made an offer for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> valued at $ 14.5 billion, or $ 60 a share, as part of a shareholder proxy fight to oust the company's board. But his strategy was defeated by shareholders loyal to the board, which promised to boost <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price through an aggressive restructuring But since then, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock has not risen significantly, raising the possibility that more shareholders would align themselves with <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> if he undertook another takeover attempt. Moreover, some analysts said, the idea that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> could raise the financing for such a takeover is not far-fetched. `` Last spring, nobody believed anybody could raise $ 14 or $ 15 billion for an acquisition,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aydin </PERSON>, an oil securities analyst at the Cleveland-based investment firm <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` This year it's different.'' The most notable example is the record $ 24.53 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by the buyout firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced less than two weeks ago. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that he purchased 2.6 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> between Dec. 7 and Dec. 12 for about $ 131 million, or an average of $ 50.37 -LCB- a share. Some <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> analysts and takeover attorneys thought <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s move signaled he was not interested in buying the company, because it vaulted his stake over a 15 percent threshold that under some circumstances triggers the anti-takeover laws of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> would have to immediately raise his ownership to 85 percent or wait at least three years before attempting any hostile acquisition that would result in the company's breakup, attorneys familiar with the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law said. His latest move came against a background of resurgent rumors that he was growing exasperated with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s multibillion dollar asset-shedding program and the company's failure to specify the date of a promised $ 1.7 billion distribution to shareholders. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of his successful acquisitions. He widely is regarded as a shrewd financier and takeover investor and has gone after some of the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations, such as <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He has been a thorn in the side of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> management, which has been preoccupied with restructuring the company since it emerged from bankruptcy protection several months ago after settling a multibillion dollar dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>IBM Announces Rolm Sale-Venture With Germany's Siemens</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is reducing its role in the telecommunications equipment business by selling part of its money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION> operation to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> and putting the rest of <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION> into a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>. The deal announced Tuesday marks another chapter in <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s mixed success with <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION>, a freewheeling <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> company that the computer giant bought four years ago for an estimated $ 1.5 billion to help it link computers through phone switches. <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION> is believed to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years, but has grown into the nation's biggest seller of office phone switches _ which route calls within buildings _ under <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s ownership. The purchase would make <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> the world's biggest seller of office phone switches. <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> could consolidate its lead if it manages to buy <ORGANIZATION> Italtel </ORGANIZATION>, an Italian phone company, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for which it is making a $ 3.1 billion hostile offer in cooperation with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> The price <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> is paying was not disclosed, but <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said the deal would have no material effect on its income statement when it is completed early next year. That was taken as positive news for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, because there had been speculation the sale price would be so low that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> would be forced to take a large writeoff. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said, `` I would absolutely not characterize it as a scaling back of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s interests in telecommunications. He said the combination with <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> would allow <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> to offer a wider range of products to its customers than before. But analysts said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is turning over all responsibility for development and manufacture of Rolm-branded products to <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> and is discontinuing work on a complex office switch for the European market. `` For <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, it's a very clean market exit,'' said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON> of Northern Business Information-Datapro in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It is a graceful but not total retreat, no matter how you cut it,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbetta </PERSON>, a researcher for <ORGANIZATION> Probe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knolls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> will sell the development and manufacturing arm of <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION>, with its 2,800 employees, to <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>. It will become <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and include 700 employees now working for <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> jointly will own a marketing and services company, known simply as <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION>, that will offer telecommunications products for private networks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It will have 5,500 employees who currently work for <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION> and fewer than 100 now working for <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> gradually will phase out a <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION> manufacturing and development plant in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and offer jobs elsewhere in the company to the 550 affect employees. Those who do not accept transfers will be offered severance packages. Under <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s ownership, <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION> has lost money steadily, but its share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market has risen to 18.1 percent from 14.2 percent in 1984, according to Northern Business Information-Datapro. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> had bought <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION> as insurance in case the trend in computers was to connect them through office phone switches, according to <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosomworth </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. Instead, most office computers are connected through special local area networks, an area in which <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is also strong. <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION> was vulnerable to competition because it does not make switches for the central offices of phone companies, in contrast to competitors such as <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bosomworth </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> does make central office switches. Phone networks are being redesigned to handle computer data and video signals as well as voice traffic, and companies that make central office switches are at the cutting edge of work in the field, <PERSON> Bosomworth </PERSON> said. In a sign of the importance the companies attached to the deal, it was announced jointly at a news conference by <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, who rarely appears at press conferences, and <PERSON> Karlheinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaske </PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION> has development and manufacturing operations in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> has telecommunications development operations in <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and manufacturing in <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The companies said <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> would be headquartered in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, and would be expanded to include about 700 <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> employees based in <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Rolm </ORGANIZATION>, the marketing company, will be based in the <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, area and will include fewer than 100 people now working for <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> in addition to the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> employees.

 The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest company, resigned Wednesday under fire for alleged involvement in a scandal that has spread wide tentacles through <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s political and business world. The minister of posts and telecommunications, <PERSON> Masaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON>, told a news conference he had accepted the resignation of <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> chairman. <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> said Shinto had denied any personal involvement in dubious share trading but had accepted responsibility for actions by his personal secretary. Japanese press reports said prosecutors had traced some 10 million Japanese yen, or around $ 81,000, to Shinto's bank account from proceeds of the sale of shares in <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate subsidiary of the Recruit conglomerate. Shinto on Tuesday had issued a statement denying involvement in the share transaction, which was carried out by his personal secretary, <PERSON> Kozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murata </PERSON>, in 1986. <PERSON> Murata </PERSON> has since resigned as Shinto's aide. The so-called Recruit scandal last week brought the resignation of <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> as finance minister and deputy prime minister, and has rocked the Japanese political and business worlds with allegations that the Recruit company was seeking favors by distributing shares in Recruit-Cosmos with a guarantee of easy, tax-free profits. <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>, ranked as the largest corporation in the world in terms of stock market capitalization, had business links with Recruit, which bought two U.S.-made supercomputers from <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> and leased data communications circuits from the telephone giant. As a former telecommunications monopoly, <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> has been partially privatized, but Shinto and all other officials of the utility remain under regulations which make it illegal for them to receive cash or shares from private companies that <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> does business with. Shinto has been the chief executive of the telecommunications giant since 1981, when <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> was still a government-owned monopoly. He oversaw the privatization, which started in 1985, and then took the title of president. He held that post until last June, when he became chairman and chief executive, and the title of president went to <PERSON> Haruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>. Shinto's resignation would make him the most prominent victim in the business world of the Recruit scandal, which has also brought the resignation of news media executives and has broken several political careers in addition to that of <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, who a year ago was a major contender to be prime minister. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is on a list of prominent politicians whose aides profited from owning <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares, but he and the others denied any knowledge or involvement in the transactions. Among the others are former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, secretary-general of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The roots of the scandal go back to 1986 when unlisted <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares were offered to the prominent figures or their aides, often to be paid for with loans from a Recruit-linked finance company. The shares were listed for sale in the over-the-counter market in October 1986 and immediately skyrocketed in value, yielding tax-free profits when they were sold.

 The first fiber-optic telephone cable across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> goes into service Wednesday, greatly increasing the number of calls that can be placed to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at one time, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in Wednesday's editions, says the new cable can carry 40,000 calls simultaneously by using pulses of laser light to send voice and computer data.

 The nation's retailers lost nearly $ 2 billion last year to theft and errors, including shoplifters, whose top three light-finger items were ladies' apparel, consumer electronics and recordings, according to a new survey. `` An Ounce of Prevention,'' the 10th annual survey of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailers by the <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> accounting firm, said Tuesday that jewelry, shoes and men's clothing were at the bottom of the list. `` Our survey shows that many of the nation's retailers have been hit hard by theft and other losses,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION>'s retail group in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a management consultant for the retail industry. The survey found companies lost $ 1.8 billion through shoplifting, theft by employees or vendors and errors in paperwork in 1987, compared with $ 1.5 billion in losses in 1986. The survey covered 119 retail companies operating in 47,000 locations around the country with combined total sales of $ 127.5 billion, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The research was conducted last spring and summer. Companies participating in the survey included discount stores, department stores and specialty stores. The names of the firms were withheld. Discount stores were hit hardest last year, losing $ 1.2 billion worth of merchandise while department stores lost $ 364 million and specialty shops lost $ 233 million worth of goods, the survey said. For the five years from 1982 through 1987, the survey found the following increases in shoplifting losses as a percentage of total sales: _ Discount stores: from 1.5 percent to 2.1 percent _ Specialty stores: from 1.7 percent to 2.2 percent _ Department stores: from 2 percent to 2.1 percent The survey showed that 86 percent of department stores ranked ladies' apparel as the first or second areas hardest hit by shoplifters. `` There was a time when calculators were the hot items for shoplifters, then it went to designer jeans, now it's designer lingerie,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Shealy </PERSON>, vice president of loss prevention for <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION>'s, a department store chain. `` It's the highest theft department in the company,'' he said. `` We began putting designer lingerie in the department about two years ago and this year most of the merchandise is designer.'' Since then, inventory loss in the lingerie department nearly tripled, <PERSON> Shealy </PERSON> said, declining to provide specific figures. `` We have suede bras and panties costing more than $ 400,'' he said. `` These designer items are ` got ta have but ca n't afford' things and it's easy for a shoplifter to put a dozen bras or panties in a large handbag `` It's a combination of the designer label and the price that excites them,'' he said.

 The Premier `` smokeless'' cigarette is drawing less than rave reviews from some smokers and retailers, but <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is not ready to scrap a two-state test of the product's popularity Despite consumer complaints about everything from the cigarette's taste and smell to its price and unusual construction, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> claims Premier had `` the highest initial trial rate of any brand in recent history, probably due to the amount of publicity that it received. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said there are no plans for ending the test run of the revolutionary high-tech cigarette introduced two months ago in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. But the company said it had no figures on sales or consumer acceptance of the device, which heats tobacco to release the flavor but does not burn it. Negative consumer reaction is only one of the problems plaguing Premier's test run. Public health advocates have called on the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to regulate the product as a drug. A still greater threat to the product may lie in <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed $ 24.53 billion leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has said Premier could cost $ 1 billion from drawing board to nationwide distribution. Analysts believe that the high debt costs of the buyout puts Premier's future in jeopardy. If the test-marketing lags, they say the new owners would be more likely to allow the product to go up in smoke. Stores in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, where Premier was introduced in October say the smokeless cigarette is not catching on with consumers. `` They're terrible. They're nasty. They're beyond nasty,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON>, an employee at a 7-11 store in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. `` I would n't have them here on a death wish,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Meister </PERSON>, manager of a south <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> Tinder Box shop. `` My representative suggested them, but people try them and they do n't want them.'' Smokers who have tried Premier are convinced the new product will attract few converts. They say it's not so much the higher price for Premier _ 30 to 50 cents more per pack than regular cigarettes _ or the annoying fact that they burn themselves out if left unattended. The worst reviews come from the taste. But RJR officials say they are not discouraged. New videos which promote the product's lack of sidestream smoke are being sent to stores in the distribution chain, Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said. They are not part of a crash program to save Premier, but instead are one of several phases in the advertising campaign, she said. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to test-market Vantage Excel 100s, a reduced-smoke cigarette, in January also is unrelated to reports of Premier's troubles, Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said One of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s key marketing assumptions was that consumers would be so attracted to a low-tar cigarette that was less offensive to non-smokers that they would take time to acquire a taste for the new product. But people are not buying the two or three packs the company believes is needed to get used to the differences in taste, aroma and experience. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, regional marketing director for Phoenix-based <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> sale figures through the chain of convenience stores were confidential, but he characterized them as modest. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinck </PERSON>, who manages a 7-11 store in downtown <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, said he took on an inital inventory of 10 cartons and had sold three packs, leaving 97 on the shelves. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, manager of a Tinder Box store in west <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said he stocked Premier initially but would n't reorder them. `` It seems like every sale is a one-shot deal,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen today, while share prices rebounded on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid optimism about an impending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report, dealers said. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which dropped 74.48 points Tuesday, gained 156.92 points, or 0.53 percent, finishing at 29,754.73. The rebound followed the dollar's firming on the currency market as traders anticipated a narrowing of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for October, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage. `` The dollar's uptrend encouraged stock investors to buy export-related issues such as <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON>,'' said the dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the same optimism first had pushed up the dollar on the currency market, prompting the Nikkei to rise. `` Investors are now expecting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit to shrink to about $ 9.5 billion,'' he added. September's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit was $ 10.46 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was to release the nation's trade figures for October later Wednesday. Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 1 billion shares. On the currency exchange market, the dollar closed unchanged from the opening at 123.35 yen, up 0.29 yen from Tuesday's close of 123.06 yen. The currency moved in a tight range of 123.25-123 .45 yen A <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> dealer said a majority of traders remained on the sidelines to await the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report. `` The dollar-yen rate today was barely moving in a cautious mood,'' he said, adding that there was no other news to affect market trends. If the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit matches market expectations of about $ 10 billion, the dollar-yen rate is unlikely to change soon from the current level, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the first <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convened in 1789, members were paid $ 6 a day _ while in session. Lawmakers created a furor 27 years later when they decided to boost their pay to $ 1,500 a year, a raise that was quickly repealed. Two centuries after the first session the debate continues, with many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> complaining that their $ 89,500 salary is too small and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> considering whether to offer them a sizeable raise. Consumer advocates such as <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> were quick to criticize when a presidential commission on Tuesday suggested a 50 percent pay hike for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other top federal officials, but former Rep. <PERSON> Elford </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cederberg </PERSON>, R-Mich., was more sympathetic <PERSON> Cederberg </PERSON>, who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Former </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressmen </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, and more importantly the folks back home, often do n't realize the high cost of maintaining households both at home and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he estimated that lawmakers' houses cost an average of $ 250,000. `` The average person back home just does n't understand that if a man brings his family with him down here, unless he has some personal wealth, it's difficult for him to take on that kind of a mortgage,'' <PERSON> Cederberg </PERSON> said. `` Especially in politics, which is a rather unstable business.'' When <PERSON> Cederberg </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he was paid $ 12,500. The annual salary had climbed to $ 57,500 when he was voted out of office in 1978 after serving 13 terms. He said he makes more money now as a consultant. Winning influence also takes a toll on congressional wallets, <PERSON> Cederberg </PERSON> said. `` Republicans belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and Democrats belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` And there are other people and things you have to be seen around if you're going to be influential and they cost money.'' The new recommendations, from a commission that weighs in with its views on congressional pay after every presidential election, would raise the salaries to $ 135,000 _ more than nine times the nation's average personal income in 1987. Such comparisons are dismissed by proponents of pay hikes, who point to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s high cost of living. And, just like the folks back home, many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have to worry about babysitters and tuition for their children, they say. `` I think some people think that congressmen and their wives go around in limousines and live in big houses and go to the White House,'' said <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Poston </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm for social events and conventions. `` That's just not the day-to-day life.'' Ms. <PERSON> Poston </PERSON>, who was social secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and their spouses also are expected to entertain and attend formal functions. `` They are supporting two households and worrying about babysitters and at the same time they are invited out and asked to do so many things,'' she said. `` They are expected to be all things to all people.'' Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are reluctant to vote themselves a pay hike, and wo n't necessarily have to if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accepts the commission's findings or recommends smaller raises If no vote is taken, the raises take effect automatically. `` You've got an electorate that loves to take a bite out of your leg,'' former Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Tenn </LOCATION>., said last month as he nonetheless urged the commission to reward lawmakers with higher pay `` There's nothing closer to home than examining the pay of public officials.'' Critics such as <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> scoff at the reasons listed by pay hike proponents. `` Money does not buy integrity, dedication and agreement,'' he says. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> surely would agree. But they might quickly add: It does buy a house. Or two. Supporting the higher pay can also buy trouble, a fact not lost on the lawmakers. `` My appearance here kicks off my opponent's next campaign, whoever he or she is,'' Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., joked last month when he urged the commission to recommend higher pay Others argue that more money should come with the prestige of serving in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, D-Mo., complained during a 1987 debate on congressional pay that his pipefitter brother made more money Said Clay: `` I think something is amiss.''

 Here is a summary of the major recommendations of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Executive, <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salaries </ORGANIZATION>, which will be formally forwarded to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Thursday: _ Salaries for the top 2,500 federal officials _ including the vice president, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, judges, cabinet members and other senior exective-branch personnel _ should be increased by roughly 50 percent in 1989 That amount would restore purchasing power of those officials to 1969 levels. A member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, for example, would go from a salary of $ 89,500 to $ 135,000, as would district judges. The vice president's salary would go from $ 115,000 to $ 175,000. _ <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should enact separate legislation to raise the president's salary, which has been frozen at $ 200,000 since 1969, to about $ 350,000 The increase could not take effect until Jan. 21, 1993, because of a constitutional ban on raising a president's pay during his term. _ <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should pass legislation to abolish honoraria, the speaking and writing fees paid to lawmakers primarily by special-interest groups The ban should go into effect at the same time the pay raise is effective. The commission's report is only a recommendation. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may adopt or modify it when he submits his budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 9.

 Share prices were lower in quiet trading at midday Wednesday amid nervousness ahead of the afternoon release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for October. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 9.1 points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,743.5 at about 12:30 p.m., just 0.4 point above its worst level of the morning. The index touched its best level, 3.2 points up, shortly after the opening. Shares opened on a positive note, as prices maintained the upward momentum seen Tuesday in what dealers called a technical rebound following the market's recent sharp falls. They were also boosted by news of a surprise drop in British industrial production which could indicate a slowing in demand and an easing of inflationary pressures. But sentiment was then hit by concerns that the recent hikes in British interest rates, and the strong pound, are hurting corporate profits. Traders also were nervous ahead of the 1:30 p.m. release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures. Volume was light, with 263.6 million shares changing hands by midday compared with 287.8 million shares at the same time Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s central bank boosted all key banking interest rates by 0.25 percentage points Wednesday, reflecting the growing trend toward higher rates in the international markets. The Belgian <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wednesday </ORGANIZATION> said the discount rate was raised to 7.5 percent and the Lombard rate to 7.75 percent. The discount rate is the interest the central bank charges on loans to member commercial banks. The Lombard rate is what the banks are charged for supplemental borrowings in which securities are used as The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> had announced earlier it was raising one -, two - and three-month treasury The three-month rate, considered the most important in Belgian banking, was raised to 7.4 percent from 7.15 percent, the one-month rate to 7.35 from 7.1 percent and the two-month rate to 7.4 from 7.15 percent. All the moves take effect on Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said the rate changes came `` in recognition of the recent evolution of interest rates on the international markets.'' Short-term rate levels have been rising in recent weeks in many industrial countries, prompting speculation that both the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might raise key rates soon.

<TEXT>
 The chairman of the world's largest company resigned today, becoming the most prominent business victim in a scandal that also has brought the downfall of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s finance minister. <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, 78, head of the telecommunications giant <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> since 1981, formally resigned to the minister for posts and telecommunications, <PERSON> Masaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> told a nationally televised news conference that Shinto had said he had n't personally been involved in dubious share trading but was resigning to take responsibility for transactions by his then-personal secretary. On Friday, Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> resigned, giving up the post of deputy prime minister as well, because of a similar link to the scandal involving the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information-based conglomerate that did business with Nippon, the national telephone utility. Shinto said in a brief statement, `` I have decided to resign to take responsibility for causing trouble concerning <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> and the Recruit affair and causing people to lose trust in <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>.'' Aides to Shinto, <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> and other prominent people in politics and business received unlisted shares in <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, at bargain prices or with Recruit-backed loans. They then sold the shares after they were offered to the public in October 1986 and the price more than doubled. The transactions were not illegal, but in the political cases they have brought stern criticism of the links between politics and big business. <PERSON> Haruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was visibly shaken at the news conference, where he said Shinto's secretary had complete control of the bank account in question `` -LRB- Shinto -RRB- said the transaction may have taken place but he could not confirm it because -LRB- the secretary's -RRB- whereabouts are unknown,'' <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who also had a former aide on the list of Recruit's beneficiaries, says he will launch political reforms to try to rebuild public trust in government. Japanese law forbids officials of a quasi-governmental corporation like <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> from receiving personal donations from private firms with which their company does business. Press reports quoted prosecutors as saying Shinto's secretary, <PERSON> Kozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murata </PERSON>, made $ 179,000 profit and that $ 73,000 had been traced to the Nippon chairman's personal account. Shinto has denied reports of his personal involvement. Japanese news media, especially television, have delighted in showing political and business leaders changing their statements on the Recruit scandal. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, a contender for prime minister a year ago, gave at least three differing versions of how a trusted aide had used the finance minister's name to hold <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares. Two other Nippon figures also have acknowledged owning Recruit-Cosmos shares. One was <PERSON> Ei </PERSON> <PERSON> Shikiba </PERSON>, former head of the utility's integrated network service, who has been demoted. The other was <PERSON> Hisako </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>, former head of a <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> division who now is a Recruit executive. Recruit's links with the telephone utility included buying two U.S.-made supercomputers from <LOCATION> Nippon </LOCATION> and leasing data communications circuits. Meanwhile, two business executives said they were resigning from prestigious advisory posts in the wake of press reports linking them to Recruit-Cosmos shares. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Morio </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Chichibu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Jiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ushio </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Ushio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, an electronics firm, said they would leave senior positions with an advisory council called the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> The Recruit scandal has tarnished numerous careers since it surfaced last summer. Three news media executives lost posts, a Socialist resigned his seat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and a former vice minister of education, <PERSON> Kunio </PERSON> <PERSON> Takaishi </PERSON>, decided Tuesday not to run in the next parliamentary election after their names were mentioned in connection with the investigation. The scandal, however, has n't hurt Recruit-Cosmos' business. On Monday, it announced its unconsolidated pretax profit for six months through October was 57 percent higher than a year earlier, at $ 74 million. The subsidiary's main business is selling condominiums.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell against many major currencies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this afternoon after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government announced that the trade deficit for October was only slightly better than many economists had expected. The dollar, which had been mixed in light trading ahead of the 1:30 p.m. release of the trade report, dipped after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced that the deficit narrowed to $ 10.35 billion in October, the smallest imbalance in three months, from a revised September deficit of $ 10.67 billion. Market expectations for the trade deficit had varied widely, from $ 12 billion to as low as $ 8.5 billion, but many economists had expected the deficit to roughly match September's. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.8250 after the report was released from $ 1.8195 at midmorning. But it was stll lower than $ 1.8280 Wednesday. Other dollar rates after the trade report, with midmorning rates in parentheses, as compared with late Wednesday's rates, were: 1.7413 -LRB- 1.7483 -RRB- West German marks, up from 1.7410; 1.4670 -LRB- 1.4700 -RRB- Swiss francs, down from 1.4705; 5.9525 -LRB- 5.9765 -RRB- <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> francs, down from 5.9775; 1.9675 -LRB- 1.9552 -RRB- Dutch guilders, down from 1.9715; 1,285.50 -LRB- 1,287.80 -RRB- Italian lire, down from 1,286.50; 1.2005 -LRB- 1.2020 -RRB- Canadian dollars, up from 1.1995. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.29 yen to a closing 123.35. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 122.75 yen after the report and 123.35 yen before. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price for gold of $ 419.60 a troy ounce at midmorning Wednesday, unchanged from the opening bid but slightly lower than $ 420.75 bid late Tuesday.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit declined to $ 10.35 billion in October, the smallest imbalance in three months, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the merchandise trade gap between what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imports and what it sells overseas fell by 3.1 percent from a September deficit of $ 10.67 billion. The decline, the second consecutive improvement, was slightly better than many economists had been predicting. The dollar and bond prices were lower following today's announcement The October improvement came from a 1.7 percent drop in imports, which declined to $ 38.02 billion, on a seasonally adjusted basis. This decline offset a smaller 1.1 percent drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, which edged down to $ 11.75 billion. In another report today, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the use of industrial capacity rose 0.2 percentage points to 84.2 percent last month, the highest level since 84.3 percent in November 1979. It was the seventh increase in eight months. An accompanying <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> report said industrial production climbed a brisk 0.5 percent in November following an identical 0.5 percent rise in October. On Tuesday, the government reported that November retail sales jumped 1.1 percent, giving rise to more worries about inflation while giving store owners more confidence about the outlook for the holiday shopping season. `` It looks like the Christmas season will be better than people feared and make an important contribution to growth,'' <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> said Tuesday in releasing the report. Christmas sales provide general merchandisers with about half of their annual profits. Retail sales are considered a key indicator of economic growth because consumer activity accounts for about two-thirds of gross national product. In other economic developments Tuesday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the deficit in the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade shrank to $ 30.89 billion from July through September, the smallest imbalance in three years _ The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a business-financed research group, indicated consumers became more cautious about their economic futures in November following the presidential election and the renewed debate over the budget deficit _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> said its members expect the economy to do better in 1989 than it has done this year, with continued growth and slower inflation Bond prices fell on Tuesday in reaction to the concerns about inflation raised by the retail sales report. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond, which rises when the price falls, edged up to 8.97 percent from 8.95 percent late Monday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which lost 3.91 points on Monday, closed up 3.91 on Tuesday at 2,143.49. Broader indicators of the market narrowly declined.

<HEAD>Report Says Drexel Facing Pressure to Accept Plea Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors are pressuring <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to accept a plea-bargain settlement that would include paying a $ 750 million fine and admitting guilt to at least five felony counts to avoid prosecution for racketeering and securities fraud, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Quoting sources it did not identify, the newspaper said both sides were close to an agreement late Tuesday that would end one of the most intensive criminal securities fraud investigations in history. A $ 750 million fine for securities fraud would dwarf the record $ 100 million in penalties paid two years ago by <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the now-imprisoned stock speculator who turned state's evidence and has been a key source of evidence against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. The nation's fifth-largest securities firm has maintained innocence throughout an investigation that has been colored by press leaks and speculation. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> executives have said they are interested in a settlement to avoid prosecution and a lengthy trial, but admitting guilt would mark a stunning turnaround and open the firm to numerous civil lawsuits by investors who allege they were defrauded. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, declined to comment on the Journal story. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, who have been coordinating the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> investigation, also declined comment. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is privately owned and is one of the most profitable Wall Street firms, specializing in the market for high-yield, high-risk debt securities commonly called `` junk bonds.'' It has played a major role in some of the biggest corporate takeovers of all time, including the record $ 24.53 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced Nov. 30. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is known to have set aside hundreds of millions of dollars for a potential settlement with the government. The firm is eager to avoid a racketeering indictment, which could seriously impair its business and involve enormous fines if a jury found <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> guilty. Three months ago <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filed a massive civil lawsuit that accused <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, its high-yield bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and three other key employees of conspiring with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to profit on inside information, manipulate stock, defraud <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> clients, keep phony books and other violations. A federal grand jury has been expected to indict <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> on criminal charges as well, but the indictments repeatedly have been delayed, evidently as a pressure tactic to convince the potential defendants to reach plea-bargain settlements instead. While <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has expressed interest in settling, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has not negotiated with government prosecutors and has vowed to vindicate himself at trial.

<HEAD>Operating Rate at Factories, Mine and Utilities Highest in Nine
Years</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds last 11 grafs, At manufacturing, with breakdown</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The operating rate at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities in November rose to the highest level in nine years, the government said today in a report likely to heighten concern about inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the use of industrial capacity rose 0.2 percentage points to 84.2 percent last month, the highest since 84.3 percent in November 1979. It was the seventh increase in eight months. As capacity use edges toward 85 percent, economists fear factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. In an accompanying report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said industrial production climbed a brisk 0.5 percent in November following an identical 0.5 percent rise in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s industrial production index now stands at 139.9 percent of its 1977 base, reflecting gains in light truck manufacturing and production of equipment for businesses. The jumps in capacity use and the production index were in line with economists' expectations. Most government statistics have portrayed a robust economy in October and November, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which has been bolstered by strong export sales caused by the lower value of the dollar, which makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more affordable on overseas markets. At manufacturing plants, the operating rate climbed to 84.5 percent last month, up from 84.3 percent in October. Producers of both durable goods _ `` big ticket'' items ranging from bicycles to battleships _ and non-durable goods reported higher rates. The rate at durable goods plants was 83.1 percent in November, up from 82.9 percent. Non-durable goods producers recorded a 0.1 percentage point gain to 86.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the operating rate for primary metals industries jumped to 92.4 percent, the highest since December 1978. Most of the increase was attributed to increases at steel mills. Use of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing capacity rose for the fourth consecutive month to 85.4 percent, reflecting gains in light truck production. Automobile plants, a subcategory, slipped to 76.7 percent, down from 77.0 percent. The operating rate at utilities was 81.0 percent in November, up from 80.8 percent. It had hit a peak for the year in August of 83.9 percent because of a surge in electricity use for air conditioning. In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the operating rate increased to 82.2 percent last month. It was 81.6 percent in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s production index has not declined since September 1987, a reflection of the export-driven manufacturing boom. A related surge in spending for capital equipment to expand and modernize factories has accompanied the boom. Production in the manufacturing sector rose 0.5 percent in November, following an even stronger 0.6 percent gain in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.6 million units, down slightly from October. But production of business equipment rose 0.4 percent following a flat month in October and stood 8.8 percent higher than a year ago. Output at mines, which includes oil and gas drilling, rose 0.6 percent in November after three consecutive declines. Production at utilities increased 0.4 percent, on top of a 0.6 percent jump in October. Total output at factories, mines and utilities was 5.1 percent higher than a year ago.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Nigeria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> has dismissed 3,000 workers, a third of the work force, in a bid to keep the bankrupt airline operating. Police surrounded the state airline's headquarters on Wednesday to prevent attacks. Earlier this year, the airline sharply reduced its overseas flights after accidents grounded some aircraft and two planes were seized for non-payment of debts. <ORGANIZATION> Nigeria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> has been denied overflight rights by some countries for refusing to pay its bills. The airline reportedly owes creditors more than $ 1 billion. International flight attendants were replaced with attendants from domestic flights this year after several attendants and flight crew members were arrested on drugs charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Some senior officials were among those dismissed Wednesday, including the director of engineering and maintenance. Retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Olu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajowa </PERSON>, who was appointed administrator to resolve the airline's financial problems, announced the dismissals. In addition to management problems, the airline suffered through years of over-valuation of the Nigerian naira and its fares, set by the government, which often were below cost. Some officials of the military government have predicted the airline would be privatized. Last month, <PERSON> Bajowa </PERSON> ordered the airline to change the symbol on its planes' tail sections from a flying elephant to an eagle.

<HEAD>Wheat Production Could Reach New Levels, Council Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 World wheat production could reach a record 550 million metric tons in the 1989-90 season, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. This would be 5 million tons more than expected consumption and would allow world stocks to rebuild, said the council, the commodity's leading forecasting body. A decline in stocks after the estimated fall of 37 million tons this season would leave an `` uncomfortably narrow margin of security between world supply and demand,'' the council said. Stocks built up during the wheat glut of the mid-1980s are being depleted this season because of the sharp drop in 1988-89 wheat production caused by droughts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. World wheat production for 1988-89 now is forecast by the council at 500 million tons, 13 million below the previous season's figure and 37 million down on the 1986-87 record. Tighter supplies this season have led to higher world prices which are encouraging growers to increase plantings for 1989-90, the council said. World production of coarse grains, principally corn, now is estimated at 718 million tons for 1988-89, compared with 712 million forecast in October and the 1987-88 output of 804 million, the council said. The council has raised by 2 million tons to 33 million tons its estimate of 1988-89 Soviet grain import needs. That's up from 32 million tons in 1987-88. Its estimates of Soviet wheat production remained unchanged at 200 million tons compared with 211 million in 1987-88.

<HEAD>Dock Strike Paralyzes Brazilian Ports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of striking dock workers demanding higher pay have closed the nation's main ports, officials said today. Portobras, the government agency that operates the ports, said about 30,000 workers walked off their jobs Tuesday in 12 of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 30 ports, including <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest port The strike continued today, but there were few details of how widespread it was. About $ 3 million has been lost in uncollected port fees, the Portobras press office said. In <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, 45 miles from <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, the strike was causing daily losses of about $ 1.1 million, officials said. About 52,000 tons of products a day, ranging from automobiles and iron ore to soybeans and chemical products, `` are being left unhandled aboard 25 ships that are docked in Santos,'' said <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, one of the directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Santos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that workers were demanding a 38 percent wage increase Neither he nor <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> would say what the average salary of a dock worker was. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said the dock company has not made any wage offers to the strikers `` because we barely have enough money to pay December's salaries.

 <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> used to buy $ 280 sweaters to stock her small <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> boutique <PERSON> Osidi </PERSON>, but her expectations about holiday sales this year are slightly less ambitious. `` I'd shake if I took that in,'' said the store owner, explaining how the long slump in apparel sales has colored her inventory decisions for the season. While she did order a handful of $ 400 outfits _ with customers shopping for New Year's Eve in mind _ the shop's fashion statement this Christmas is stylish yet inexpensive. `` I think there's a big economic problem in the city,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> during a reporter's visit to <LOCATION> Osidi </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gramercy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, south and to the east of midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. But she also predicted, `` The season is going to be OK _ I have no doubt about that.'' When you think of shopping in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, big stores like <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s or <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s come to mind, or on a smaller scale, the scores of trendy shops on Madison and <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> avenues <PERSON> Osidi </PERSON> is nothing like any of those retailers. It is a small neighborhood store that caters to women who live in what is a largely middle-class area. The bulk of Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON>'s business comes from regular customers _ many of whom she knows on a first-name basis and who do n't like the big stores. They periodically stop by just to see what's new and maybe chat and have a cup of coffee with the owner, an outgoing woman who obviously loves what she's doing. The store sells casual clothing and outfits that could be worn to work or to parties. Sweaters at <LOCATION> Osidi </LOCATION> go for $ 48 to $ 70, and two - and three-piece wool jersey outfits range from about $ 220 to the low $ 300s At this time of the year, there are a number of party dresses for about $ 200. <PERSON> Osidi </PERSON> does a lot of business in accessories: silver, antique and costume jewelry; scarves; lingerie; belts and pocketbooks. These `` low-ticket'' items have been the boutique's biggest sellers so far this season. Holiday sales at <LOCATION> Osidi </LOCATION> _ the store's name comes from the nickname of one of Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON>'s friends _ have been erratic this year. The Friday after Thanksgiving, in contrast to the mob scene uptown at <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s and other big stores, <PERSON> Osidi </PERSON> was quiet, but Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> was unperturbed. Although that day was the traditional start of the Christmas shopping season, it has never been a big day at her store. Business picked up over the following weekend, but sales have ebbed and flowed since then _ along with Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON>'s outlook. When volume picked up several days into December, she was pleased but realistic: `` It's nothing like it should be.'' Like most other stores across the country, <LOCATION> Osidi </LOCATION> has had to lower its expectations because of the nearly 2-year-old slump in retail spending. Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON>, who has been a clothing retailer or manufacturer for more than 20 years, said the 14 months since October 1987 have been the worst retail season she's seen. She remembers painfully well Oct. 19 of last year _ the day of the stock market crash. <PERSON> Osidi </PERSON> took in $ 30 in sales. Since then, her business has changed drastically. Some of <PERSON> Osidi </PERSON>'s customers _ who included stockbrokers _ lost their jobs Others became very wary _ `` they think twice,'' is the way Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> puts it. `` That customer's not there any longer,'' she said of the women who used to spend freely. These days, she says, it is her regular customers who `` thank God keep me in business.'' She knows she's not alone, that other retailers have had the same troubles over the past year. And she's heard via the merchant grapevine that their Christmas season is going slowly. `` My suppliers say everyone's crying,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> went into the last two weeks of the season complaining that no one seemed to be in the Christmas spirit, yet she still expected things to turn out all right, if not great. `` Normally, we're a late store,'' she said, explaining that the bulk of her Christmas business comes in the final week, from last-minute shoppers and people who could n't find what they wanted anywhere else or who could n't contend with the uptown crowds. On the very last day of the season, Christmas Eve, she expects to see mostly men buying a lot of jewelry. Will she be satisfied at the end, if and when those eleventh-hour shoppers come through? No. `` The numbers just are n't there,'' she said, and added, `` No matter what you do, people are n't going to spend money.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ With the make-it or break-it season in full swing for the nation's retailers, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> takes an inside look at how two stores are handling the holiday rush in side-by-side stories from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>.

 Back in February, just weeks after holiday decorations were taken down, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> department store executives began designing `` the look'' for Christmas 1988: seahorse planters surrounded by a red-and-gold decor. Now, 10 months later, there's anxious optimism that the perpetual planning for the holiday season has helped shoppers get into the spending mood and will translate into another color: green. `` We're way ahead of last year and I'm exceeding expectations for this year,'' says a beaming <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hougard </PERSON>, manager for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s two Lazarus stores in downtown Grand Rapids and the suburb of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. And for retailers, those are the magic words. In the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas, many retailers make about half their annual profit. And to make the most of the profit potential, department store chains such as Cincinnati-based <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> are thinking Christmas almost year-round. `` The planning begins in February _ the promotional calendar, the merchandise we expect to introduce, how the stores are going to look,'' says <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gafford </PERSON>, senior vice president of corporate affairs for <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, which operates 43 stores in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. When the stores get the planning diagrams, merchandise schedules and props from corporate headquarters, they make adjustments for their individuals stores and begin the physical transition about two months before Thanksgiving. `` I spend about a week on 12-foot ladders,'' says <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauchmar </PERSON>, visuals manager for both stores. Mauchmar figures she's trimmed nearly 100 trees, hung scores of 9-foot lengths of garland along with countless `` For Someone Special'' signs from the ceiling, positioned thousands of poinsettias and set up numerous special displays, many of which she guesses ultimately will be altered by rambunctious youngsters. She's worked many 11-hour days and six-day weeks to prepare It's also up to <LOCATION> Mauchmer </LOCATION> to make those stacks of heated ice scrapers for car windshields and golf ball monogrammers reach out and grab the shopper's attention. `` It's my job to make that gift look appealing, to make it look irresistible,'' she says with an exhausted laugh. Weather plays an important part, too. <PERSON> Hougard </PERSON> was happy with the warmer-than-normal temperatures and sunny skies on the day after Thanksgiving, traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year. But she was even happier when it snowed Dec. 12, less than two weeks before the holiday. `` People feel like shopping for Christmas presents when it looks like Christmas outside,'' she says. Mood is important not just for the customers, but for employees as well. At a recent meeting, the chain's top corporate executives and the 42 store managers dressed up in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> beards and hats for a group photograph. Though the hours are longer and the work more tiring, nearly every level of <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> employee says the brisk business is uplifting. `` Everyone's spirits are high. When it's busy like this, the days just fly by,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Alman </PERSON>, a sales manager in the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> store. The mood in both stores is in sharp contrast to the past 2 -LCB- years, when employees were uncertain about their futures and head-spinning takeovers became a topic of everyday conversation. The two stores used to be known as <PERSON> Herpolscheimer </PERSON>'s, a 117-year-old fixture that was part of <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. But in December 1986, Allied was acquired in a hostile takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The following month, the two Grand Rapids-area stores were incorporated into Block's, a sister Allied division that was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in April 1987. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, which owned the <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> chain, changed the Block's name to <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, and in November 1987, the Herpolscheimer's signs came down and the bronze-and-white <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> signs went up But the stores, which were changed from `` home'' stores with houseware departments to apparel-and-cosmetics only, were far from ready for the Christmas season. `` People did n't know who we were, stock levels were poor and we did n't have the right merchandise,'' <PERSON> Hougard </PERSON> said. `` It took some time for us to build up our reputation _ and get ` Lazarized.''' The changes were traumatic, but they were n't over. In May 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> bought <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and its department store chains, including <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>. This year, there is upgraded merchandise, plenty of stock _ and customers are responding. There are also plenty of incentives, including such giveaways as a free stuffed teddy bear that other department stores sell for up to $ 17.50 with a purchase. `` I see people walking in with gift lists and walking out with bags galore,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> VanKoevering </PERSON>, a sales supervisor in the downtown store. `` It's a challenge to keep the stock out.'' What are they buying? Such non-necessities as silk men's pajamas and boxer shorts at $ 24 a piece, Victorian-style lingerie, and adult-style fashions for children. `` Instead of things they need, like warm socks and coats, they're buying holiday sweaters with holly leaves,'' <PERSON> VanKoevering </PERSON> said `` I have n't seen that before and I think it's a good sign.''

 The stock market declined slightly today in an unenthusiastic response to the latest news on international trade. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.91 to 2,139.58 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Losers narrowly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 540 up, 586 down and 580 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 41.01 million shares at midmorning. Before the opening the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the nation's trade deficit in October came in at $ 10.35 billion, down from a revised $ 10.67 billion in September and a shade below advance estimates on Wall Street. But analysts said the difference between expectations and the actual number was n't great enough to stir up any significant interest in stocks. In addition, they said, traders seemed concerned over separate evidence of continued strength in the economy, which might help induce the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten credit further. Industrial production rose 0.5 percent in November, and the industry operating rate rose to 84.2 percent of capacity, a nine-year high. First <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 8 \ to 27 The company said late Tuesday that it will report a loss of $ 145 million to $ 190 million for the fourth quarter arising from some problem loans. <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> jumped 4 -LRB- to 29 -RRB-. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, the real estate developer and investor, asked for regulatory approval to buy 15 percent or more of the company's stock, and said he may seek to gain control of it.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers said they would spend more than $ 4.7 billion this year insuring the health of their employees. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> say rising health care costs and use of insurance plans have pushed up health-care spending in 1988. `` It's the system in general, costs are escalating on all sides,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. `` It's not just coming from the auto companies.'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> estimated that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> would pay out more than $ 1 billion for health care in 1988, up from the $ 920 million it paid in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Molloy </PERSON> declined to estimate how much the No. 1 automaker would spend in health care, but said there is a trend toward increasing costs. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 2.9 billion on health care last year. She said the price of the insurance and utilization of it led to the upward trend in costs. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Northard </PERSON> said comparing 1987 and 1988 costs was difficult because <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in August 1987.

<HEAD>Yeutter Predicts U.S. Will Prevail On Agriculture Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will prevail in its fight with <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> over agricultural subsidies because its position is `` on the side of the angels,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who is being considered for the post of Agriculture Secretary in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will retaliate against the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> if it implements a Jan. 1 ban on importing hormone-treated meat. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has already decided it will strike against some European imports, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, `` and that decision stands.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not found any evidence that hormone-treated animals endanger consumers' health, `` and therefore this is an illegal trade barrier.'' The ball is now in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s court `` and time is getting short,'' he said The 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> said last week it intends to implement the ban, which had already been put off for one year at the request of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The measure would affect some $ 170 million worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat. One possible compromise offered by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> would exempt meat which is used for pet food and which accounts for about 50 percent of the imports. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the Americans rejected that solution because they are determined to hold out for all or nothing as a matter of principle. Prospects for a compromise appeared to dim last week as relations between the two trading giants soured over an unrelated dispute about government support for farmers. The impasse blocked other progress at an international trade meeting of 100 nations in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and left residues of bitterness on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. To avert collapse of the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> meeting, which was a mid-term review of the four-year <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of trade negotiations, participants agreed to meet again in the first week of April in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` Let's hope reason will prevail'' in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. If the agriculture issue is not solved, he warned, `` there's obviously jeopardy to the entire <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round.'' The controversy stems from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand that all members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- abolish their farm supports which distort trade on the world market. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, under strong pressure from its large rural population, advocates reduction in subsidies but not elimination. `` We're on the side of the angels on this issue,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said, `` and everyone, including our <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies, knows this.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends that elimination of farm supports will lower government expenditure and ease the burden on consumers and taxpayers around the world. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> predicted political pressure on the Europeans would mount between now and April, `` and political pressure can generate political will'' to change positions. The pressure is expected to come from agricultural exporters such as <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, whose farmers are having trouble competing against the subsidized European and American farm exports.

 Grain and soybean futures opened narrowly mixed today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with little fresh news in the markets to influence prices. The quiet opening in the corn and wheat pits suggested traders were still holding to expectations for large-scale export sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, analysts said. Reports of a pickup in soybean meal exports last week lent some support to the soybean complex but buying interest was limited by a change to wetter weather in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean belt, where planting continues. `` We saw some reasonably good shower activity in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> yesterday and over the next few days it looks like scattered light showers,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` That's keeping the market from getting too strong here at the moment.'' In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.27 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 cent lower with December at $ 2.65 a bushel; oats were unchanged across the board with March at $ 2.20 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents higher with January at $ 7.65 -LCB- a bushel. Cattle futures were slightly higher while pork futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .20 cent to .35 cent higher with Decem The so-called Montgomery Amendment was passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after governors in some states began objecting _ and blocking _ deployment of their <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> units on training assignments to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Trump Indicates He May Seek Control Of Caesars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has notified the federal government that he wants to buy 15 percent or more of <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock and that he may seek controlling interest, the hotel and casino company says. In a statement issued late Tuesday, Caesars officials said they were notified that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has asked the government for a ruling on whether his investment in Caesars would violate federal antitrust laws. The disclosure sent <PERSON> Caesars </PERSON>' common stock sharply higher today. In midday trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Caesars </PERSON> was up $ 4 a share to $ 29.25. But gaming analysts said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who already owns two casinos in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and is building a third, would face regulatory obstacles to a move on <LOCATION> Caesars </LOCATION> in both <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, where Caesars is based, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which prohibits single ownership of no more than three casinos. The Los Angeles-based <PERSON> Caesars </PERSON> owns the highly profitable Caesars Hotel Casino here and the <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Caesars </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> casino hotels in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Neither <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s filing nor Caesars' statement indicated how much <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> stock <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> may already own. Tuesday's filing was made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once they have acquired $ 15 million worth of stock in a company. At Tuesday's closing price of $ 25.25 per share, that would translate to about 590,000 shares, or about 2.4 percent of <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'s 24.5 million common shares outstanding <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbron </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Turmp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> had no comment on the filing other than to confirm that it was made. She declined to say how much Caesars' stock, if any, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> already owns According to the Caesars' statement, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> indicated he `` has the good faith intention, subject to price, availability and necessary approvals, if any,'' to acquire 15 percent of <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'s stock. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s filing also said he `` may decide to seek control of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- through the acquisition of 50 percent -LRB- or -RRB- more of the outstanding voting securities.'' `` Due to the confusing content of this notice, -LRB- Caesars -RRB- is unable to ascertain Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s plans at this time and has no further comment,'' the company said in its release. One gaming analyst, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said he doubts that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is serious about making a move to acquire <PERSON> Caesars </PERSON>, and said any such move would face serious regulatory opposition in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. `` The gaming board in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> has come out and said it does not particularly relish hostile takeovers, and I can tell you that this would be a hostile takeover because the company will vigorously defend its independence,'' he said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> gaming regulators have also strongly opposed hostile takeovers of casino companies. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> now owns Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casino hotels in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and is building the massive Taj Mahal casino hotel, which should be complete in 15 months.

<HEAD>Australian Company to Buy Second Texas Specialty Retailer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In its second rescue of a troubled <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> retailer, an Australian property and retail company has signed a letter of intent to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Frost </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> chain for an undisclosed sum. <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> bought 80 percent of the Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Sakowitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in November 1987, bringing it out of bankruptcy <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON>, the chain's chairman and a member of its founding family, held the remaining 20 percent. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> announced that L.J. <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, its wholly owned subsidiary, would fold the San Antonio-based <ORGANIZATION> Frost </ORGANIZATION> chain into <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON>, operate all the stores under the <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON> name and put <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON> in charge of the combined operation. Both chains are high-priced merchandisers catering to wealthy customers and emphasizing upscale women's apparel. Both also operate four stores. All the <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON> outlets are in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, while Frost's are in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> In a prepared statement, Hooker Executive Chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herscu </PERSON> said, `` The proposed expansion of <ORGANIZATION> Sakowitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is a rare opportunity to bring together two of the finest names in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> specialty retailing targeted to the upscale and quality-conscious customer.'' Frost Bros. filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in April. The financially troubled retailer had gone public in an effort to improve its financial picture, but that plan fell through with the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyly </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Torie </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyly </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, had bought the chain from <ORGANIZATION> Manhatten </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for an estimated $ 50 million in August 1986, and <PERSON> Wyly </PERSON> said at the time he would concentrate on the `` Mercedes Benz niche'' in retailing. Between the purchase date and the bankruptcy filing, the number of stores was cut from 13 to nine. More stores were closed after filing, including two in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> _ at the <LOCATION> Galleria </LOCATION> and Memorial City shopping centers. Frost continues to operate its third <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> store near the exclusive <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION> neighborhood. The company had 1985 revenue of $ 120 million. More recent figures were not available. <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, is an aggressive buyer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailers and a real estate developer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. It bought 80 percent of <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON> in 1987 for $ 7.5 million under an amended plan of reorganization filed in federal bankruptcy court. <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON> was the nation's last remaining high-fashion speciality retailer controlled by a founding family member. It filed for Chapter 11 reorganization protection in the wake of financial troubles stemming partly from the economic slump in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. At the time of the filing in 1985, <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON> had 17 stores and six boutiques in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, a number of which since have been sold. Other <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> holdings include <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the New York-based department store chain which it acquired in October 1987 for an undisclosed price, and <ORGANIZATION> Parisian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, specialty retailer which it acquired along with <ORGANIZATION> Parisian </ORGANIZATION>'s major shareholders in September 1987 in a $ 252 million buyout. <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> also is developing four regional shopping malls in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, averaging 1.5 million square feet each.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed to $ 10.35 billion in October, the smallest imbalance in three months, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the merchandise trade gap between what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imports and what it sells overseas fell by 3.1 percent from a September deficit of $ 10.67 billion. The decline represented the second consecutive monthly improvement. But many analysts were unimpressed, saying after monthly fluctuations, the deficit has been essentially flat for several months. `` I think the improvement in the trade deficit has stalled out,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We still have a very heavy flow of imported goods, especially on the manufacturing side.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was more optimistic. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> cited the progress made so far, noting that exports have climbed by 28 percent over the past 10 months. `` While the trend continues to be favorable, our trade deficit is still very large. Eliminating it, which is our goal, poses a major challenge,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Financial markets, which in the past have reacted violently to disappointing trade figures, for the most part shrugged off today's report The Dow Jones industrial average had fallen by about 5 points shortly before midday. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said that the operating rate at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percentage point last month to 84.2 percent, its highest level in nine years. That report, which was in line with economists' predictions, is likely to intensify cononcern about inflation. As capacity use edges toward 85 percent, economists fear factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. The October trade improvement came from a 1.7 percent drop in imports, which declined to $ 38.02 billion, on a seasonally adjusted basis. This decline offset a smaller 1.1 percent drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, which edged down to $ 27.67 billion. Even with the small setback in exports, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> overseas sales remained near record high levels. For the first 10 months of this year, export sales are running 28.3 percent above the same period in 1987. This remarkable surge in export sales has been responsible for almost half of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s overall economic growth this year as American manufacturers have hired workers and stepped up output to meet demand. Through October, the overall merchendise trade deficit has been running at an annual rate of $ 136.1 billion, 20 percent below the all-time high imbalance of $ 170.3 billion recorded last year. President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited this improvement during the presidential campaign as proof that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policies of solving the country's trade woes were working The administration launched an effort in September 1985 to drive the value of the dollar lower to make <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods more competitive on overseas markets while driving up the price of imports. The effort took far longer to bear fruit than many had expected and has to this day failed to halt the steady increase in imports, which are running 8.3 percent higher so far this year over 1987. The $ 10.35 billion October deficit was the lowest since a $ 9.47 billion July imbalance. That had been the smallest deficit since December 1984. The trade report, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said, was `` good news on which to close out 1988. He added that the deficit was now falling `` at a satisfactory pace.'' Today's good news on trade followed a report Tuesday showing that the deficit in the broadest measure of trade, the current account, fell to $ 30.89 billion in the July-September quarter, the lowest level in three years. The current account method adds the value of investments and services to the value of goods reflected in today's report. Many economists are worried that despite the dramatic declines in the trade deficit this year, the improvement is in danger of stalling next year, a development that could push the country into a recession. Some economists contend that the dollar must fall further to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods even more competitive and dampen Americans' appetite for imports. Other analysts are urging the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrative to waste no time in launching an aggressive effort to open more foreign markets to American products. The October report is likely to provide ammunition to these critics because of a 34.1 percent jump in the trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The trade imbalance with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the largest with any country, surged to $ 5.5 billion in October, the highest it has been in a year. The deficit with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> was unchanged at $ 1.4 billion while the deficit with <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> rose to $ 1.1 billion, $ 200 million higher than in October. The deficits with individual countries are not adjusted to take into account normal monthly variations in trade flows. Before the seasonal adjustment, the overall deficit would have been $ 11.75 billion, reflecting the fact that October is a big import month as retailers stock up for the Christmas season.

 Dow Jones & amp; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday it expects its profit for 1988 will be up 11 percent to 14 percent from last year due principally to non-recurring gains But <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> chairman and chief executive officer, said that if nonrecurring items were excluded, the company's earnings would be down 6 percent to 10 percent from a year earlier. He said the decline reflected year-long softness in financial advertising linage and revenue at its business publications in the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash. In remarks prepared for delivery to securities analysts, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said he expected the company would earn between $ 226 million, or $ 2.33 a share, and $ 232 million, or $ 2.39 a share, this year. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 203 million, or $ 2.10 a share, on revenue of $ 1.31 billion.

<HEAD>Soybeans Surge On Strength In Meal Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures closed sharply higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, in line with a strong late rally in soybean meal linked to speculation about increased export sales, analysts said. Corn prices also closed higher while wheat futures finished narrowly mixed. Soybean meal traders noted recent purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meal by <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, `` and there were rumors of Soviet interest as well, and that seemed to be the driving force,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The strength in meal allowed the beans to rally and was successful in bringing up -LRB- soybean -RRB- oil as well,'' he said. Meal for delivery in January closed $ 5.10 higher at $ 250.20 per metric ton; soybeans gained as much as 14 -RCB- cents a bushel. Corn also was supported by rumors of Soviet buying interest but wheat trading was light amid a lack of fresh news affecting that market. At the close, wheat was 1 cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.26 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 4 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.66 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 2 cents higher with December at $ 2.11 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents to 14 -RCB- cents higher with January at $ 7.79 a bushel.

<HEAD>BP in Talks To Sell Minerals Operations to RTZ</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it is negotiating to sell its minerals operations to <ORGANIZATION> RTZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, a deal that analysts said could generate $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion for <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> said the talks were exclusively with <ORGANIZATION> RTZ </ORGANIZATION>, a British mining company with interests worldwide, and exclude any minerals businesses of BP <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Rumors of the talks have circulated for the last week and have helped drive <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>'s shares up and <ORGANIZATION> RTZ </ORGANIZATION>'s down. British Petroleum did not elaborate on the statement except to say that a further announcement will be made in due course. Its minerals interests include activities in gold, silver, copper and uranium mines in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. British Petroleum has considered selling off its gold operations for some time. In September, it postponed indefinitely the pricing date for an initial public offering of about 15 percent of the gold subsidiary. As speculation about the talks mounted last week, some analysts said <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> would use the proceeds of the sale to buy into existing businesses, possibly even including a bid for <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Other analysts noted that it could use the cash earned either to reduce debt or buy back shares held by the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. The Kuwaiti government body currently owns 21.68 percent of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> and has been told by the British government to reduce its holding to 9.9 percent, within a provisional timetable of a year. The money could give British Petroleum flexibility in bargaining with <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> over a sale price for some of the 700 million shares, which at current market prices have a total value of about 1.8 billion pounds _ equaling about $ 3.3 billion at current exchange rates. British Petroleum shares closed Wednesday at the equivalent of $ 4.74 a share, up 11 cents. <ORGANIZATION> RTZ </ORGANIZATION>'s shares fell 11 cents to finish at $ 7.01 a share. Analysts said it could take weeks to complete negotiations over the sale of the minerals businesses.

 The board of <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved a joint venture with <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Enichem </ORGANIZATION> to create a chemical company that is among the 10 largest in the world, with annual sales equaling about $ 10 billion. The approval was the final hurdle for creating the new company, <ORGANIZATION> Enimont </ORGANIZATION>, which is scheduled to begin operations Jan. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> told a news conference that <ORGANIZATION> Enimont </ORGANIZATION> will have an initial six-month transitory regime that could be phased out earlier if <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approves a legislation designed to give <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> a major tax break. <ORGANIZATION> Enichem </ORGANIZATION>, the chemical unit of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s energy group <ORGANIZATION> Ente </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nazionale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Idrocarburi </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- ENI -RRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> each will own 40 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Enimont </ORGANIZATION>.

The food and restaurant company posted a profit of $ 79.6 million, or 97 cents a share. Earnings per share totaled 90 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter because the average number of outstanding shares was higher, the company said.

<TEXT>
 First <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION>.'s stock plummeted Wednesday following the resignation of two top executives and an announcement that the big bank holding company expected a huge loss in the fourth quarter. The company announced the departure of <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pote </PERSON>, its highly regarded president and chief executive officer, and <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a vice chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, late Tuesday. It also said it had fired <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Galy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president and head of its <ORGANIZATION> international </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, will assume <PERSON> Pote </PERSON>'s duties. At the same time Tuesday, the company said it expected to lose between $ 145 million and $ 190 million in the fourth quarter due to problem loans. The company earned about $ 210 million, or $ 3.62 per share, for the first nine months of 1988. <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> sought to reassure investors and customers after the double-dose of negative news by issuing a statement promising, `` Our business and that of our constituent institutions is sound. `` We have one of the finest banking franchises in the country and within a short period of time our operating results will reflect that.'' But investors were wary nonetheless Wednesday. In closing trading Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>'s stock fell $ 8.50 per share to $ 27 in active trading. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Novek </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Beck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, said the resignations `` have created a void in upper-level management in the firm that people perceive as a real problem.'' `` There's no way to prevent all the activity,'' <PERSON> Novek </PERSON> said of Wednesday's trading. `` There are a lot of people who are looking at this as a very good buy right now and a lot who are washing their hands of the company.'' The projected fourth-quarter loss was attributed to certain commercial real estate loans and loans made to some international commercial customers, said <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. The losses in commercial and real estate projects were concentrated among a small number of borrowers at <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the company's <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> branch, with a large proportion of the problem loans made to a single borrower, the company said. In its Wednesday editions, The Wall Street Journal identified the borrower as <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Landmarks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Living </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a major renovator and syndicator of landmark buildings that is based in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Neither Historic Landmarks spokeswoman <PERSON> Deb </PERSON> <PERSON> Addis </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> would comment on the report Wednesday. The Journal said the loans in question predated the $ 1.3 billion merger completed in February 1988 of Newark-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Fidelcor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The merger created one of the 20 largest bank holding companies in the nation with assets of $ 30 billion.

<HEAD>Petroleum Imports Continued To Rise In November</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Petroleum imports rose sharply in November and domestic crude oil production took its biggest monthly dip this year, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. Imports jumped 14.1 percent to an average 7.95 million barrels a day from 6.97 million barrels in November 1987, with imports of gasoline and other refined products reaching their highest level since 1974, according to <ORGANIZATION> API </ORGANIZATION>'s Monthly Statistical Report. Daily domestic crude oil production fell 4.3 percent _ the biggest decline this year _ to an average of 8.04 million barrels a day, due mainly to a slowdown in output in the lower 48 states. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> production remained steady at around 2 million barrels a day, the report said. Analysts said strong demand in November continued to consume the growing imports as total supplies of crude oil and refined products declined 3.6 percent compared with the same time last year. The institute said lower world crude prices helped boost imports for the first 11 months of 1988 to their highest level since 1980 as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries continued its runaway production. However, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members agreed last month to lower cartel production in the first six months of 1989. World crude prices have firmed slightly since the accord in anticipation of a cutback. In November, crude oil imports averaged 5.3 million barrels a day, up 7.8 percent from November 1987, the report said. Product imports rose 29 percent to an average 2.7 million barrels a day. Daily gasoline imports reached a new high of 630,000 barrels for the month, up 80,000 barrels a day from a year ago. Distillate and residual fuel oil imports also were strong. In the past three years, daily imports are up by 2.2 million barrels, with increasing demand accounting for about two-thirds of the increase and declining domestic production accounting for most of the remainder, the <ORGANIZATION> API </ORGANIZATION> said. But despite high imports, total inventories fell by 5 million barrels in November. API said inventories have fallen about 18 million barrels since July, or more than 50 million barrels after accounting for seasonal factors. Combined deliveries surged more than 1.3 million barrels a day, an 8.1 percent increase from the year-ago period. Gasoline deliveries rose 3.6 percent, or nearly 5 million barrels, even as motorists began cutting back on travel. Gasoline production rose 1.5 percent while gasoline stocks declined 6 million barrels from last November. Distillate deliveries rose 7.3 percent despite continued mild weather. Analysts said the rise probably reflected investors taking advantage of weak prices. The report also said utilization of the nation's refineries increased to 83.2 percent from 82.3 percent last November.

 The dollar retreated Wednesday, hurt by what money dealers called rumors of a hike in West German interest rates and a negative market reaction to the monthly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report. Gold prices rose slightly in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading after easing marginally abroad. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 421 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $ 419.50 at the same time Tuesday. Foreign-exchange strategists said speculation that the West German central bank would tighten domestic credit conditions on Thursday raised demand for the West German mark and consequently increased the supply of dollars in the market, pushing down the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's value. Pressure on the dollar intensified after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $ 10.35 billion in October from $ 10.67 billion the month before. Although the shortfall was the smallest in three months, the market had anticipated an imbalance of about $ 10.5 billion. `` The figures came out in line with expectations, and since there's overriding bearish sentiment to the dollar, people just resumed selling it,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Yannalfo </PERSON>, a trader at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> commodities futures firm <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The only thing that could have prevented it would have been a really good number, like $ 7 or $ 8 billion.'' The monthly trade figures vary widely but have enormous potential to affect the dollar's value because they are considered one of the most visible indicators of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness and economic strength. A widening deficit suggests exports are weakening and the dollar will fall, while a narrowing shortfall suggests exports are strengthening and the dollar will rise. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where markets closed before the trade report was released, the dollar rose 0.29 Japanese yen to 123.35 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar dropped to 122.60 yen. By the time trading ended in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fetched 122.67 yen, down from 123.29 yen late Tuesday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> still is shopping for financial industry acquisitions and hopes to land one before tax breaks expire at year's end, Vice Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said any acquisition, likely to be one or more savings and loan institutions, could make <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s wholly-owned subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> the nation's biggest savings bank. First Nationwide now is the sixth-largest. First Nationwide in September failed in its bid to acquire <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the nation's biggest insolvent thrift. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> instead provided $ 2 billion in federal assistance to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> <PERSON> Group </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to acquire American in the largest government thrift rescue yet. `` We intend to continue to pursue diversification in the financial services area,'' <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said during an end-of-the-year review with reporters. `` Our specific goal is to do a good job. Becoming the largest is n't the objective. It's growth.'' <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> also said it appears that 1988 will be the auto industry's second-best sales year ever, with car and light truck sales at 15.6 million to 15.7 million The industry record of 16.3 million in sales was set in 1986. He said the 15.4 million estimate for the 1989 calendar year would be `` down from this year, but still a good industry.'' `` I'd be worried when our -LRB- market -RRB- share begins to run into problems,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market share for cars is 21.7 percent, he said. During the meeting, <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> also said: _ Buyer incentives would continue during the coming year, but `` I do n't see us leading the charge. He said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> would remain competitive when other automakers offer incentives. _ Discussions are under way for assembly of a car, probably modeled on <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s West German-made Scorpio, in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> The car probably would be made in an existing or new plant in the Gorky area. <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s North American earnings likely will be down from last year, resulting in smaller profit-sharing payments to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employees early in 1989. Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced profit-sharing payments of about $ 200 for each hourly and salaried worker, the first time since 1985 that the nation's No. 1 automaker has made such payments. `` I think it -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s profit-sharing payment -RRB- will be more than $ 200,'' <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said, smiling. <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said a proposal for a 15-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase should be considered by the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration only if other deficit reduction measures, especially federal spending cuts, prove unsuccessful. He said a 5-cent-a-year phase-in of such a tax increase would soften the blow on the auto industry, and provisions such as tax credits could be made for low-income taxpayers.

<HEAD>Sales Slump In Early December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks fell 11 percent in early December compared with a burst of incentive-driven sales in the same period a year ago, figures released Wednesday showed. The companies said they sold an average of 29,610 vehicles during each of the nine selling days in the Dec. 1-10 period this year, compared with an average of 33,251 during the same period last year, when there also were nine selling days. Car sales fell 10.5 percent and light truck sales dropped 11.7 percent in early December. Analysts said the declines were n't worrisome because of the revival of incentives during the period last year. `` They started putting on some heavy-duty incentives'' in early December last year, said analyst <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` You've got a tough time to compare it with. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudol </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Fitch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> agreed. `` That's hard to read,'' she said. `` It's not surprising that they're down a little bit, given that December is bad for auto sales anyway. `` In any -LRB- recent -RRB- 10-day period, you've had so much noise in the period that it's hard to make a comparison,'' <PERSON> Sudol </PERSON> added. `` That noise is incentives.'' Both agreed that despite the early December slip, the industry is healthy. As the calendar year draws to a close, the companies are looking forward to what could be the second-best sales year in history, behind the 16.3 million vehicles sold in 1986. For the year, sales by companies making cars and light trucks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have risen 6.9 percent in 1988 over 1987, going to a daily rate of 37,949 this year compared with a daily rate of 35,499 last year. Among the Big Three, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> showed the largest early-December decline in car sales, falling 12.9 percent to a daily rate of 8,906 cars in 1988 from 10,226 last year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were up 0.9 percent in 1988 over 1987 to a daily rate of 11,776 this year from 11,668 last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s sales in early December fell 11.6 percent to a daily rate of 5,582 this year compared with 6,316 in the same period last year. But for the year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales have climbed 7.7 percent to an average daily rate of 7,121 in 1988 compared with 6,612 in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said it sold cars at a daily rate of 2,673 in early December this year compared with 2,979 during the same period last year, a 10.3 percent decline. So far this year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has sold 10.3 percent more cars, with a daily sales rate of 3,451 in 1988 compared with 3,130 last year.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Hit 4{-Month Highs On Supply Fears</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Coffee futures prices rocketed to 4 -LCB- - month highs Wednesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as a dockworkers strike in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> ignited speculation about shriveling supplies On other markets, prices of copper, precious metals, energy and most agricultural futures also rose while stock-index futures retreated. Coffee's day-long rally was `` an explosion'' featuring extremely heavy volume, said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, a coffee broker with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Coffee settled 2.30 cents to 4.64 cents higher with the spot December contract at $ 1.35 a pound and the heavily traded March contract at $ 1.3342 a pound, the highest settlement price for either contract since July 25. Analysts said the Brazilian dockworkers' strike, which began Tuesday and halted shipments from the key coffee port of <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, was not expected to last long. But the strike focused the market's attention on dwindling warehouse stocks of coffee just as consumption approaches its annual peak, and on the steadily deteriorating crop-production outlook in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> due to a drought in that country's major coffee-growing regions. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> said supplies that ordinarily arrive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at this time of year have been delayed by heavy rains. And another 1 million bags of coffee recently authorized for release onto the market by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s price-support formula has not yet occurred, he said Since June, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s coffee-growing regions have received normal monthly precipitation in only one month _ October, said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Badenhop </PERSON>, an analyst wiht <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. For the year to date, precipitation in most of those areas is less than 50 percent of normal, he said The dry weather has lessened the quality of the 1988-89 Brazilian crop now being harvested and reduced projections for the 1989-90 crop from original estimates of more than 40 million bags to about 25 million bags. Copper futures rallied strongly on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in technically inspired buying following two days of steep declines, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, commodities trading adviser with <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Copper settled 2.20 cents to 4.20 cents higher with March at $ 1.332 a pound. Platinum soared in a technical rebound from its recent lows while gold and silver finished modestly higher, mainly in reaction to platinum's gains and to strength in the energy market, <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON> said. Platinum settled $ 9.50 to $ 14.50 higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with January at $ 604.50 a troy ounce. On the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold was $ 1.60 to $ 1.80 higher with February at $ 425.70 a troy ounce; silver was 0.9 cent to 1.4 cents higher with March at $ 6.305 a troy ounce. Energy futures prices surged on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s announcement that it would not increase production of crude oil, informally supporting <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s new production quotas designed to lift oil prices, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 34 cents to 39 cents higher with January at $ 16.37 a barrel; heating oil was 1.11 cents to 1.86 cents higher with January at 51.13 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .34 cent to .88 cent higher with January at 43.72 cents a gallon. Soybean futures settled sharply higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in sympathy with a strong late rally in soybean meal linked to talk of increased export sales, analysts said. Corn prices also closed higher while wheat futures finished narrowly mixed. Wheat settled -LCB- cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 4.26 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 4 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.66 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 2 cents higher with December at $ 2.11 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 7 -LCB- cents to 14 -RCB- cents higher with January at $ 7.78 \ a bushel On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, live cattle settled .15 cent to .65 cent higher with December at 72.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .57 cent higher with January at 84.30 cents a pound; live hog futures were .03 cent to .68 cent higher with December at 43.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent lower to .42 cent higher with February at 44.92 cents a pound. Stock-index futures retreated moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.20 points lower at 278.40.

 Steel imports rose 7.1 percent to 17.6 million tons for the first 10 months of 1988, but strong domestic demand held foreigners' share of the market near the goal of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> quota program, according to figures released Wednesday. Over 10 months of 1988, imports accounted for 20.4 percent of the market, practically the goal set by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration when it introduced import quotas in 1984. Imports in October declined to 1.5 million tons from 1.64 million tons in September and 1.61 million tons in October 1987. The figures, based on <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> data, were released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The rival <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imported </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> said that after deducting 2.5 million tons of steel imports bought by domestic mills for further processing, 10-month imports totaled 15 million tons, or 17.5 percent of the market. The percentage figure is well below the 18.5 percent target set for finished steel products. `` With -LRB- quotas -RRB- expiring in nine months and much being heard for and against renewal, overriding factors in any decision in addition to interest of domestic steel producers must also be those of domestic steel users, fabricators and manufacturers of steel-intensive products whose very existence creates the market for both domestic steel producers and importers,'' said <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, president of the importers institute and vice chairman of the importing firm <ORGANIZATION> Steelinter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is asking its creditors to reduce its annual foreign debt payments to the equivalent of 3 percent of its gross national product from the present 5 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> told federal senators and deputies on Tuesday that the new administration of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> had outlined the proposal to creditor banks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> did not disclose details of the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> proposal, but the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> financial daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiero </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday said the proposal would nearly halve <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s anticipated $ 16 billion debt service bill in 1989. The <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> newspaper El Universal on Wednesday reported the proposal won a sympathetic response from European bankers but `` has encountered obstacles and resistance in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of the change of government'' there. The newspaper said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankers have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> proposal, at least until President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is inaugurated on Jan. 20. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who was sworn in Dec. 1, repeatedly has warned that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> can not continue to devote 5 percent of its gross national product each year to service its $ 102 billion foreign debt, the developing world's second-highest after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will pay an estimated $ 14 billion in interest and principal on the debt in 1988. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Financiero </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> told a meeting of labor leaders on Monday that <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' negotiating team wants a debt restructuring agreement that would target a greater proportion of Mexican payments toward debt principal. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> also wants creditor banks to acknowledge the real value of Mexican debt paper as determined by the secondary market and to reschedule <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s servicing payments accordingly, the newspaper said. The secondary market has valued <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt at 50 cents on the dollar. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> newspapers on Wednesday reported that <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> plans to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the next few days to take up the proposal with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s creditors. Creditor banks have balked this year on moves toward Mexican debt-reduction proposals. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> did reduce its debt principal by $ 1.1 billion through a U.S.-backed bond auction earlier this year, but the reduction was far less than officials originally hoped for. <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON>'s disclosure of the new reduction target came after <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> named former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Petricioli </PERSON> as the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, yet another sign of the president's eagerness to achieve rapid progress in restructuring negotiations

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> airlines, said Wednesday it was withholding payment of preferred stock dividends because its subsidiaries were not meeting earnings objectives. The dividends, which <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said would amount to about $ 5.2 million, affect 6.5 percent depository preferred stock, 12 percent depository preferred stock, 6 -RCB- percent cumulative convertible junior preferred stock and 15 percent $ 20 cumulative preferred stock. Depending on the stock, dividends would have been payable between Dec. 31, 1988 and Jan. 31, 1989. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said its cash levels have been substantial throughout the year and now exceed $ 700 million, but provisions of the company's unsecured debt indentures incorporate overall earnings objectives that have not been met. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> singled out <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which it said `` continues to experience serious operating losses. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said the dividends would be paid later when profits offset the cumulative effects of recent losses. The proposed sale of assets such as the Eastern Shuttle also could aid in the resumption of the dividend, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is proposing that the shuttle, one of the airline's few profitable divisions, be sold to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million. The deal is being fought by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions, which have been at odds with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. Eastern has lost $ 1 billion in the last decade, including a $ 113 million loss in the third quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 494 million in the first nine months of 1988, more than double the $ 200 million in losses amassed during the same period a year ago.

 <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, a failure last month in its bid for the <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympics </ORGANIZATION>, shocked baseball and the television industry Wednesday by winning network rights for $ 1 billion over four years. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which has prided itself as beig the `` baseball network'' since 1947, said it was outbid by a substantial margin and accused its rival of irresponsibility. The new contract is the largest ever awarded one network for sports. It gives CBS the World Series in 1990 along with both league playoffs, the All-Star Game and a 12-game package during the season. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Musburger </PERSON>, who hosts the network's coverage of major events, was beaming. `` Today was like having an early Christmas and a dream come true,'' said <PERSON> Musburger </PERSON>, who umpired in the <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in 1959. `` I've worked for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> for 20 years and it's the one sport we never covered. Never in my wildest dreams did I think we'd get it all.'' Baseball will award a contract for cable rights next month and expects to earn an additional $ 75 million to $ 100 million a year. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, which have shared baseball since 1975, will televise games next season for $ 240 million under the final year of the current six-year, $ 1.1 billion pact. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> did not release details of its bid and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION>, criticized CBS. `` We made every effort to keep it,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` Regretfully, someone bid far more than was responsible. Everybody evaluates things differently. That bid was beyond our reach. Let them explain that bid.'' On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 169.25, up $ 1.37 -LCB- from Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, dropped 87 -LCB- cents to $ 45. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION>, said losing the <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> rights had nothing to do with his network's desire to wrest baseball from <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> continued a public squabble that began after <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 243 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> rights. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> at the time said CBS overbid. But after <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> rights for $ 401 million, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> implied his earlier comments were intended to trick CBS into lowering its bid for the Summer Games. Asked if he thought <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s remarks were uncalled for, <PERSON> Pilson </PERSON> said Wednesday: `` Art <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> can run his business and I'll run mine. You can ask him what happened to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s bid on major league baseball. `` Looking at the numbers, I think we're better off spending a billion dollars over four years than half a billion over two weeks.'' Although Wednesday's agreement was approved unanimously in a conference call of the 26 club owners, many details have not been completed. Commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, who wants to increase the number of day World Series games, said that matter still had to be negotiated. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> officials said day games would be considered, but they also said they were counting on baseball to improve the network's last-place, prime-time schedule <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said that on Monday, he sent the three networks a form listing the different events they could bid for. The networks were offered the playoffs, World Series, All-Star Game and regular-season packages of 12 and 30 games. CBS and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bid for the 12-game package and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> bid for 30 games. The networks individually came to <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s office with their bids on Tuesday. <PERSON> Pilson </PERSON> said he was asked back to explain details and on Wednesday CBS learned it had won. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said he had narrowed the cable bidders to four: <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SportsChannel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> KCTV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliates board, said the baseball contract bolstered his confidence in <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, president and CEO of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It demonstrates that <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> is in this business to win and people ought to quit speculating about whether he will go after premier events,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Winner </PERSON>, director of media at the <ORGANIZATION> Campbell-Mithun-Esty </ORGANIZATION> advertising agency, was unsure <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> could make money on the deal. `` The important fact from their point of view is they have 12 months of quality sports programming,'' he said. `` They are therefore the only network that can talk in that fashion.'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> already has rights to broadcast the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> basketball tournament and the U.S. Open tennis tournament.

<HEAD>Trump May Try To Get Control Of Caesars World</HEAD>

 The price of <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock surged Wednesday after developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> surprised the gaming industry by asking the federal government for a ruling on whether he could buy a controlling interest in the hotel and casino company without violating antitrust laws. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> filed notice on Tuesday with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of his desire to possibly purchase more than 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> common stock. Although neither <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Caesars </PERSON> will say how much <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> already owns, the filing was made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once they have acquired at least $ 15 million worth of stock in a company. The filing was disclosed after the markets closed on Tuesday, but <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wolrld </ORGANIZATION> stock rose sharply in active trading on Wednesday. In consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 4.25 to $ 29.50 a share. At that price, its 24.5 million shares are worth about $ 723 million. Caesars World officials refused comment on <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s notice, which it disclosed in a statement late Tuesday. The Los Angeles-based company said in the statement that `` due to the confusing content of this notice, it is unable to ascertain <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s plans ...' Trump also declined comment. `` Such filings are very confidential and he's been advised not to comment,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbron </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. Caesars World owns three gaming halls: Caesars Hotel Casino in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Caesars </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Caesars </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. In the filing, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he `` has the good faith intention, subject to price, availability and necessary approvals, if any, to acquire such number of shares ... to hold in excess of 15 percent of the outstanding voting securities'' of <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>. But he went on in the filing to say `` it is possible'' that he may `` decide to seek control'' of Caesars by buying 50 percent or more of its stock. Gaming analysts spent a good part of Wednesday pondering <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s latest move <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Caesars </PERSON> is `` one of the best-managed companies in the industry, and we felt it was worth up to $ 40 a share.'' But <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> gaming regulators would probably block any highly-leveraged hostile effort to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s style is not cash, it's to borrow,'' <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said. Under <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> law, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> can own only three gaming halls. So far, he is licensed for two _ Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casino hotels. A third, the massive <PERSON> Taj </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahal </PERSON>, is under construction and expected to be completed in 1990. `` I think he'll sell one anyway in the future, because it does n't make sense to market three in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said `` But the bottom line with this Caesars notice is that <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is interested in making money, not owning another casino. He simply bought into an undervalued situation and will come out with a profit.'' This is not the first time that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has invested in a rival casino company. He made a $ 30 million profit in <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock and a $ 24 million profit on <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock. He also purchased a small amount of stock in the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nugget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a move that his competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nugget </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, called a `` publicity stunt.''

Front springs now in the vehicles did not account for the added weight of the diesel engine, the statement said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it plans to crack down on stations that sell leaded gasoline at far cheaper prices and allow motorists to put it in no-lead cars. Lead disables pollution control equipment, causing increases of up to 80 percent in emissions of pollutants, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says. The agency said it had written refiners and marketers warning that inspectors would pay close attention to stations where leaded gasoline is priced significantly below unleaded regular. There are no federal penalties against individual motorists who use the wrong fuel, but <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> may impose civil fines of up to $ 10,000 on stations that permit it. Some states, however, make it an offense for individuals too. `` There really is n't any excuse for pricing unleaded above leaded'' since leaded now costs more to make, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, head of the mobile sources division in <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s air pollution program. The agency has only 20 inspectors of its own, but hires an unspecified number through contractors. These inspectors for years have been checking station tanks and, in cooperation with local police deparments, making spot checks of cars on the road. Those checks consistently show that one car in five has used the wrong fuel or had its pollution control devices tampered with at some time. At present, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 6 percent of cars requiring no-lead are using leaded gasoline, down from more than 10 percent a few years ago. Lead compounds have been added to gasoline since the 1920s because they are the cheapest antiknock additive, by far. Until the 1970s, car engines also relied on the compounds for valve seat lubrication. Some heavy duty engines did until the mid-1980s. Concern over pollution as well as lead toxicity led <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 to order maximum permissible lead reduced by more than 90 percent, from 1.1 gram per gallon to 0.1 gram. This means higher refining costs to produce a given octane. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>'s Oilgram, a trade publication, on Monday reported wholesale prices for leaded up to 2 cents a gallon higher than regular unleaded except in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and farther west, where the two grades generally were the same. Energy Department figures show leaded gasoline sold retail at 4.7 cents per gallon cheaper than regular unleaded for the first nine months of 1988. Currently, leaded gasoline is 15 percent of the market compared with 21 percent a year ago. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Koach </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s threats to fine dealers $ 10,000 are assinine.'' <PERSON> Koach </PERSON> complained: `` It's difficult for dealers to control misfueling. We've had reports of dealers threatened with violence'' for trying to stop customers from buying leaded. Independent dealers, he said, are pressured to adhere to retail prices their suppliers decide on. `` Why is leaded gasoline still cheaper? It's the oil companies' policy,'' <PERSON> Koach </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stow </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>, a major national brand that has stopped all leaded sales except in alcohol blends in five midwestern states, said, `` Our dealers set their own prices.'' In <LOCATION> Ashland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a midwestern marketer with 2,000 outlets, said leaded gasoline had been priced at or above unleaded regular `` for several months now'' at stations his company serves. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the largest industry trade group, said in a statement that misfueling was declining and would continue to do so, and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> should `` ensure that both the service station operator and the individual motorist are prevented from -LRB- engaging in -RRB- this practice.''

<HEAD>Liggett Introduces New Low-Price Cigarette</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that it is introducing a new cigarette called Pyramid, which will be available to retailers at carton prices comparable to those of 1980. <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> executives say Pyramid represents a new low-price category that is a departure from the direction the tobacco industry has been taking. `` Cigarette prices have climbed fairly steadily since 1981, with the primary reason being the major excise tax increase by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The difference between the price of generic cigarettes and full-price cigarettes is narrowing, he said, and the company felt the time was right to establish a third tier of cigarettes. `` What we're going to offer smokers who are showing this clear preference for branded-price-value cigarettes is the ability to buy a quality product using their 1988 purchasing power at early 1980 prices _ that's what the Pyramid is all about,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. He said the savings to consumers could range from $ 2.50 to $ 5 per carton, depending on the state in which it is bought or the price of the brand that it is being compared against. The cigarette industry today is as competitive as it was in the early 1980s, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said, and <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, the smallest of the six major cigarette manufacturers, has to be innovative. `` When faced with growing marketing pressures we began looking for non-conventional ways to counter big-spending efforts by the majors,'' he said. `` We ca n't outspend them, so we try and out-innovate them with another new category.'' The company began shipping Pyramid cigarettes on Monday.

The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in Thursday's editions, attributed the loss largely to erratic business and the pressure to stimulate sales by cutting prices.
