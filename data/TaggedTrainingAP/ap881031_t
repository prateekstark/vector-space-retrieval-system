<TEXT>
 A school board member took $ 8,000 in bribes from two teachers seeking promotions to vice principal, a federal grand jury charged Monday. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, was indicted by the panel on two counts of bribe-taking and two counts of extortion by a public official. He faces 60 years in prison if convicted on all counts. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, the board's second vice president, allegedly took $ 5,000 from one teacher as early as spring 1987 and $ 3,000 from another teacher last August in exchange for improving their chances for promotion, the indictment said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> declined to identify the teachers or their schools or say if they were ever promoted. `` This is part of a continuing investigation into activities of this type,'' <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bross </PERSON>, a board attorney, said he believes the teachers were not promoted. <PERSON> George </PERSON> could not be reached Monday. His phone number is unlisted, and his attorney, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarcone </PERSON>, did not return a message. No date has been set for <PERSON> George </PERSON> to appear in court. He was not arrested.

 A political consulting firm led by two top officials in <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign has offered to represent the government of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, citing the firm's ability to work in `` the transitional environment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. `` Given the fragile environment in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and the ensuing presidential election in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> there exists a window of opportunity for us to combine our resources and energies for the mutual benefit of our two countries,'' stated the letter from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> & amp; Co. The letter, dated Oct. 12, also expressed hope that <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> would `` retain our services.'' The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> firm is run by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign officials <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is unrelated to the vice president, and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. The letter to <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> appeared to be signed by <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but he told the newspaper Monday that his name had been signed by an associate without his permission or his knowledge. `` This upsets me very much,'' he said. `` This was totaly unauthorized. I want nothing to do with the government of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>.'' The switchboard operator at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said no one was available late Monday for comment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 39, is deputy finance chairman of the vice president's election campaign He was a White House staffer and the vice president's deputy chief of staff during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> is both <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president and finance director for this year's <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential bid. She was on the finance committee for the Reagan-Bush 1984 re-election campaign. The letter sent by <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> offered <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> a variety of lobbying services and said, `` We are confident that we can effectively work in the transitional environment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to assist <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged he was aware the Haitian government `` had requested information about the company several weeks ago,'' but he said he wanted no part of any subsequent discussions. `` I specifically said that I would not be involved,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he has not been active in the company for the past two years because of his fund-raising duties for the vice president. An attachment to the two-page letter, however, promoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential campaign and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s background as a White House staffer Six weeks ago <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s regime ousted the government that had been having trouble conducting a peaceful election. After a November 1987 election was canceled because of violence, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government cut off $ 89 million in aid. Only food and development aid has continued through international humanitarian organizations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, while pleased with recent steps taken by <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to improve the political climate and reign in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s military, have said there is little prospect of renewing the full foreign-aid package until the new administration and the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> take office in January.

<HEAD>Utilities Vote To Settle In Giant Securities Fraud Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM KLAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fourteen public utilities across <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state voted Monday to approve a $ 226 million settlement letting them out of the giant <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> securities fraud trial in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` It's a -LRB- settlement -RRB- we can certainly live with and handle, and it wo n't have great diverse ... impact on our state,'' said <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Malanca </PERSON>, who engineered the complex agreement involving utilities, the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. While several utilities agreeing to the settlement on Monday said rate increases may be necessary, they added that those increases would be small and the economic damage to the Northwest region minimal. Under terms of the agreement, the 14 utilities would pay $ 181 million, <ORGANIZATION> BPA </ORGANIZATION> and the federal government would pay $ 35 million and the state would pay $ 10 million to plaintiffs who sued after <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> defaulted in 1983 on $ 2.25 billion in bonds used to build two nuclear power plants. The plaintiffs include more than 24,000 past and present bondholders. The plants were begun but never finished after regional energy planners determined power from the plants would n't be needed. The region's economy suffered when <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> attempted to build five multibillion dollar nuclear power plants and finished only one. In <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> announced the state would pay $ 10 million toward the settlement, if the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> concurs. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state faces a separate lawsuit involving the same plaintiffs. <ORGANIZATION> BPA </ORGANIZATION> participation still requires the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected this week, and final approval will have to come from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, who is overseeing the trial in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. The pact leaves <ORGANIZATION> Snohomish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> the only utility remaining as a defendant in the trial, although it has an option to settle until Nov. 10. Snohomish contracted for the biggest single share, 13 percent, on the two terminated <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> plants. The trial, over the largest municipal bond default in history, was recessed last week in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> when attorneys reported a settlement was possible. It was scheduled to resume Wednesday. Besides Snohomish, other defendants remaining include two engineering firms and a financial adviser firm. The price for Snohomish if it takes up the Nov. 10 option would be $ 48.7 million. That would be in line with the $ 3.7 million per-percentage-point of interest in the two abandoned nuclear plants other defendant utilities agreed to pay. <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> director of utilities <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Coates </PERSON> said the settlement would bring to $ 591 million the amount paid to the class of plaintiffs in the giant federal lawsuit. Settlements during the past year have removed most defendants and totaled $ 365 million in cash. In addition to the $ 591 million would be $ 96 million in contested insurance claims. <PERSON> Coates </PERSON> estimated the settlement would add 3 -LCB- to 4 percent to <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> City Light's expenses. He said the city planned to pay the bill through floating long-term bonds. Under terms of the agreements, most utilities would have to make initial payments Dec. 15, with final payments Dec. 15, 1989. Interest would be paid, according to the agreement. The settlement memorandum noted some utilities could recover substantial amounts through insurance carriers that have so far `` refused to pay the insurance coverage contracted for.''

 A prosecutor filed an $ 800 million defamation lawsuit Monday against <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, the black teen-ager who a grand jury said concocted a story of abduction and rape by six white men. <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON>' lawsuit also named as defendants the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and lawyers <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, advisers to <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> who had claimed that <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON> was involved in the purported attack last November.

Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> never cooperated with the grand jury, and her advisers dismissed the resulting report as the product of a racist system. `` I hope he goes through with it,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said in response to the lawsuit Monday. `` Well, I think that Mr. <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON> has the potential of making history in being the first man to sue himself into jail,'' he said. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> would tell her story in court and, along with other witnesses, would prove <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON>' involvement. `` He will be proven guilty of rape and sodomy and will go to jail,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> had no comment on the lawsuit, according to a receptionist at his law office. <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> did not immediately return telephone calls for comment. <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, also did not return telephone calls. <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON> had said at a news conference on Oct. 10 that he intended to file suit.

A report on state-run television Monday said six separate clouds of the crop-devouring insects were in the city, but that the ministry was using helicopters to bring the situation under control.

<HEAD>Shipyard Closure Seen as Attempt to Cripple Solidarity</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Whatever sense it may make on solely economic grounds, the decision to shut the <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> shipyard is a slap at the Solidarity trade union movement at a time the government ostensibly is seeking dialogue. The closing poses a difficult challenge for union leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who has been preaching economic reform but undoubtedly did not want it to begin by eliminating his workplace and political base. Monday's announcement follows closely a government demand that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> remove two longtime Solidarity advisers from his delegation to promised `` round-table'' talks with authorities, which were to start in mid-October. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> refused and the talks now appear in jeopardy. The developments underscore an end to the accommodative mood on both sides that briefly seemed to dominate Polish politics after <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> ended a series of strikes in early September in exchange for the promise of the talks on Solidarity's future. The government has taken a more energetic, decisive tone since the ascension to prime minister last month of <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, the party propaganda chief and a longtime Solidarity foe. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> has said the situation is too urgent to wait for talks with the opposition before trying to revitalize the economy. But the opposition, which has long distrusted <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, questions whether he is interested in talks at all. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said in a broadcast interview Monday that the decision to close the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard Dec. 1 and liquidate it over the next year was purely economic and had `` nothing to do with Solidarity.'' The official media gave heavy coverage to the decision, but made no mention of the shipyard's symbolic importance as the birthplace and stronghold of the only independent labor movement allowed in the Soviet bloc. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the state-owned shipyard, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s largest, has been losing money and increasingly draining the public treasury. But <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said it was no coincidence that the shipyard was the first industrial enterprise in the country to fall victim to the budget ax. `` Premier <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s decision was not dictated by economic reasons,'' he said, calling the move <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s `` personal provocation'' against the yard where Solidarity sprang to life in August 1980 after a nationwide strike wave. While vowing to fight the closing, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he agreed the `` economy needs restructuring and basic changes. Solidarity is and has been for those changes.'' But he said the yard could be saved by dismissing incompetent managers and allowing workers to run it more efficiently themselves. Historian <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, a close <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> adviser, said Solidarity always was prepared to accept painful economic choices in the course of reform. But those steps were supposed to be a subject for agreement in the now-delayed talks with authorities, he said. By deciding unilaterally to close the shipyard, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> `` either buried the chances for the round table or considered the round table already buried,'' <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said. `` If such decisions are taken without first achieving a social contract, then what one wants to prove is that there is no need for such a way, no need for dialogue.'' One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the government's move a political `` masterstroke''. If Solidarity strikes, it will lend credence to <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s argument that the union is unreasonable and poses an obstacle to efforts to reform <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s inefficient, debt-ridden economy And by shutting down the shipyard, the strikers would only be hastening what the government wants to do next month anyway. But if Solidarity does not mount a protest to defend its home base, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the Solidarity leadership run the risk of seeming toothless to militant followers at home and would-be supporters abroad. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first major plant closing is likely to send shock waves through factories nationwide. But because the closing was announced during a four-day holiday weekend, it was difficult to immediately judge the degree of public sympathy for the workers. The government, meanwhile, was trying to take the sting out of the closure for the approximately 10,000 workers facing layoffs. It said state enterprises have far more than enough jobs going begging in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> province at equal or higher pay. And it promised free job retraining for those who need it. Ironically and perhaps not accidentally, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> made the move only days before Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is due to arrive for a visit that is to include a trip to <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> to see <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Friday. Official commentators have been drawing parallels between <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s plans to overhaul <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy and the toughness shown by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in facing down the unions and cutting back money-losing state industry in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

 Anti-personnel mines designed to maim an enemy remain scattered about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and must be cleared before more than 5 million refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> can return home, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials say. The mines are estimated to range in number from hundreds of thousands to 5 million. Some look like toys and are small enough to fit in the palm of a person's hand. If picked up, they can blow away a hand; if stepped on, a victim can lose a foot. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> and Humanitarian Program for Afghan refugees, said the landmines have to be found and defused before a billion-dollar rebuilding program can begin. The devices are believed to have been laid by Soviet and Afghan government forces during their nine-year war against Moslem insurgents. The insurgents also have laid a number of anti-tank devices. Teams of mine-clearing experts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> have been in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to plan a training program designed to show Afghans how to locate, identify and defuse the mines. A $ 9-million training program is scheduled to begin shortly, <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON> said. Clearing the mines `` is a pre-requisite to any -LRB- rebuilding -RRB- activity,'' said <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON>. The Soviets are not a contributor to the mine-clearing effort, but they `` have assured us of their total cooperation,'' said <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON>. Since the April signing of an accord providing for the withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has begun mobilizing for one of the largest refugee movements in its history. <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON> said the widespread use of the landmines `` is a comment on the people who make, sell, buy and use them.'' The U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION>, have been fighting the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government since it seized power in 1978. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> entered the conflict in December 1979. Fifteen different types of anti-personnel mines have been identified along with five models of anti-tank mines, <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON> said. In addition to the anti-personnel devices that resemble toys are are scattered around villages, another common type is a bright green plastic device that looks like a butterfly and fits into the palm of a hand. <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON> said unexploded ordnance of other kinds, such as dud bombs, also are scattered around the Afghan countryside. The first task of foreign mine-detecting experts will be to make Afghans aware of what to look for. <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON> said children will be educated to the dangers as well. Foreign experts will train Afghans who in turn will pass on their knowledge to others, he said. Eventually, said <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON>, an Afghan mine-clearing team would be established in most villages or cluster of villages.

<HEAD>Emperor's Condition Called Stable After Weekend Hemorrhaging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> discharged small amounts of blood early today and his blood pressure fell, but palace officials described the 87-year-old monarch's condition as stable after a serious weekend setback. Palace spokesman <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> discharged blood early today but added that doctors did not administer another transfusion. He told reporters that palace physicians described the discharge as remnants of blood lost Saturday night and Sunday morning. The world's longest reigning monarch has been bedridden since falling ill with internal hemorrhaging on Sept. 19. Despite a drop in the emperor's blood pressure today, <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said doctors were not `` particularly concerned.'' He said the emperor was fully conscious this morning, chatting with his physicians. On Sunday, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s blood pressure had dropped dangerously low and he received a total of 3.8 pints of blood in the largest transfusion since becoming bedridden. Since Sept. 19, the emperor has received 31.5 pints of blood, about three times the normal amount in his body. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has not taken any solid food since falling ill, with the exception of a few spoons of porridge. He is being fed intravenously, receiving some 600-700 calories daily. Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny media reports that the emperor has pancreatic cancer.

<TEXT>
 The Taylor Highway, a rib-jarring gravel washboard that snakes through mining hills northeast of this interior <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> village, does n't rate much mention in the tourist brochures. But the <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> is <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Champagne </PERSON>'s specialty. He drives a tow truck and, as they say in the trade, business is picking up. He sat the other day in his <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> station and pointed out the highway's latest victim: a van with a crushed roof and shattered windows `` He was passing a motor home on a curve, got over too far, and t-h-p-p-t, into the river,'' he said. Champagne was happy to haul the van and its uninjured driver back to Tok, for $ 700. A 1984 legislative study found that 60 percent of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> highways were in fair to poor condition. But the potholes and frost heaves do n't slow the flow of vacationers. Growing herds of tourists not only keep Champagne smiling but also help fuel debate over this frontier state's transportation future. More roads! say business leaders who see a young and developing state with little access to remote villages and mineral deposits. Stop the bulldozers! cry environmentalists who see a pristine land needing protection from the forces that paved over the lower 48 states. The arguments likely will continue as long as there are places people can not drive to, and much of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> fits that category. The state's 11,600 miles of roads are concentrated in the southeastern quarter, leaving vast areas untracked. One-fourth of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s half-million residents live unconnected by road to the outside world. Of 151 incorporated communities, 133 are unconnected, including the state capital of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. Given the mountains and permanently frozen ground that cover much of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, it's a wonder roads were ever built. Turn-of-the-century gold rushes spurred the first major construction. In World War II, concerns about a Japanese invasion prompted another building frenzy; the 1,520-mile <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s first overland link to the lower 48, was finished in just nine months. Since statehood in 1959, expansion has continued steadily. The latest road, completed this summer in northwestern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, is a 54-mile link from the coast to a mineral deposit known as Red Dog. `` I try not to think about that,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, state representative for the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which unsuccessfully fought the road's route through <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Krusenstern </LOCATION> National Monument. She said wilderness is easily destroyed by roads and resulting development and pollution. She cited the 416-mile <LOCATION> Dalton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, built in 1974 to link Fairbanks and the <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> oil fields. Although only the highway's southern half is open to the public, lax enforcement lets many drivers slip through to the north, and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> worries about the effect on wildlife. `` Increased access means increased poaching, and there definitely has been poaching along the road. The road lets in people, hunters, who would n't have been there otherwise,'' she said. Letting more people into <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> is what economic boosters have had in mind for years. Wherever roads have gone, tourism has followed. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> officials say 38,150 vehicles _ about 70 percent of them motor homes and campers _ entered the state on the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Highway last year. Roads can cut shipping costs to villages and make remote mining more competitive, say the boosters, who over the years have proposed dozens of roads to fill blank spaces on the map. In 1977, travel guides called the 152-mile <LOCATION> Elliott </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION> the `` Road to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>,'' even though it dead-ended, and still does, 500 miles short of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> town. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairbanks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> suggested a road that would head 200 miles southwest from <LOCATION> Denali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, then swing north another 200 miles to the <LOCATION> Yukon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. In southeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, plans surface occasionally to connect <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> to highways that now stop in <LOCATION> Haines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION>. But such projects, each estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, are distant dreams for state officials who can barely raise the $ 52 million needed each year to maintain existing roads. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s oil-dependent government has grown cautious since the oil boom busted, and the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> plans no major highway expansion. It would cost $ 600 million just to bring <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s rural highways up to standards, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lind </PERSON>, the agency's planning and budget director. Patterns of land use and ownership also discourage road-building. National parks, preserves and monuments now cover 50 million of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s 375 million acres. Natives, protective of open space needed for subsistence hunting and fishing, own 44 million acres. But things could change quickly in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s boom-bust economy. As publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Henning </PERSON> wrote in an <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Geographic book called `` Adventure Roads North'': `` Strong anti-roads sentiments of environmentalist groups have slowed Alaskan road construction, but in the history of the North, there has ever been the cry for ` more roads, more trails,' and it is inevitable that the road building will continue. ... Like it or not, it seems to be the American way.'' Wherever and whenever roads are built, the likes of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Champagne </PERSON> will be there to pick up the pieces. Back at the <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> station, Champagne was smiling again; a Winnebago driver was in for the second time that day with a flat tire. Champagne quickly fixed the tire and proceeded to the cash register. `` That'll be $ 10,'' he said. `` You have a nice day.''

 The City of Light sits on a subterranean city of darkness, a vast network of stone quarries that has given refuge to scoundrels, saints and the bones of 6 million souls. It is where the Phantom of the Opera set up house. Here is a report by an AP correspondent who visited the catacombs.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Phantom was laid to rest long ago in the cellars of the Opera, but figures nearly as macabre still haunt the catacombs that wind through the belly of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> like entrails and conceal millions of human bones. Each weekend, dozens of people slip out of their city skins and into the maze on which the city rests. They descend as far as 90 feet into a world where night is eternal, the unexpected waits at each turn and the game is to the fearless. Some are history buffs seeking the dank breath of ancient <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, others are adventurers and still others inhabit a marginal world whether above ground or below. They are called `` cataphiles'' and are drawn, as if by enchantment, to the darkness beneath the City of Light. They tread in the footsteps of sorcerers, bandits, smugglers, the quick and the sly who haunted the tunnels centuries ago. Many who spend time below use nicknames _ `` Destroy,'' `` Calamity'' or `` Professor <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>'' _ and dress in exaggerated punk or skinhead style. The eternal, eerie silence and stillness enclose a voyager who weaves through the sand-colored maze of galleries, rooms, nooks and niches as if pulled along by the flashlight beam. Fossils of ancient creatures are imbedded in walls nicked by the pickaxes of workers long dead. Minuscule stalactites have formed on the dripping ceilings of what once were quarries for the limestone that built <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, most of them worked in the Middle Ages. During World War II, the catacombs were bunkers for the German occupiers and hideouts for the French Resistance. They have been a blessing to mushroom growers who harvested tons of `` champignons de <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>'' each day from the murky gardens. `` It's a milieu that is such an anachronism compared with the rest of the capital,'' said Inspector <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Saratte </PERSON>, director of police operations in the catacombs. It has been against the law to go underground since 1955 because of risks both to travelers and the city's foundations, but <PERSON> Saratte </PERSON> said: `` It's an adventure ... so everyone goes down, from sons of Cabinet ministers to little punks.'' Quarries of <LOCATION> Lutecian </LOCATION> limestone running under southern <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, just a corner of the 188 miles of accessible catacombs, are assigned to the dead. The galleries are lined with the skulls and other bones of 6 million people, some guillotined in the French Revolution but most merely overflow from the crowded cemeteries of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anne-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leparmentier </PERSON>, a geologist with the General Inspection of the Quarries, the city agency in charge since the 18th century, said a `` reserve'' of bones is kept in other sections of the quarries, but `` sometimes a skull disappears'' now that the cataphiles have come. People have had regular access since the last century to the bone caverns at the <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Denfert-Rochereau </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and regular tours are conducted. The rest of the catacombs are reached by manhole, under cover of darkness, down a steel ladder to another world. Going underground became a fad more than a decade ago when students of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> nearly made it a ritual. `` We ended up spending days finding people lost inside,'' <PERSON> Saratte </PERSON> said, so all but eight of about 300 accesses to the catacombs have been soldered shut. The quarries are the lowest level of subterranean <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, which also is honeycombed with subway lines and 1,313 miles of navigable sewers. The vast underworld inspired <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, and later <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroux </PERSON>, whose `` Phantom of the Opera'' hid out in `` that infernal underground maze.'' Around one corner is a bath carved into the rock by quarry workers centuries ago, around the next an open well that may descend to the center of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Around still another, `` Lost in the catas. Help!'' is scrawled on the wall. Some writings reek of threat or foreboding: `` This is the domain of the Klan,'' `` Avenue of the Black Mass,'' `` I'm Dead.'' A shuffling sound comes from a corridor nearby. The path forks and the swamp route beckons. Travelers slosh through the ancient mud of <LOCATION> Lutecia </LOCATION>, as <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> was called in Roman times. Eras collide in the catacombs. Punks, skinheads and weekend revelers hold all-night seances. In Room Z, a large, confusing, amorphous cavity reached by slithering on the stomach through a narrow tunnel, the walls are scrolls of obscenities, swastikas and death wails. Subterranean <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is `` a very particular little world, a little planet all its own'' where groups of regulars establish zones of influence, said <PERSON> Saratte </PERSON>, the police inspector. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, who uses only his first name, said: `` This world is divided into two races, the tourists and the cataphiles. The tourists are a hated race. ... You have to do everything to chase them out.'' `` Actually, it is a rather hostile milieu'' where `` criminals do n't think of hiding out, said <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON>, another geologist for the city quarries agency. Since the beginning, the quarries of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> have attracted those either in hiding or in search of the celestial or the damned. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denis </PERSON>, patron saint of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said Mass in the quarries during the Christian persecution, according to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacordaire </PERSON>'s book `` The Secret History of Subterranean <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Some 13th century bandits hid under the Chateau de Vauvert, replaced long ago by the <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lacordaire </PERSON> said. Sorcerers used the quarries for black masses, especially during the 1348 plague that filled the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> cemeteries and caused the living to search for solace in the occult. In the last century, merchants used the catacombs to smuggle untaxed black-market goods to clients. Official concern now centers on preserving the natural beauty of the quarries and fears that unauthorized travelers will harm the city foundations. `` There have always been cataphiles, but perhaps in the past they were more respectful,'' <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> said. `` It is not a sacred place, but it is our patrimony.'' Over-ambitious excavations weakened the subterranean infrastructure. There were reports a century ago of the earth swallowing homes on the Boulevard St. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> and neighboring streets. <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> said the last fatal accident was a 1961 cave-in at <LOCATION> Clamart </LOCATION>, a southern suburb, that killed 20 people. Authorities began mapping and reinforcing the quarries in the mid-18th century and do so today when the need arises. Quarrying has been prohibited since 1788.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Unimpressed with sweeping Soviet reform and demands for change at home, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders are holding firm to policies pursued since 1968, when `` Prague Spring'' reforms were crushed. Tough police reaction to a mass protest in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on Friday and to a demonstration in August signaled that authorities will not tolerate public expressions of a desire for more freedom. For the thousands of peaceful protesters, the mass rallies could strengthen their resolve in demanding a more democratic society. The next public show of support for such demands is likely to come on International Human Rights Day on Dec. 10. A demonstration called that day last year by the Charter 77 human rights movement attracted a few thousand people. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was an independent democracy for 20 years before World War II and has a long tradition of civil movements predating independence in 1918. The 70th anniversary of that independence was the occasion for Friday's rally in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, 24 hours after the authorities organized their own mass celebration of the anniversary for the first time in four decades of Communist rule. The two events were sharply contrasting, with the official rally seeming ritualized and the banned independent gathering appearing a more genuine expression of national sentiment, dissident filmmaker <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Milota </PERSON> noted in an interview. `` The government, at their rally, did n't sing the national anthem, which was played by an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> band and sung by an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> choir'' and not taken up by the organized, massed crowd, <PERSON> Milota </PERSON> noted. By contrast, on Friday, thousands sang the national anthem with great feeling before riot police with truncheons marched down the square toward a core of hundreds of protesters who stood their ground. The authorities have made clear they will seek no contact with such people or unofficial groups, as Communist officials tentatively have in neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` There can be no dialogue here,'' <ORGANIZATION> Prague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party chief <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> told Thursday's official rally. At 43, <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo, is one of a new generation of Communist leaders slowly rising into the ruling elite in a reshuffle by <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, who took over as party chief from <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> in December. Czechoslovaks had few expectations of reform from <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, who oversaw the purge of an estimated half million Communists from the party after August 1968, when Soviet and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks put an end to the `` Prague Spring'' reform of <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>. A reshuffle this month confirmed <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and his allies do not intend to follow Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> into sweeping economic or political reforms. The leading proponent of change in the top elite, <PERSON> Lubomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON>, lost his Politburo seat and his post as premier. According to a Czechoslovak source, his replacement, <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, was one of a group of party members who backed Soviet criticism of <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> before the 1968 invasion. The reshuffle also saw the first professional policeman named Interior Minister. <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kincl </PERSON>, who had overall responsibility for Friday's tough police action and the strict security in force for days beforehand, is a former police chief in northern and central <LOCATION> Moravia </LOCATION>, two areas known as the toughest on dissidents. The police action and detention of at least 85 dissidents in one of the biggest pre-emptive crackdowns nationwide in years stood in stark contrast to Soviet policy as presented a few days earlier by West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. He announced that all Soviet political prisoners would be freed by the end of the year. Other Western nations greeted that announcement with skepticism. But recent Soviet policy does contrast with the trend in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> toward what one <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> resident summed up as `` retrenchment.'' The dissident community, meanwhile, is inching forward to more overt political activity. Charter 77 has been primarily a human rights movement, a loose association of an estimated 1,300 signatories who issue documents on Czechoslovak society and history and include former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members who still believe in Socialism and many intellectuals who do not. Earlier this month, several leading Chartists, including banned playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, joined a new <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>, which has formulated 11 demands for a multiparty democracy and a largely denationalized economy.

<DATELINE>HERAT, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As the pink-tinged sunset fades over ruins of bombed-out houses, and kerosene lanterns start twinkling through the darkness, the gunfire begins. It lasts until sunrise, to be followed intermittently through the day by the more distant boom of rockets aimed at the city. <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s third-largest city with a population of 106,000, is one of the cities the Moscow-backed government considers `` safe'' because Soviet troops are still present. The government professes to be able to defend the city against U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas known as mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, even after the Soviet pullout scheduled this winter. The designation `` safe'' appears to be a delusion, if not an outright fraud. The guerrillas are about 12 to 13 miles from the city, according to <PERSON> Juma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, provincial commander of the <LOCATION> Sarandoy </LOCATION>, a paramilitary armored force considered more loyal and better-trained than the Afghan army's rank and file. But the outgoing fire at night in <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> seems aimed at an enemy much closer. Most of what can be heard from the balcony of a government building on the northern edge of the city sounds no bigger than .50 - caliber _ whose range is about 1 -LCB- The mortars used by Sarandoy troops in <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>'s 14th century citadel show signs of recent firing and are of the type that has a maximum range of about five miles. In the Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, non-Soviet bloc diplomats predict <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> will fall quickly to the mujahedeen after Soviet troops pull out in accordance with a U.N.-mediated accord. The withdrawal must be completed by Feb. 15. But Soviet troops left <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> this past summer and the mujahedeen still have not dislodged the Afghan garrison and taken that city, the largest in the country after <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital. Rockets also land in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> several times a week, sometimes by the scores. Most of the time the damage is insignificant. But the cities are vulnerable, more to siege tactics than to any direct military attack the mujahedeen can mount with their poorly targeted rockets. The capture of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> would deal a major psychological blow to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-style government. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s mountains afford sanctuary to the mujahedeen but it is the cities they must capture. Whether they can achieve victory through direct military attacks, the mujahedeen are in a good position to isolate the cities from their supplies of food, fuel and military reinforcements. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> gets a periodic taste of this when the mujahedeen cut the roads leading to the capital, causing sugar to disappear from the markets and doubling the prices of dwindling stocks of flour. <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> is even more vulnerable. Fuel comes from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a two-hour drive up the 95-mile highway to the Afghan border town of <LOCATION> Torghundi </LOCATION> when the road is not blocked by winter snows or year-round guerrillas. The fuel is needed not only for automobiles, which are outnumbered in <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> by horse-drawn vehicles and bicycles, but for heating, cooking and running the city's power plant. The plan provides electricity only from sundown to sunrise and only for the few relatively prosperous neighborhoods, government institutions and hospitals. <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> has never had around-the-clock electricity, not even before the war That began a decade ago when a coup-installed communist government took power and quickly required Soviet assistance to survive. The guerrillas surrounding <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> are led by one of the mujahedeen's ablest commanders, <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of the seven Pakistani-based guerrilla groups. Main roads and bridges around the city are now guarded by Soviet troops. Sarandoy commander <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> said he has 4,000 men in <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> province, 600 of them in <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> city. In addition, he said, there are 2,000 government-paid village militiamen and 4,000 `` Defenders of the Revolution,'' gun-toting civilians the government pays $ 4.75 to $ 7.15 a month. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> said he had no idea how many mujahedeen were outside the city. `` Their activity is too secret. It is difficult to say,'' he said in an interview in his office where the second-story windows were bricked up and sandbagged.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Last year, after more than 1,500 people died in the collision of a packed ferry and an oil tanker, investigations concluded that government agencies and shipowners habitually ignored maritime safety measures. Last week's sinking of the ferry <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> during a typhoon showed little has changed, despite sea disasters that have killed thousands of people and left hundreds missing in the past year. `` Largely a seafaring people living in an archipelago, Filipinos rightfully expect a government attentive to the needs of sea travel,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> study said in April. `` Instead, they find a government disorganized in its treatment of sea travel and the shipping industry.'' It speculated that neglect of the public safety in shipping was probably due to the fact that most who travel by sea are poor and can not afford plane fares. The House of Representatives noted in another study that most of the 588 ports throughout the island nation were designed primarily to handle cargo and none has a passenger terminal. The reports followed separate investigations by the two chambers into the December crash of the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> and an oil tanker. Official reports put the death toll at about 1,700, but most estimates placed the actual figure at more than 3,000. Only 28 survived. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> report said that despite frequent fatal accidents, the government had done so little that when the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> sank, `` the bureaucracy had little to offer except knee-jerk reactions and confusion.'' Despite pledges by shipowners and authorities to enforce rules on manifesting passengers, neither knew the precise number of people aboard when Typhoon Ruby sank the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, the sister ship of the Dona Paz. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> recorded 379 passengers and 60 crew members. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> Go, president and general manager <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, which owned the ferry, said 451 passengers and 66 crewmen were on the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> when it left <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Oct. 23 for the central Philippine port of <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION>. By Sulpicio's count, at most 20 people were not listed on the manifest. But <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers said at least 52 survivors were not on the list. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ordered an investigation, saying that among other things she wanted to know `` why they sailed despite very bad weather.'' <PERSON> Commodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Pio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrido </PERSON>, commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which clears commercial ships for sailing to ensure safety regulations are followed, said <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> was allowed to sail because `` the weather was clear in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>.'' Previous warnings by the government's weather service showed the ship's destination was in <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>'s path. <PERSON> Garrido </PERSON> said nothing in maritime regulations prevents a vessel from sailing if there is bad weather at its destination. The investigations of the Dona Paz disaster showed virtually everything was wrong with the shipping industry. Both laid most of the blame on government neglect and apathy. Both reports said that not only was there a shortage of ships, but communications equipment and navigational aids were obsolete and personnel poorly trained. In addition, maritime safety regulations could not be enforced because of corruption and overlapping regulatory agencies, the reports said. The reports noted that up to seven agencies were overseeing the shipping industry so that responsibility could easily be passed from one to the other. It said corruption was such that operators could obtain lincenses for even the most unseaworthy vessels by bribing licensing officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> expressed surprise that despite the country's heavy dependence on water transport, only a total of $ 150 million had been invested in all aspects of the shipping industry. It cited figures from the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> showing that in 1986 the country had 3,000 vessels `` of different sizes, configurations and uses,'' which moved a total of 16 million passengers and 39.6 million tons of cargo. It said the average annual maritime death toll of 152 between 1980-87 was already bad enough before the <ORGANIZATION> Dona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paz </ORGANIZATION> disaster raised it to 508 per annum. The figure does not include hundreds of accidents involving unregistered outriggers in rural areas. Despite Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s promise of an investigation, the Philippine press has been skeptical that improvements will be made. `` After every sea disaster, there is usually a lot of talk about reforms in the shipping and maritime industry,'' wrote The Philippine Star columnist <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Borjal </PERSON>. `` But after all is said and done, nothing much really happens. And when another sea tragedy takes place, the vicious cycle is repeated.''

<TEXT>
 Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> took on the architectural establishment in his own television documentary and gained a powerful vote of confidence from ordinary citizens, newspapers, and even some architects. A newspaper survey showed that more than 75 percent of Britons agreed with the prince's views that many architects and developers ignore people's wishes and build ugly, characterless buildings that are unpleasant to live in. However, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, director general of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architects </ORGANIZATION>, responded Sunday that `` there is too much hypocrisy ... and we are not going to allow architects to be made scapegoats.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' maiden venture into television writing and performing was an outspoken and often humorous return to the subject of modern architecture, which he has discussed publicly for several years. He has angered leading architects and raised complaints that a member of the royal family has no business publicizing such views. With 75 minutes of uninterrupted television time on the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday night, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> took a more positive approach, showing viewers new buildings and developments he admired. But his criticism of others was severe. Glancing at a low, stark-white structure among Victorian buildings at the edge of the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> commented: `` That's redolent of a word processor to me, and I do n't see that people particularly want to live looking at a word processor.'' The Sunday Telegraph newspaper called the show a tour de force that established the 39-year-old heir to the throne as a `` great communicator.'' The Observer said it was admirable, and <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> wished <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> luck in a `` genuinely popular crusade.'' Other Britons seemed to agree. `` He follows what the ordinary man in the street believes, I think, about <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>: it is being drowned out by skyscrapers,'' said an unidentified woman in a TV interview Saturday. In its poll by <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surveys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the Sunday Express said 75.5 percent of 1,000 people in a nationally representative sample agreed with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>. Almost 88 percent thought it right for members of the royal family to speak out on such issues. No margin of error was given. <PERSON> Denys </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasdun </PERSON>, architect of the concrete National Theater, was asked by a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> interviewer whether the prince should voice his opinions in public. `` Of course he should ... so should anybody, it's a public art,'' <PERSON> Lasdun </PERSON> said. `` But because everyone shoots their mouth off, it does n't mean ... they talk sense.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> called <PERSON> Lasdun </PERSON>'s creation `` a clever way of building a nuclear power station in the middle of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> without anyone objecting.'' He called a projected <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> development by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON> `` rather like a 1930s wireless -LRB- radio -RRB-.'' `` I can only say, ` God bless the Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> God </PERSON> save us from his architectural judgment,''' responded <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON>, new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which allocates state funds to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s arts. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architects </ORGANIZATION>, defended the latest generation of architects. He said they have `` no greater love than the prince for much of what happened 20 or more years ago.'' <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, the only architect in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, backed <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> in his attack on `` ugly, multi-story slabs of concrete.'' But the legislator said they were principally the fault of politicians who rushed to rebuild cities damaged in World War II. In its page-one editorial, The Sunday Telegraph said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> could become a major television personality. `` It will only take a few more charismatic performances like last week's for him to hold the nation in the palm of his hand,'' the newspaper said.

<HEAD>No Pre-Election Indictments in Pentagon Fraud Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The prosecutor in a massive defense contracting probe says the complexity of the case _ not politics _ will delay indictments until after the Nov. 8 election. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who is coordinating the multistate investigation, also said indictments could continue for a year as a result of a probe into the $ 150-billion-a-year <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> purchasing system. A federal grand jury resumes meeting Nov. 15, so indictments could come then, which would be about five months after the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> revealed the investigation by searching more than 40 premises across the country. `` I am very optimistic on November indictments,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. Information about the case has been scarce because prosecutors have sealed most search warrants and affidavits. The investigation centers on whether private consultants, many of them former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees, paid bribes to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials for inside information about contracts, chiefly within the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, a Republican, denied any suggestion that indictments were slowed so that Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could not make them an issue in his campaign against Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to hand down indictments in the first part of October,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said in an interview. But the prosecutor said the case has been `` administratively complex'' with attorneys forced to examine about 700,000 documents and listen to `` thousands and thousands of tapes of two years of telephone interceptions.'' Federal and defense sources also indicate <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s staff has been kept waiting for answers from some potential defendants who have been offered plea bargains. Adding to the task was the time-consuming process of gathering financial evidence from foreign bank accounts, which <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> described as an `` always delicate issue.'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said there were good reasons for thoroughness, including the `` high national visibility'' of the case, and the propensity for judges in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to schedule trials shortly after indictments are returned. `` I will not present this indictment until we are ready for trial, and we feel we will be ready ... within the next month,'' he said. As the case evolves, indictments and trials could be held in other cities, sources said. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> did not discuss charges that could be filed. But the use of <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents on the case suggests that tax charges may be contemplated in addition to the more obvious counts of theft of government property, bribery, fraud and conspiracy to defraud the government. Fifteen attorneys, some of them working 12-hour days and weekends, plus 75 federal agents from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> have been assigned to the case, which <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> called, `` the largest case ever handled in the eastern district of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> refused to say how many indictments he expected to be returned initially, but noted that courtroom space generally confines the number to less than 12. Though <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> declined to name the targets of the investigation, he did not rule out members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` All individuals that may have been engaged in wrongdoing or committed a criminal act in connection with the defense procurement process will be scrutinized and prosecuted if appropriate,'' he said. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> disputed reports that he had told members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during the summer that none was a target. `` I never made such a statement,'' he said. `` I told the members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> that no member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had been the subject of electronic surveillance, had received a subpoena to testify in front of the grand jury at that time or had been the subject of a search warrant,'' he said. Court papers filed in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, indicate prosecutors are looking at allegations that campaign contributions were extorted. Raids in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> came at the business of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, who set up the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to make contributions that might help area defense contractors, and at the home of <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> official identified as turning over contributions to Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, D-Md., who sits on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. The name of another committee member, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, has also surfaced in connection with the probe. <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> says he has done nothing wrong. Among those whose names have been linked to the investigation are five <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, including <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, deputy assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary for acquisition and management; <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, a consultant who was assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for research, engineering and systems before leaving government in 1987, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, another defense consultant.

<HEAD>USDA Economist Predicts Bumper Crops Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This year's drought is not likely to be repeated in 1989, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers probably will harvest bumper crops of wheat, corn and soybeans, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist. Corn production, for example, could nearly double from this year's drought-riddled yield. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> warned that a backlog of demand will siphon off most of the 1989 crop increases without allowing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to rebuild its stockpiles significantly. `` Production of all commodities almost certainly will be much greater next year, but consumption of wheat, corn and soybeans also will remain high, resulting in only limited increases in stocks during 1989-90,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. The odds are good for such a harvest improvement in 1989, he said. Since 1970, drought has shriveled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crops five times _ 1970, 1974, 1980, 1983 and 1988 _ and in each case harvest yields were up significantly the following year. According to <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s analysis, which was prepared for the November issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, 1989 wheat production may rebound to about 2.5 billion bushels from 1.8 billion bushels this year; corn to 7.5 billion to 8 billion bushels from 4.4 billion in 1988; and soybeans to almost 2 billion bushels from this year's harvest of 1.5 billion. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the larger crops of 1989 `` will be used to sustain growing consumption'' by domestic and foreign users. Therefore, he added, inventories `` may rise only slightly'' by the end of the 1989-90 crop year. `` The real impact of the drought _ markedly reduced stocks _ will remain for some time to come,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` Some rebuilding of inventories that had been severely depleted in 1988-89 is expected, but gains will be small. Larger increases, if desired, will take more time.'' Despite the odds that the 1988 drought will not be repeated next year, the possibility still exists, no matter how unsavory the subject is for <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit research organization based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, recently said that another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drought in 1989 would trigger a `` desperate scramble'' by needy countries for dwindling grain supplies. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> explained further about drought's track record in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and how it backs up his contention that 1989 may be a bumper crop year. `` Unlike other countries, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not had back-to-back droughts in at least 75 years,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recently endured as many as four successive years of drought. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weather history and prospects give little reason to believe that crop yields will not rebound next year.'' Moreover, he said, rainfall in September and October has helped replenish badly depleted soil moisture in parts of the corn and soybean belts, and across the Southeast. Long-term forecasts call for average or slightly above-average chances for normal precipitation this fall. `` Even so, most of the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and Southeast still require as much as 6 to 10 inches of rainfall this fall and winter to restore soil moisture to more normal levels,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` Temperatures are likely to be somewhat higher than normal.'' Some other reasons cited by Cole for expecting 1989 crop production to rise sharply: _ The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has used provisions of the 1985 farm law to reduce the amount of land farmers must idle in order to qualify for price supports and other program benefits, including `` deficiency'' payments, or direct subsidies For 1989, as an example, only 10 percent of a farmer's feed grain base acreage will have to be set aside, compared with 20 percent this year. Wheat farmers also will have to idle only 10 percent instead of 27.5 percent for 1988. _ The Disaster Assistance Act of 1988, which provides drought aid to stricken farmers, also permits <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to let farmers plant soybeans or sunflowers on corn acres without losing acreage credit for future program calculations Although 1989 soybean plantings are likely to expand less than either wheat or corn, production is expected to rise substantially. Soybean acreage in the South has been declining for several years as farmers returned land to fallow or other uses. Recovery could begin in 1989, but it will take sustained higher prices to boost the South's soybean acreage to levels of the late 1970s, when prices were high and exports boomed. `` Consumption of wheat, corn and soybeans is expected to increase in 1989-90,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` Domestic food, seed and industrial uses likely will be near present levels. However, global grain and oilseed use probably will increase slightly.'' Cole added: `` Export growth will be spurred further by increased demand from developing countries, as the value of the dollar remains relatively low. Price declines accompanying next year's harvest will make it easier for importing nations to maintain or expand purchases in 1989-90.

<HEAD>Could the Marbled Murrelet Be a Red Herring?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 If the marbled murrelet turns out to be an endangered bird, it may endanger loggers' plans to take timber from some of the oldest forests in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, in a little-noticed decision published in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to consider listing the marbled murrelet as an endangered species. The agency found that a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> petition for listing the bird `` presented substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted.'' Not much is known about the marbled murrelet, a robin-sized seabird that seems to swim better than it walks or flies. But scientists are convinced the bird nests almost exclusively in the old-growth timber that towers over the coastal regions of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> _ some of the oldest forests in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Listing the bird as endangered or threatened could result in a ban on cutting trees that are prized by the timber industry for their top-quality logs and premium market price. Timber industry officials accuse environmentalists of using the marbled murrelet to attempt a `` backdoor'' prohibition against old-growth timber harvesting on public lands. `` It sounds like a red herring,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> which includes among its members some of the largest forest-products companies in the Northwest. `` We need to decide what to do and get on with it,'' said <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>. `` But let's not play games and use soft little birds to defraud the process. These never-ending tactics aimed at foiling the process are irresponsible.'' Environmentalists do n't deny that they are waging a battle to halt the cutting of old-growth timber, but add that the marbled murrelet is worthy of protection in its own right. `` We are going to make the survival of the ancient forest a national issue,'' said <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> vice president. `` This is not just a problem for the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. Everyone owns these forests. It's like saying the Grand Canyon only belongs to the people of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.'' Caught in the middle is the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which recently declared that another bird that nests in old-growth timber, the spotted owl, was n't worthy of listing as endangered or threatened. That decision is now being reviewed in a lawsuit brought in federal court in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` What we have to answer is how important is old growth to the marbled murrelet,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottroff </PERSON>, a Fish and Wildlife biologist based in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> believes that the bird could eventually become extinct if logging of the old-growth forest continues. According to biologists' estimates, only 3,400 breeding pairs of marbled murrelets remain in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, maybe 2,400 breeding pairs in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and less than 1,000 in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Estimates for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> range up to 50,000 breeding pairs and the bird is also found in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pissot </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> specialist, said that since the turn of the century people have been trying to discover where the marbled murrelet nests. `` Now we know or think we know: 150 feet up on the thick branches of old-growth trees,'' said <PERSON> Pissot </PERSON>. `` They are very dependent on old growth.'' Environmentalists believe that more than 160 species may be dependent for survival on old-growth forests. `` The spotted owl and the marbled murrelet are just the tip of the iceberg,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` They dramatize what is at stake.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that about 7.5 million acres of old growth remains in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> with more than 80 percent of it on national forest lands. Plans call for cutting about half of that total over the next 50 years and <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials have warned that unless it is cut the region's timber industry could collapse. Environmentalists say the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimates are grossly inflated and even include trees that were destroyed by the 1980 eruption of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helens </LOCATION>. They also say that the old growth is being cut at the rate of more than 170 acres a day _ the equivalent of roughly 129 football fields. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to survey the remaining old growth and to come up with a common definition for an ancient tree. A <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> task force earlier defined old-growth trees as being at least 200 years old and almost three feet in diameter. Environmentalists say that definition is too narrow and that officials also should take into account how many of the trees are in a given area and whether it has the characteristics of a mature forest.

<HEAD>Savings Seen in Fighting Farm Pests with Other Insects</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chemical pesticides used to kill crop-damaging bugs too often destroy the pests' natural predators as well, says a group promoting use of the insect world's `` good guys'' to protect food supplies. The <ORGANIZATION> Consultative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, which holds its annual meeting here next week, has compiled a number of examples from around the world to bolster its position. It says, for instance, that the island republic of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> alone could save up to $ 100 million a year by cutting down on chemical pesticides and using other bugs to fight the ones that hurt the rice crop. The group represents 13 international research centers around the world, including those responsible for starting the `` green revolution'' in maize and other crops. They are trying to obtain $ 23.8 million for a five-year biological fight against pests. Damage by pests to cassava, on which 200 million Africans depend, has been estimated at $ 2 billion a year. Americans know cassava best as tapioca, and use it occasionally in puddings. In <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and other Third World areas it is a staple food. One economist calculated that a little wasp brought from <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> saved over $ 400 million worth of cassava in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> last year by eating large quantities of mealybugs, the chief culprit in the losses. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norgaard </PERSON>, who teaches farm economics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, wrote that the wasp program saved farmers $ 149 for every dollar spent on it. <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> used to be the top man on insects of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Banos </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. He now teaches about useful and harmful insects at <ORGANIZATION> Clemson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Clemson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` There are about 800 species of ` good guys' in the field,'' he said. `` In most cases they outnumber the ` bad guys' five to three.'' A major enemy of the rice plant is the brown planthopper. One wolf spider will kill 20 to 30 of them in a day, saving an estimated $ 3 worth of rice a season. The trick is to find the best bugs, test them, release them and get them established where they can do most good. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> told reporters that chemical pesticides can hurt farming as well as help, by killing the useful as well as the harmful insects. A study on <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> earlier this year by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said: `` Only when these predators were killed by unnecessary insecticide treatments did the brown planthopper escape natural control and become a serious pest.'' <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> said some pesticides must be used, but that they can be eliminated 70 percent to 90 percent of the time. The use of biological methods goes back to the ancient Chinese, who set predatory ants against some insects that attacked citrus fruit. The most recent list of such attempts, compiled in 1976, reports 327 successes. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Herren </PERSON> is a Swiss who works in the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Ibadan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. He said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures show that 40,000 Third World farmers are killed and 150,000 are injured every year from the use of pesticides. A study last year by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> reported several hundred deaths from pesticides a year in this country during the 1970s. It estimated that tens of thousands of people fell ill because of the chemicals. The international research group says the use of bugs, birds and microbes as well as chemicals to help fight pests can be cheaper, healthier and more effective than only spraying with pesticides. But it is also a lot more trouble, which may be one reason it has not caught on more in richer countries. `` Farmers do n't like counting bugs,'' <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> said.

 The oldest and largest trade group of savings institutions opened its annual convention today, intent on persuading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to help the ailing industry with a multibillion-dollar bailout and preserve it as a system separate from commercial banks. The nation's 3,048 savings institutions lost $ 7.5 billion in the first six months of this year and losses almost surely will top last year's post-Depression record of $ 7.8 billion. An estimated 4,050 delegates and spouses to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>' 96th annual convention have gathered in the palm-ringed luxury hotels along <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to map strategy for 1989, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> likely will make decisions affecting the industry for years to come. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the industry, estimates the cost of restoring all S & amp; Ls to solvency at $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion, but private analysts put the price tag as high as $ 100 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, scheduled to address the convention on Thursday, said his agency will have enough money to do the job, but only if thrift institutions are charged a special assessment for deposit insurance for the next 30 years. S & amp; Ls say they ca n't afford it and are looking to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to come up with the additional money. `` It's a 30-year mortgage we just flat out ca n't handle,'' said <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and outgoing chairman of the industry group. The bank board this year has shut down more than 135 institutions or merged them with stronger partners, but at midyear, 497 insolvent institutions were still open. Another 408 were solvent but losing money. The Federal Savings and <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, financed by assessments on the industry, was set up to insure deposits in S & amp; Ls but it has been weakened by the flurry of failures. S & amp; Ls already pay more than twice as much for deposit insurance as commercial banks _ $ 2.08 cents per $ 1,000 of deposits for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls compared with 83 cents for banks. <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> contends that continuing the extra assessment, originally scheduled to be phased out in three years, would push otherwise profitable institutions into insolvency, creating an ever-enlarging problem. So far this year, the extra assessment has made the difference between profit and loss for 69 institutions, he said. `` Clearly there is a limit to what the solvent institutions can do,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, when it decides how to pay the bill, whether through a direct appropriation from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> or through some sort of taxpayer-backed guarantee, will almost certainly include measures aimed at preventing the problem from recurring. Although much of the industry's problems are concentrated in depressed oil-producing states in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, they have been magnified in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by lax state regulation that permitted thrift institutions to make risky investments far removed from traditional home mortgage lending. Many in the industry had pushed for permission to diversify in the early 1980s when soaring interest rates made it impossible for thrifts to make money on their old, fixed-rate mortgages. The argument was that a greater range of activities would help institutions pull themselves out of the hole. As it turned out, <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> said, the institutions that strayed most from traditional mortgage lending earned the least. `` The ones that have gotten into trouble were the ones who took the most advantage of the new powers,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleczka </PERSON>, D-Wis., and other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say that after all the insolvent S & amp; Ls are closed or merged with stronger partners, the entire S & amp; L system should be merged with the commercial bank system But <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> says <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> home buyers need a separate S & amp; L system. A study by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> League this summer showed that thrifts and mortgage banking companies owned by thrifts provided 54 percent of the country's residential mortgages last year. `` I believe <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is beginning to recognize that we have n't abandoned our traditional role,'' <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> said `` If we do n't do it, you're going to have to reinvent the system. He said the league will be recommending regulatory changes in what he called a `` never again scenario.'' Among the likely recommendations, he said, would be stricter limits on direct investment in commercial real estate projects and on the amount that can be loaned to a single customer.

 A tractor-trailer driver ran at least nine vehicles off the road Sunday, killing one driver, and wounded an officer in a violence spree that stretched 70 miles, police said. A 30-year-old man was arrested, but no charges had been filed as of late Sunday, authorities said. The series of events on Interstate 10 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> lasted less than an hour, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, a Department of Public Safety spokesman. They began near <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>, about 100 miles southeast of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, when authorities received reports of cars being run off the road by a westbound semi-tractor-trailer, said <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> trooper <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. Thirty miles west of <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>, the man rammed a car driven by <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Agutter </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. She later was found dead in her flipped car on the side of the interstate, said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. Several miles west, a man driving a recreational vehicle pulling a trailer was rammed from behind and run off the road. The driver of the RV was uninjured and followed the trucker, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. A <LOCATION> Hudspeth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> constable and a <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agent who heard about the incident on their police radio pulled over and waited for the trucker. When he drove by, the two officers gave chase. The officers pulled the trucker over near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hancock </LOCATION>. When Constable <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillin </PERSON> got out of the patrol car, the driver tried to pin him against the vehicle, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hillin </PERSON> was able to scramble away, get back into the car and drive it in front of the truck to stop it. When <PERSON> Hillin </PERSON> got out of his car again, the truck driver shot two times through his own windshield and hit the officer once, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. He said the trucker then fired at the trailing recreational vehicle, but no one was injured. The truck driver then drove off a second time. The driver finally stopped his vehicle a half-mile west of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hancock </LOCATION>. He offered no resistance, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hillin </PERSON> was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, where he was in stable condition with a gunshot wound to the neck, a nursing supervisor said late Sunday.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is entering into a worldwide treaty providing reciprocal copyright protection for American artists and writers and those of 76 other countries. In a ceremony in a hotel meeting room today, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was signing legislation bringing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> copyright law into compliance with the 102-year-old Bern Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratified the treaty on Oct. 20, but legislation making changes in American copyright laws was also needed before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could become a full-fledged member of the convention. Differences between American and other nations' copyright laws stalled ratification for decades, but many of the obstacles were removed when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted a sweeping overhaul of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyright law in 1976. Participation in the convention will enable the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to have copyright relations with 24 countries with which it now has none, officials said. The convention was signed in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> on Sept. 9, 1886. It spells out minimum copyright standards, detailing what is protected and how long the copyright lasts. It also bars member nations from discriminating against protected works from other member states. The signing ceremony was the only public event on the president's schedule today. On Sunday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, traveled from their ranch north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> to receive awards from the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, an organization dedicated to the study of the Holocaust. In a speech accepting the center's 1988 humanitarian award, the president said his administration has made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` warmer than they have ever been'' and added: `` We must remain strong, and we must be willing to use force when we are under threat. This is a lesson that binds us still closer to the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>; for the fact is, a strong <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> depends upon a strong America.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also announced that he will soon sign enabling legislation passed this year to facilitate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adherence to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> convention on genocide, which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratified in 1986 after a long campaign by Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>. Aides said the president is expected to sign the legislation on Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> The award to the president was given for his efforts on behalf of peace and his support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It was presented at a dinner held on the 80th birthday of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON>, who has worked with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other governments in locating Nazi war criminals. <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON> joined the president and others at the head table. The president, who left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday, campaigned for the Republican ticket in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and made a foreign policy address here before spending the weekend at the ranch.

<TEXT>
 The damage has been repaired and the continuing aftershocks are mostly imperceptible, and some say the great temblor that shook central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and killed two children five years ago is being forgotten. `` It was a beautiful day until the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> started shaking,'' remembered <PERSON> Oval </PERSON> <PERSON> Caskey </PERSON>, mayor of the small town of <LOCATION> Mackay </LOCATION>. `` It just shook everything down to the roots.'' The quake struck near the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Challis </LOCATION> on the morning of Oct. 28, 1983. At 7.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, it was the nation's most powerful earthquake in nearly 20 years and one of the country's strongest ever recorded. The quake visibly rolled up the valley, undulating the ground like an ocean wave and making its shock felt as far away as southwestern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, or more than 600 miles. The state's tallest mountain, 12,662-foot <PERSON> Borah </PERSON> <PERSON> Peak </PERSON>, was at the epicenter. The quake lifted it a foot, dropped the valley to the west 4 feet and created a 12-mile-long fault line still visible today. Two school children died in the valley that's home to about 1,400 people. Damage in <LOCATION> Challis </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> ran into the millions of dollars. `` I was never worried about earthquakes before,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, owner of Round Valley Supply in <LOCATION> Challis </LOCATION>. `` But every time you feel a tremor your heart stops for a second and you wonder if this is another big one.'' Residents worked quickly to repair the damage, though, and the government built a city hall in <LOCATION> Mackay </LOCATION> and several new schools in the valley. `` They're a tough bunch,'' said <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weymouth </PERSON>, who recently moved from <LOCATION> Challis </LOCATION> to northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` They submerged their feelings and simply went on with their lives.'' <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> is one of them. Her 6-year-old son, <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, was killed by the falling rubble along with 7-year-old <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> Leaton </PERSON> as they walked to school in <LOCATION> Challis </LOCATION>. `` I'm a person who believes the past is in the past and it should be left there,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> said. `` Bringing it back up just opens a lot of old wounds.'' Aftershocks have dwindled to only a few each week, and only a fraction of them are felt beyond scientists' seismographs. Attitudes have lightened so much that when an aftershock has been big enough, like last summer's 4.7 tremor, clerks in the <ORGANIZATION> Custer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION> have set up a betting pool for estimating the final <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale reading. Scientists like <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> express worries that information gleaned from the quake has been ignored. `` We can take what we've learned there now and say what would happen if we had an equivalent earthquake in, say, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' which lies on the <LOCATION> Wasatch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION>. But, he cautioned: `` The people who are in the position to utilize this kind of data, the land-use planners, the legislative people ... seem to operate on short-term problems. The lessons learned from <LOCATION> Borah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peak </LOCATION> do n't seem to have made much of an impact yet.'' <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said the state has scheduled a major earthquake disaster exercise for next spring. But he acknowledged that building codes have n't been revised, and said a disaster of greater magnitude may be needed to prompt such changes. `` Had that event happened and affected seriously a major city, it would not have been so quickly forgotten,'' he said.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Case Could Set Precedent for Older Power Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Utilities nationwide are closely watching a clean-air case involving a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> power company because it could affect future renovation projects at hundreds of older plants across the country. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has told <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that it will have to meet more stringent standards for new plants if it goes ahead with planned repairs at a coal-fired power plant. The industry has long assumed that such renovation projects were exempt from the tougher clean-air rules that apply to new plants. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling is the first of its kind. `` I think they are flat wrong,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickel </PERSON>, chief lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which represents utilities. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision, he said, contradicts current regulations. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, environmental manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, trade association of the nation's private utilities, said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling could amount to `` a de facto acid rain program.'' The Energy Department has taken the utilities' side, protesting to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> that the decision could jeopardize future power supplies, or make them more costly. Utilities say they may simply close plants or forgo repairs if the new-plant standards will apply. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` is making the right call.'' `` It's about time they put some life and teeth into the requirements'' that significant renovation qualifies a plant as new. The plant involved is the <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> station in suburban <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, whose five 80-megawatt generating units were installed from 1935 to 1950. In 1984 the company discovered severe cracks in steam drums. The following year one of the five units was taken off line and steam pressure reduced in the other four, for an overall drop in capacity of 40 percent. Now the company plans to replace the steam drums in a project costing $ 71 million. <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> argues that this is routine maintenance that ought to be exempt from review. But in an Oct. 14 letter to the company informing it of the decision, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the company had told state regulators the project was not routine, that $ 46 million of the expense was a capital expenditure, that capacity had deteriorated before 1984 for other reasons, and that other equipment also would be replaced to help restore original capacity. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said emissions will go back up once the plant resumes full-power generation, and that the increase will result from a capital rather than a maintenance expenditure. The argument that the utility plans only to restore original capacity is not relevant under those circumstances, he said. Sulfur dioxide is the most important pollutant at issue. Formed from sulfur in the fuel, it is transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric acid, leading to acid rain. A new plant today would be limited to 0.6 to 1.2 pounds of sulfur per million BTUs provided by the fuel. At the same time it would have to remove 70 percent to 90 percent of the sulfur originally in the coal. Port <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> now burns coal emitting 2.5 pounds of sulfur per million BTUs. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s hourly emissions of sulfur dioxide would increase from current levels by 69 percent after the renovation. As a practical matter, the only way to prevent that increase would be to install smokestack `` scrubbers'' _ something that according to one industry rule of thumb could cost about $ 80 million at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, more than the repairs, and reduce the plant's electrical output by 5 percent. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Power </LOCATION> is negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in a bid to avoid that expense. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a company spokeswoman, declined to discuss specifics of the negotiations, though she did confirm that fuel-switching to oil or gas is an option. Though <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sulfur dioxide emissions have been falling since the mid-1970s, environmentalists say they would have fallen faster if more old plants had been replaced by new plants. Extending the life of old plants `` was n't even on the radar screen'' in 1979, when the current regulations were promulgated, said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, who was then with the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and helped draft the rules. Now, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, plants more than 30 years old are expected to account for 25 percent of all fossil-fueled generating capacity in 1990 and 90 percent in 2010.

 On the eve of a new round of peace talks, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> each released 25 prisoners of war and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he would promptly seek the repatriation of the thousands that remain. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> secretary general told reporters on arrival Sunday that he hoped the third round of talks that begins today would soon yield `` positive results,'' specifically on the exchange of prisoners. But he has said his first target as mediator to have both sides agree to the disengagement of forces that a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report says have remained in `` dangerous proximity'' since Aug. 20, when a truce halted the 8-year-old war. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which is monitoring the cease-fire, says in the report that in some places troops are separated by just 30 feet of no man's land. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he planned to discuss the prisoner-of-war issue this morning with the president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and expected to meet later today with the delegations of both sides. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report estimates <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> hold a combined total of up to 105,000 prisoners of war, though the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has registered just 50,182 in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and 19,284 in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. So far, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has freed 790 prisoners and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> 638, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. On Sunday, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> freed 25 disabled Iranian prisoners and they were flown to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, aboard a plane chartered by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reciprocated immediately by releasing 25 Iraqi prisoners who boarded the same plane for the return flight to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Francoise </PERSON> <PERSON> Derand </PERSON>, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has agreed in principle to release all prisoners and says their freedom should not have to be worked out in the peace talks. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said the exchange must be based on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution under which the cease-fire took hold and on a plan drafted by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. That plan provides for a timetable for implementing all ten points of the cease-fire resolution, ranging from the prisoner-of-war exchange to assessment of damages and an inquiry into who started the war. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Sunday night that he hoped the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks would be `` if possible much more useful'' than the previous round held in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> early this month. Both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have not budged on the principal issue stalemating the talks since they began in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Aug. 25: delineation of the border between the two nations. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says a 1975 treaty set the border in the middle of the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only navigable outlet to the sea. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> repudiated the treaty in 1980 and demands sovereignty over the entire waterway. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, who heads his country's delegation to the talks, told reporters at the airport on Sunday that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` did not go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for substantial negotiations `` Let us resume direct talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> where we can stay for a while as long as the job needs,'' he said. `` Now we will negotiate on this matter with the Iranians.'' He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, whose delegation is headed by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, is to blame that `` we are still on the same place -LRB- in the peace talks -RRB- where we left in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Thai Military Officers Said To Steal U.S. Covert Aid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A covert <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> program to aid non-communist rebels in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is operating at reduced levels following discovery that military officers in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> had siphoned off some $ 3.5 million, according to intelligence sources and a published report. The corruption scandal, which may also have involved some Thai businessmen, was reported in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and confirmed in part by other sources, who declined to be identified by name. The program, one of several <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration initiatives to bolster anti-communist forces in conflicts around the world, has since been cleaned up but is operating at reduced levels. More rigorous accounting procedures are in place, the newspaper reported. It said <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officers in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> first turned up evidence that money had been skimmed from the covert aid program, which totaled $ 12 million in fiscal 1988. Some of the Cambodian rebels operate from neighboring <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The agency then tipped off the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which sent a four-member audit team to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The team, part of a beefed-up independent auditing capability instituted by committee chairman Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., and co-chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, confirmed the existence of the scheme The team's report back to the intelligence panel on July 12 sparked disagreement over whether the covert support should be continued, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported, citing a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> document detailing the developments. At the time, the administration was seeking to increase support to resistance forces opposing Vietnamese troops inside <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The program's aim is to establish a non-communist presence that could prevent the return of the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> when the Vietnamese pull troops out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. After a debate within the intelligence panel it was decided to continue the program, but to reduce the amount of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support to $ 8 million in the current year and to institute strict procedures for making sure the money is spent for its intended purposes _ non-lethal items and training. The audit team later returned to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to review how new controls were working, and found `` solid evidence'' that proper accounting was in place, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. The covert program in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, begun in 1982 or 1983, had until then provoked little controversy and had received far less public exposure than similar administration programs to support anti-communist rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> declined to comment directly on the Post story, but issued a statement saying he was `` deeply troubled'' by the reference to a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> document provided by an executive branch source. `` I have asked both the secretary of state and the director of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to determine if anyone in the executive branch has indeed been compromising classified documents,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said.

 A terminally ill woman who set up and attended her own funeral says she'll remember it for the rest of her life _ and after. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Munson </PERSON>, who overcame a quarter-century addiction to heroin to earn a college degree at age 49, attended her funeral Saturday at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, wearing the cap and gown she wore when she got her diploma. The 62-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> woman, who suffers from pancreatic cancer, said she planned her own funeral because she wanted to see the faces of `` friends, associates and enemies.'' More than 100 people attended. `` You ca n't communicate with your friends and tell them how you feel inside a box,'' <PERSON> Munson </PERSON> said as she peered around the church. `` As I look around, I do n't see any enemies. All I see is friends. `` This is a moment in my life that I will never forget and after I'm gone I'll remember it, too.'' <PERSON> Munson </PERSON> said the funeral will provide the perfect ending to her autobiography: `` Bury Me in My Cap and Gown.'' In his eulogy, the Rev. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lathan </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Munson </PERSON>'s faith in God and determination. `` You have stood up with faith. You have challenged even the medical society,'' <PERSON> Lathan </PERSON> said. `` Carrie, there is no guarantee you wo n't be able to wear that cap and gown again,'' he said. `` Many of us here with you may beat you to the grave.'' For <PERSON> Munson </PERSON>, the cap and gown are something to be proud of. Until she was in her 40s, <PERSON> Munson </PERSON> had only a fourth-grade education. After 25 years of drug addiction and small-time crime and several suicide attempts, she decided to do something with her life. <PERSON> Munson </PERSON> said she prayed, began to hate the drugs and set out to prove herself by attending college. `` I knew I was n't stupid. I knew I was n't dumb,'' she said. `` If I take what I learned on the street and put it into this B.A. ... I'll have a masterpiece.'' <PERSON> Munson </PERSON> graduated in 1975 from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> with a degree in journalism and mass communications. Since then, she has worked as a radio jazz show host and as a social worker. <PERSON> Ziff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sistrunk </PERSON> said he took a bus from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to attend the ceremony after reading about <PERSON> Munson </PERSON>'s plans in the newspaper. During the funeral, he sang the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> hit `` I Did It My Way,'' saying he had read that <PERSON> Munson </PERSON> cherished the song. <PERSON> Munson </PERSON> said she had a message for drug addicts and cancer patients: `` Why be afraid? We've all got to die. Live every day to the fullest. Do n't sit around and worry about death.''

 As <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> walked through a crowded town market on a hand-shaking campaign tour, a loyalist of the rival <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc confronted him with an angry question. `` I worked at Alliance Tire for 20 years, and now I've lost my job,'' the man screamed. `` What are you going to do about it?'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, upset by hecklers drowning out his speech, shouted back that the man should apply for unemployment. The acrimonious scene was a reminder that, though the Palestinian uprising has been the focus of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s election campaign, economic problems will be a major task facing whoever is in office after Tuesday's elections. Economists are warning of a possible recession, a growing crisis facing <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> industry and a sharp rise in unemployment. Several large unions threatened strikes even as election day approached. About 15,000 employees at three major <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> banks held a one-day strike Sunday. Leaders of the Histadrut, the nation's trade union federation allied to the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, convinced most of them to return to work today. The workers, some of whom earn as little as $ 600 a month, are demanding higher pay. Also, gasoline truckers demanding a 4.5 percent wage increase nearly walked off the job, but the strike was averted when Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> agreed to discuss the truckers' demands at Sunday's Cabinet meeting. Last week <ORGANIZATION> Koor </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest industrial conglomerate employing 27,000 people, had to be bailed out by the government after it defaulted on a $ 20 million loan. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who heads the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, immediately turned that into a rallying cry for an end to Labor-backed policies that traditionally have preserved jobs regardless of the cost. `` The concept of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> belongs to the past, it belongs to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the beginning of the century,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in a speech calling for `` a free economy and free enterprise.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, though he has a say in the coalition government along with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, responded by blaming <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> for tight money policies and high interest rates that have hampered industrial growth and moved the economy precariously close to recession. `` Today there are 3,000 plants in distress,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> charged in a televised debate with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. `` What plant can pay 30 percent to 35 percent interest? This entire policy rocks the economy.'' How voters will respond to the rhetoric remains unclear. <PERSON> Hanoch </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an independent pollster, says surveys so far have shown `` a standoff between the two main parties'' on economic issues. Labor appears more vulnerable than <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> because the <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION> owns or controls many of the ailing industries, chief among them <ORGANIZATION> Koor </ORGANIZATION> and the nation's largest insurance company. A few months ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION>'s ailing <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> northeast of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> was put in the hands of a state-appointed receiver, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> banks put up $ 8 million in emergency loans to keep the company afloat. After a three-month closure, the plant was reopened Oct. 5 but 250 workers _ including the one who confronted <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> _ were not recalled. Economists say Israeli's current industrial problems stem in part from its success in dealing with another economic evil faced when the coalition came to power in 1984 _ inflation. That year, consumer prices were rising a record 445 percent a year. In July 1985, the government enacted an `` emergency stabilization program'' with wage and price freezes, stringent monetary controls and tight budget policies that have brought inflation down to about 16 percent a year. Although the government has eased up since to allow limited wage and price increases, continuing high interest rates and strict exchange rate controls have squeezed business profits. In addition, the Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> has sapped millions of dollars from the tourist industry and from businesses that traditionally depend on Arab workers, such as construction and textiles. One western-trained economist, who insisted on anonymity, predicted the Israeli economy would grow 1 percent or less this year, well below the government's target of 3.7 percent and down sharply from last year's 5.2 percent growth. The nation's unemployment rate has risen from 5.6 percent at the end of 1987 to nearly 6 percent in the first half of 1988, and some economists believe it hit 7 percent in the July-September quarter.

 Some people flocked to the countryside to see if Martians had landed, while others fled in fear after a local radio station broadcast a 50th-anniversary rendition of <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>' `` War of the Worlds.'' The 90-minute broadcast on Sunday had been advertised in preceding days but nevertheless sparked scores of calls to police and fire services in <LOCATION> Braga </LOCATION>, a northern city of 63,000 people. The curious drove to an area outside town where <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Braga </ORGANIZATION> reported aliens from Mars were landing, officials said. The frightened began fleeing in cars, according to news reports from the area. Lines reportedly formed at some gas stations in <LOCATION> Braga </LOCATION>, 200 miles north of the capital, <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. The broadcast was a recreation of Welles' radio dramatization of the H.G. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> novel `` The War of the Worlds.'' On Oct. 30, 1938, the actor and director interrupted radio broadcasts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with a report that Martians had landed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. That broadcast caused hundreds of thousands of people to panic. In <LOCATION> Braga </LOCATION>, police were called to control 150 to 200 demonstrators who gathered outside the studios of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Braga </ORGANIZATION> to protest the broadcast of the recreation of Welles' version, said <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON>, a reporter at the station. <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON> said the station received more than 100 calls. `` Some called to complain, some to inquire and some to offer congratulations,'' he said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON> said the broadcast was intended as an homage to <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION> and had been well publicized previously in newspapers and on the radio station itself. He said the program itself also contained clues that it was fiction. A police spokesman in <PERSON> Braga </PERSON>, who asked not to be named, confirmed police had been called to the radio station. He said many people believed the broadcast initially, but added that no serious incidents were reported.

 <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> exchanged his bartender's apron for the mayor's mantle four years ago and, barring a long-shot victory by one of the three police chiefs to leave his administration, will remain a mixologist of policy, not drinks. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Still </PERSON>, who resigned as police chief after <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> took office, advanced to the Nov. 8 runoff election after winning 33.6 percent of the primary vote. Eleven candidates fragmented the vote, and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> fell just short of topping the 50 percent plus one vote need to avert a runoff. A poll by KATU-TV Oct. 13 showed <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> leading Still, 58 percent to 32 percent, with 10 percent undecided. The margin of error was plus or minus 5 points. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, owner of the popular <ORGANIZATION> Goose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hollow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tavern </ORGANIZATION>, points to such accomplishments during his first term as voter approval of a bond measure for a convention center and formulation of a plan to deal with the city's homeless. Still has made veiled criticisms of <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s eccentricities, which include a victory cry of `` Whoop! Whoop!'' once performed on `` The Tonight Show starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'' and a penchant for wearing shorts and suspenders. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> once posed for a poster that carried the caption `` Expose Yourself to Art'' and showed a back view of a man opening an overcoat in front of a statue. `` <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> needs a mayor who knows when to wear lederhosen and when to wear a three-piece suit,'' Still said early in the campaign. `` A lot of people say they want their mayor to look and act like someone who can run a multimillion-dollar corporation,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaudry </PERSON>, Still's campaign manager. For his part, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said he is one of many mayors `` who have used certain antics in drawing attention to their city.'' Still also has criticized <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> for his handling of the police. Still's resignation led to <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> as the nation's first female chief of a big-city police department.

 The sheriff's secretary spent a night behind bars in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, as did the manager of the farm bureau and some of the sheriff's friends. They were guilty of no known wrongdoing. They spent Friday night in jail for laughs and worthy causes. `` It just seemed like something different to do,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jett </PERSON>, county farm bureau manager. `` You do n't get the opportunity to do this very often _ come in here and be able to leave.'' Twenty-five people spent the night in jail as part of a program called `` Slumber in the Slammer.'' That's what Sheriff <PERSON> Mearl </PERSON> <PERSON> Justus </PERSON> called an all-night party to break in a $ 2.7 million jail addition dedicated earlier in the day. Participants gave donations for the privilege of going to jail, with money going to the Women's Crisis Center and for a memorial being built near the jail to honor officers killed in the line of duty. `` I think it was successful,'' <PERSON> Justus </PERSON> said. `` We ought to net a couple thousand dollars for each cause.''

 The dollar fell against the Japanese yen Monday, while share prices inched up on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues finished trading at 27,982.54, adding 21.53 points, or 0.08 percent. The index closed at 27,961.01 Saturday. The dollar closed at 125.00, down 1.08 yen from Friday's close of 126.08 yen. Opening at 125.72 yen, the currency moved in a range of 124.98-125 .85 yen Exchange dealers attributed the weaker dollar to a decline in the currency on overseas markets. They said there was a general perception that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy was beginning to show signs of slowing down and that was driving the dollar down. They added, however, market participants were concerned over intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> to prop up the dollar and prevent its further fall against the yen. `` The market's sentiment appears to be inclined toward a weaker dollar,'' said <PERSON> Yoshikazu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotouge </PERSON>, dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Yasuda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` But there was some buying of the dollar at around the 125.70-yen level, and that's keeping the dollar from falling rapidly.'' Dealers said that despite intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> on a small scale several times Monday morning, the central bank was not able to stop the dollar's decline. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> was lower in early morning trading due to profit-taking, but dealers said the market was still bullish after gains last week. `` Investors took advantage of last week's gain and as a result, share prices opened lower,'' said a broker at a major Japanese securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` But the general sentiment of the market is still bullish.

<HEAD>20 Years Later, Hollywood Has Mixed Reviews For Film Rating System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The film ratings system, which at its inception gave a G to `` Dracula Has Risen From the Grave,'' turns 20 years old Tuesday to mixed reviews from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> insiders and outsiders. To groups denouncing what they see as a penchant by the film industry for sex, violence and drugs, the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>'s ratings system is inadequate. To many filmmakers, an X rating, or even a family-oriented G, means box-office poison, and obtaining a PG-13 or an R has become imperative, the equivalent of a mass-marketing seal of approval. To <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Siskel </PERSON>, film critic for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, `` The R-rated category is now so widespread, and covers so many emotions and physical acts that I do n't know how valuable it is to parents.'' But to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON>, who has overseen the rating system for two decades as the association's president and chief executive officer, the film code has achieved at least one feat. `` I think just the act of surviving is itself a minor triumph,'' <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> said in a recent interview. The ratings, however, have gotten less than rave reviews from <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Radecki </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a system designed to placate the public,'' <PERSON> Radecki </PERSON> said, `` and to prevent a public rating system from coming into existence.'' <PERSON> Radecki </PERSON> conceded that the code is better than none, but argued the ratings are `` why we have so much more violent and sexually degrading films than we did when the rating system was started.'' <PERSON> Radecki </PERSON> would prefer a ratings system with specific guidelines, something like the 1934 code that prohibited `` passion that stimulates the baser emotions'' and `` lustful kissing.'' He contends that rating guidelines should forbid the use of alcohol or drugs in PG-rated movies. But <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON>, who dismisses <PERSON> Radecki </PERSON>'s group as `` right-wing zealots,'' said he's rejected pleas to designate a variety of things depicted in films as taboo, including sex, violence, drug use, smoking and even animal cruelty. `` Pretty soon we would put such baggage on this rating system it would collapse,'' <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> said. The principal guideline given board members, <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> said, is: `` If you had to meet with the parents of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, tomorrow, do you believe they would find what you want to rate this picture to be fair and reasonable?'' <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> also disputed arguments the ratings have somehow encouraged Hollywood sex and violence. He said the ratings are a mirror of society's values and that the association surveys moviegoers' attitudes toward the code each year to measure its success. `` Over the last decade, 65 percent to 73 -LRB- percent -RRB- of all parents with children under 13 say it's ` very useful to fairly useful' in helping them'' determine which movies their children see, <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> said, `` and 20 to 23 percent find it not useful at all.'' `` Now by political standards that's a landslide,'' he added. The board's nine members `` are neither gods nor fools,'' <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> said. `` They're just people who like movies, and they're parents and they're intelligent.'' <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> hires the board's chairman, and together they select the eight other members. The board's costs are underwritten by a fee each filmmaker must pay in submitting the movie to be rated. Appeals are possible only to a 22-member board comprising theater owners, independent producers and distributors and major producers and distributors. The first film rated by the board was `` Dracula Has Risen From the Grave,'' which got a G rating, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, an association spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. Soon, `` Midnight Cowboy,'' which starred <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Voight </PERSON>, was given an X but still managed to win the Oscar for Best Picture of 1969. Altogether, the association has rated 8,460 films, <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> said. He said no more than 100 of them have created any controversy, citing disputes over ratings assigned such films as `` Angel Heart,'' `` Cruising'' and 1983's `` Scarface.'' Of the total, Ms. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said, 11.1 percent were G-rated; 33.4 percent were PG; 3.4 percent were PG-13 -LRB- a category instituted in 1984 -RRB-; 47.8 percent were R-rated and 4.3 percent were X-rated. Ms. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> noted that pornographic filmmakers do not submit their films for screening, and eagerly apply multiple Xs to their films themselves.

<HEAD>Eighty Five Detained In Thursday Roundup, Charter Spokesmen Held</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least 85 people were detained in a massive police roundup of dissidents that coincided with the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s independence, a dissident source said. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabatova </PERSON>, a signatory of the Charter 77 human rights document, said Sunday that most were rounded up on Thursday and that all three of the movement's spokesmen were among those detained. One spokesman, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON>, apparently was detained after going to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on Friday to attend a banned independent rally marking the anniversary, <PERSON> Sabatova </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> did not return home after the rally, which was broken up by riot police using water cannon and tear gas. Another spokesman, <PERSON> Bohumir </PERSON> <PERSON> Janat </PERSON>, was detained with his girlfriend on and another man in <LOCATION> Lany </LOCATION>, 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, as they went Saturday to lay flowers on the grave of <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrigue </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sabatova </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON> was the first president of democratic <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, although Communist authorities give him scant attention. <PERSON> Sabatova </PERSON> said other people in the group <PERSON> Janat </PERSON> was with made it to the <LOCATION> Lany </LOCATION> cemetery to lay a bouquet from Charter 77 on <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>'s grave Wreaths from the presidency, the national parliament and the Communist-led National Front were laid on the grave in a low-key, 10-minute ceremony on Thursday. <PERSON> Sabatova </PERSON>, who is also a leading activist of <ORGANIZATION> VONS </ORGANIZATION>, the Committee for the Unjustly Prosecuted, said at least 85 people were detained in a massive roundup of dissidents on Thursday. Those held included the third Charter 77 spokesman, <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON>. Only one person detained, <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hradilek </PERSON>, had been reported freed. He was released on Saturday, but detained again after he laid a wreath on a spot in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> where there used to be a statue of <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sabatova </PERSON> said. Customarily, police hold dissidents in such roundups for 48 hours and then release them without charges. At least one man, Charter 77 signatory <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Benda </PERSON>, was released Saturday and rearrested immediately, his wife said.

<TEXT>
 Voters re-elected a mayor who ran on his longstanding and strident opposition to having <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military housing built in a forested oasis that is a sanctuary to birds and other wildlife. But despite the return to office Sunday of Mayor <PERSON> Kichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomino </PERSON>, the national government appears determined to go ahead with the housing project in this city 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The housing would relieve crowding at the nearby <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, home port of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Seventh Fleet. `` This is a clear indication of the wishes of the residents of <LOCATION> Zushi </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Tomino </PERSON> said in a victory speech. He said he hoped the government would take heed of the residents' wishes and reconsider the project. In the hotly contested election, <PERSON> Tomino </PERSON> defeated physician <PERSON> Tadashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ina </PERSON>, a proponent of the construction plan, by just over 3,000 votes. Backing <PERSON> Ina </PERSON> was the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has governed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for most of the postwar period. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told reporters today that he expected <PERSON> Tomino </PERSON>'s victory and `` the construction will progress,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military has tried to keep a low profile over the drawn-out housing controversy, saying it was a matter for the Japanese to work out. Voter turnout was reportly high after the polls opened Sunday, and when the ballots were counted this morning <PERSON> Tomino </PERSON> had 17,507 votes to <ORGANIZATION> Ina </ORGANIZATION>'s 14,489. At stake in the election was about a quarter of the <LOCATION> Ikego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, more than 700 acres of forest in the center of <LOCATION> Zushi </LOCATION>, a town of 58,000 in <LOCATION> Kanagawa </LOCATION> prefecture. The forest has gone almost untouched for half a century and is a sanctuary for birds and other wildlife in an otherwise densely populated area. Environmentalists and local housewives drew national attention with their campaign to defy the plan the central government announced six years ago to build more than 900 apartment units in <LOCATION> Ikego </LOCATION>. The location was picked because it is the former site of a Japanese imperial navy ammunition dump. In recent weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has begun clearing trees at the fringes of the hills. Under a bilateral security treaty, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must supply land and help pay the cost of maintaining the 48,000 American military personnel stationed nationwide. Due in part to the weak dollar, private off-base housing is expensive for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel. In an unsuccessful compromise proposed by <LOCATION> Kanagawa </LOCATION> Governor <PERSON> Kazuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagasu </PERSON> last year, the number of units was reduced to 854 on 205 acres of land. <PERSON> Tomino </PERSON>, first elected in 1984, rejected the compromise and resigned last year to force a new election and demonstrate local opposition to the construction. He also was re-elected in that election. Sunday's election was held because <PERSON> Tomino </PERSON>'s original four-year term had expired. During this year's campaign, <PERSON> Ina </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Tomino </PERSON>'s opposition to the plan had been ineffective and that it was time for <LOCATION> Zushi </LOCATION> residents to look to the future and put the <LOCATION> Ikego </LOCATION> issue behind them. In February, <PERSON> Tomino </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to plead his case but was turned back by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen who said they were too busy to hear him out.

 A refinery tank exploded, killing two workers and critically injuring two others after covering the four with molten asphalt that burned through layers of clothing and hardened on their bodies, officials said. Sunday's fire and the resulting explosion in the tank, which was several stories high, were contained within 30 minutes by refinery firefighters, said <PERSON> Elise </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The explosion, the second this month at the refinery off <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, `` sounded like a vacuum-packed puff,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowal </PERSON> of <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON>, who was driving by the refinery just northwest of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>. `` Next thing I know there was black smoke 100 to 200 feet in the air. It just pushed it up like a mushroom cloud.'' The cause of the fire was under investigation, said <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusbel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zivich </PERSON> had hardened asphalt up to half an inch thick on parts of their bodies when they were brought to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catherine </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said emergency room Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>. `` We had to cut all their clothes off with a cast saw,'' Pepper said. `` Most of them had two or three layers of clothes on because of the cold weather, so it burned right through their clothes.'' <PERSON> Kusbel </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Whiting </LOCATION>, died six hours after suffering third-degree burns over more than 80 percent of his body, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>, 44, was pronounced dead on the scene, officials said. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Zivich </PERSON>, 44, of <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>, were in critical condition at hospitals today with third-degree burns over much of their bodies, officials said. The refinery in this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb along the <LOCATION> Illinois-Indiana </LOCATION> state line was once the largest in the nation and has been the scene of several major fires in the past 10 years. Two men were hurt in a fire and explosion in a different part of the plant Oct. 6. In April, 16 people were injured in an explosion and small fire in a processing unit. A December 1984 fire destroyed two bulk storage tanks and forced the evacuation of about 100 people. In 1979, a series of explosions and the ensuing fire forced the evacuation of about 1,500 residents. A 1955 explosion at the refinery killed two people, injured 35 others and destroyed 70 storage tanks and 200 homes. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said the refinery's safety record is good. `` The asphalt unit, up to about the first of October, had gone 350-some days without a disabling injury. It had the best safety record of any unit in the refinery,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said.

 An army officer who says winning the loyalty of the poor is necessary to win the country's civil war has been named head of the military Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, a brigade commander, takes command of the military forces on Tuesday, replacing Gen. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, who is going to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> as military attache. <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, head of the joint chiefs of staff since 1983, announced the change of command within the U.S.-backed government in a local television interview broadcast late Saturday. The 48-year-old general, who had been expected to step down by year's end, said his transfer `` is not related to the political situation. It is necessary to open spaces for new generations.'' <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION>, 41, was singled out as an exceptional commander by four <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonels earlier this year in a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> fellowship analysis of the Salvadoran civil war. `` We can not think that solely by military means we are going to resolve this war,'' <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said this year. `` Even if we kill all the subversives, the problem will not end. Such deplorable socio-economic conditions would remain that it -LRB- insurgency -RRB- could easily revive.'' Rebel and government negotiators have met three times, most recently in October 1987, in an unsuccessful bid to negotiate a cease-fire in the 8-year-old civil war.

 The lone operating reactor at Three Mile Island made an unscheduled shutdown for reasons believed to have originated in the plant's non-nuclear turbine system, a spokesman said. The Unit 1 reactor shut down automatically at 8:50 a.m. Sunday, said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomb </PERSON>, a spokesman for plant operator <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Plant systems operated normally during the shutdown and no emergency condition existed, he said The federal <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was notified, <PERSON> Tomb </PERSON> said. Plant and agency officials checked the system to try to determine the cause of the shutdown, which occurred as the reactor was operating at full power, he said. Three Mile Island was the site of the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident when equipment failures and human error led to a loss of coolant and partial core meltdown in the plant's Unit 2 reactor on March 28, 1979. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> approved the restart of the undamaged Unit 1 reactor in May 1985.

<HEAD>American Woman Priest Holds Unauthorized Communion in London
Despite Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman priest celebrated Communion with an Anglican feminist group outside a chapel where their services were banned after receiving widespread publicity. `` God is here,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Fageol </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said during the hourlong service Sunday night outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION>. `` Her spirit is with us,'' was the united response from nearly 100 mainly women supporters. Ms. <PERSON> Fageol </PERSON>, 38, was ordained in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is one several provinces of the worldwide Anglican Communion to ordain women. The Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synod </ORGANIZATION> has decided to move toward ordination of women, but there is much opposition at all levels. Ms. <PERSON> Fageol </PERSON> had been celebrating Communion in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> at the request of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilda </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> group since spring of 1978. But her service on Oct. 23, widely reported and photographed, led lawyers for the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION> and Fund, which administers property for the Bishop of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, to warn the group it would consider unauthorized services in the chapel as trespassing. Bishop of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, a leading opponent of efforts to allow women priests in the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, told Ms. <PERSON> Fageol </PERSON> in a letter Thursday: `` I greatly deplore the use of the sacrament for the purposes of protest and for promoting a cause.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said neither he nor Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, the Anglicans' spiritual leader, had authority `` to permit you as an Anglican and a woman priest ordained abroad'' to act as a priest in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where the church does not allow the ordination of women priests. But on Sunday night the group set up a folding table outside to hold the Communion wine, wholemeal bread rolls and candles, and proceeded with the Eucharist. After the service, Ms. <PERSON> Fageol </PERSON> said: `` I do n't feel I am defying the church. I do n't feel I am doing anything wrong. `` It is n't a deliberate act of defiance against the church, it's a deliberate giving of faith and witness and pastoral responsibility to a group of people who are trying to worship in a way they find useful spiritually,'' she said Ms Fageol is attached to a parish church in <LOCATION> Leeds </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, while studying for a doctorate. She said she intended to continue holding Communion for the St. <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON>'s group as soon as they could find a new home. The archbishop of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Habgood </PERSON>, said in a service at York Minster on Saturday that the cause of women's ordination, which he supports, could be endangered by these unauthorized services.

 Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers on Monday released a videotaped message from one of their two American captives, journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a few days after he turned 41. The tape was delivered to a Western news agency office in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> along with a statement in Arabic. `` My name is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>,'' the captive began his message in English. `` Once again I have been given the chance to speak to my government, my family and my people. `` I love you, I miss you very much. I know of your continued strong efforts for me ... the work and devotion of my friends and colleagues, and many people I do n't know. I know I can not repay you,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was kidnapped March 16, 1985, in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and is the longest-held of the 14 foreigners still missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and presumed captives of kidnappers. Nine of the 14 are Americans. He was seized by a group calling itself Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, and marked a fourth birthday in captivity on Thursday. Islamic Jihad's statement that accompanied the videotape said: `` To the families of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages ... to the family of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` On the occasion of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s birthday and in response to your letters, and according to his desire to send you a recorded message, we hereby enclose with this statement the recorded message on videotape,'' it said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> appeared relaxed as he read from a prepared statement. He was cleanshaven and wore his eyeglasses. His hair was neatly combed. He appeared from the waist up, wearing a striped gray sweater. `` I am well and being well treated and I received your birthday greetings and as always I thank you very much,'' he said. Letters from family members and colleagues appeared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers last week. `` As my fourth birthday in captivity passes and the end of my fourth year in captivity approaches, I find it difficult to keep my hope and courage high,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. The last previous videotape message from <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was released on Dec. 24. In it, appearing to read from a prepared text, the journalist criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for failing to secure his and fellow prisoners' freedom and warned `` There's a limit to how long we can last.'' Islamic Jihad also holds <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, an American who is acting dean of agriculture at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped on June 10, 1985.

 A Key West-style celebration of Halloween attracted cave dwellers, Romans and Greeks and some people who apparently interpreted the festival theme of `` B.C.'' as meaning `` Before Clothes.'' The island town's historic district was jammed with costumed-revelers for the Nighttime Fantasy Parade that stretched well into the wee hours of Sunday, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalton </PERSON>, director of the 10th annual Fantasy Fest. The parade, whose theme was `` Fantasy B.C.,'' brought out <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Flintstone </PERSON> and all their friends to mix and mingle with ancient Greeks and Egyptians and some bizarre space creatures, along with a few who caught more eyes for what they were n't wearing. `` My costume? I'm a caveman, of course,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischman </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officer who wore only a itsy-bitsy loincloth. `` Actually, I'm a dirty old man with very little on.'' More than 100 fundamentalist Christians mingled with the 40,000 revelers, passing out pamphlets and trying to keep things in check. Fest organizers have cut out the too-titillating outfits worn by some in the parade's early years. `` It's a chance to let your hair down and be crazy.'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheckler </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> who has been to two other Fantasy Fests. The parade culminated seven days of masquerade balls, costume contests and other zany events. Even four-legged masqueraders got into the party spirit with a pet costume contest.

The rampage began near <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>, about 100 miles southeast of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. As the tractor-trailer continued west on I-10, it rammed a four-wheel-drive vehicle driven by <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Agutter </PERSON>.

 The tradition of arson in the days before Halloween appears to be fading, but Devil's Night will burn brightly for some time in the mind of <PERSON> Mamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, whose home was threatened by a burning house next door. King watched as flames consumed a neighboring house and threatened her own home early today. She fought to hold back tears as firefighters doused her roof to keep the fire from spreading. `` It started in a garage and spread to the two houses next to mine,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` Somebody had to have set it. ... There's just no excuse for it.'' Firefighters saved King's house but the two other dwellings were gutted, leaving at least three people homeless, including a 77-year-old invalid. Devil's Night, traditionally a night of pranks in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, grew into a night of arson, peaking in 1984 with 810 fires that killed one person and left dozens homeless. Last year, the number dropped to 290 fires over a two-day holiday weekend. Firefighters questioned Sunday night said the downward trend appears to be continuing this year. `` It seems to be going down every year,'' said one firefighter, who declined to give his name. `` Maybe people are getting tired of it -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Devil </ORGANIZATION>'s Night -RRB-.'' The number of arson fires during this Devil's Night weekend wo n't be available until Tuesday or Wednesday, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, a spokesman for Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. About 20,000 citizen volunteers joined city employees in patrolling the streets. The volunteer force, including members of citizens band radio clubs, block clubs and other organizations, was twice the number deployed in the past few years, <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said. Fascination with the Devil's Night tradition drew observers from all over the country. `` Yeah, I got some raised eyebrows when I told people I was going to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> for the weekend,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, a College Park, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, resident. `` But there's nothing like Devil's Night in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, a volunteer firefighter, said he and three friends flew to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> for a weekend of chasing fires and taking pictures. `` We like seeing a big city fire department in action, and we're guaranteed of seeing some action on Devil's Night,'' <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> said Officer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaharoff </PERSON>, a police spokesman, said no arson-related arrests were reported Sunday. A 6 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew for youths under 18 took effect Saturday night and will continue through Tuesday night. Police picked up 119 youngsters Sunday night and 278 on Saturday night for violating the curfew, <PERSON> Zaharoff </PERSON> said. Elsewhere, Halloween festivities resulted in the arrest of 125 people in the college town of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Police said between 8,000 and 10,000 people, mostly <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students, took over a section of town Saturday night for the celebration. Most of the arrests were for disorderly conduct. In Kent, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, home of <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, police say 32 people were arrested during a downtown Halloween celebration. In <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, police arrested more than 190 people during a two-day Halloween street festival. `` It was a typical beer blast with drinking in the streets,'' said <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>. `` What happened is about par for the course _ as people get drunker they get a little rowdier ... and there are usually more than 100 arrests.'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said there were no serious injuries to police or the more than 15,000 festival-goers.

 The dollar was lower against major currencies in thin European mid-morning trading today ahead of a religious holiday in several countries. Gold prices rose. Foreign exchange dealers said pressure to square trading positions before the end of the month partly caused the slight lowering of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. They said trading rooms were closing down in a number of European countries for All Saints Day on Tuesday, and other dealers had taken a four-day weekend. They added that the dollar was unlikely to suffer sharp swings this week before the Nov. 8 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election. `` No matter who wins the market will still be bearish on the dollar,'' said a trader in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 1.08 Japanese yen to a closing 125.00 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it rose slightly to 124.95 yen.

<HEAD>Girl Injured With Lawn Dart Emerges From Drug-Induced Coma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 11-year-old girl whose skull was pierced by a lawn dart has emerged from her drug-induced coma, a hospital spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> McMinnville </ORGANIZATION> regained consciousness early Sunday morning, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Doctors Saturday stopped administering the coma-inducing drugs. The child's doctors are `` pleased that she is responding as she is,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. `` But they will be evaluating that over the next few days now that she has regained consciousness.'' <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> underwent eight hours of surgery last Tuesday to remove the metal and plastic dart that was stuck 2 inches into her head. Doctors put her into a coma to keep her brain activity to a minimum until swelling subsided. The child remained in critical condition and doctors planned to administer tests to determine the amount of brain damage she may have suffered. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> and some friends were playing with a neighbor's lawn dart set when the girl bent over to pick up a dart and was struck by another dart tossed by her cousin, said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>'s mother. The Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> voted Friday to ban the sale of lawn darts. Proponents of the ban said the darts have severely injured about 6,700 people, mostly children under 15, and resulted in three deaths. The ban, which goes into effect in mid-December, requires that the products no longer be sold, manufactured or imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of American hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s videotaped message: My name is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. And it's October 30. Once again I'm being given a chance to speak to my family, to my friends and to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. First to my family. I love you and I miss you very much. I know of your continued strong efforts for me, the work and devotion of many friends and colleagues and of the many people I do n't know, like -LRB- American entertainer -RRB- Mr. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. I know I can never repay you. But I thank you and pray for you as you do for me. I'm well and being well treated. I received your birthday greetings and as always that helped me very much. But as my fourth birthday in captivity passes and as the end of my fourth year -LRB- in captivity -RRB- approaches, I find it difficult to keep my hopes and my courage high. The news I hear tells me that you've not forgotten -LRB- me -RRB- and I know you will not. But the difficulty seems enormous. I've been very close to being released several times over the past two years. But each time it seems that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government uses its influence to stop any agreement of being made. And I do n't understand this I'm not asking President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to deal with terrorists, although both he and Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did so in the Iran-Contra affair and the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijack. Our problem could have been solved long ago without such complications as arms deals. With the Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the Lebanese in Israeli-run prisons, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is no different. All that is necessary is that Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, if he is elected, use their influence in a positive way, not a negative one, with those who are trying to find a way out of this terrible impasse. I gather there's been very little discussion about this problem in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential campaign and that's disappointing, as is President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s complete failure to find a solution during his eight years in office. But whichever candidate wins this election, remember an unyielding refusal to deal with this matter is not going to make it go away. It is not going to free us. I heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious effort to free three trapped whales a few days ago and the president's thanks to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for its help. It's a warming story. That kind of cooperation and spirit is absolutely necessary to bring this situation to an end. Once again, this has gone on too long. It ca n't continue like this. Peg, <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON>, Dad, kiss my daughters for me. Keep your spirits up and I will try to do the same. And one day, soon God willing, this will end.

 Anti-abortion protests nationwide resulted in the arrests of more than 2,000 demonstrators who tried to block entrances to clinics and turn away patients, organizers said. Operation Rescue, the New York-based organization that sponsored the demonstrations, said 2,212 persons were arrested in 27 cities Saturday and in four cities on Friday. Organizers of rallies in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, where 367 were arrested, and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where 138 werlvania. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, one woman yelled `` Save your child! Give your life to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>!'' as sheriff's deputies escorted a woman into a suburban clinic. Among the 203 cited or arrested were several <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> ministers and three Roman Catholic priests. In <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a Planned Parenthood clinic employee was slightly injured when protesters, thinking she was a patient, dove in her path to stop her from entering. Police arrested 20 demonstrators there. Clinic Director <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> June </PERSON> said abortions account for only about 5 percent of the clinic's business, and that the rest is birth control. `` We'd like them -LRB- protesters -RRB- to find a constructive way to help women not get pregnant in the first place'' she said. Operation Rescue began blocking clinic entrances on July 19 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> during the Democratic National Convention. About 7,000 sympathizers have been arrested nationwide since then, 1,200 of them in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. On Saturday, some sympathizers prayed and sang hymns as police arrested others. Counter-demonstrators chanted, `` Right to Life, your name's a lie, you do n't care if women die,'' and `` Not the church, not the state, women will decide their fate.'' Among other cities, arrests were made in <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Miss.; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; and the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> police arrested 11 people at one clinic. Nearly 160 people were arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Friday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 133 demonstrators who defied a court order and the threat of a stiff fine were also arrested Saturday after a loud but peaceful demonstration on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Demonstrators were generally peaceful, but in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where police arrested 40, a man who tried to stop a police motorcycle from entering clinic property was handcuffed and arrested. In <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, Acting Gov. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told a rally of pro-choice demonstrators that only Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, would protect their right to a legal abortion. `` We must get up and exercise our choice for the candidate who believes women have a right to control our bodies. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believes women are criminals,'' she said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is campaigning against abortion. Anti-abortion groups had advertised plans to protest in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Saturday but instead decided before dawn to move their demonstration south to <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where 60 arrests were reported, police dragged one man 50 yards on his belly to a police vehicle but most cities reported gentle arrest tactics and only minimal resistance by protesters. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> police were widely criticized in early October for rough arrest tactics used on Operation Rescue demonstrators who went limp and refused to walk to police buses.

<TEXT>
 There may be an insidious media bias at work this election year, but it is n't the publishers tilting Republican or the networks showing an Eastern Establishment slant for the Democrats. No, it's an anti-ideological prejudice in favor of a close election. Close elections make better stories. Close elections make it seem as if the American Democracy is in some kind of wonderful balance. Close elections are fun to cover. Close elections give journalists and politicians something to talk about over drinks after work. Journalists _ like gardeners, accountants and electrical contractors _ tend to pursue their own best interests. If there is a close race, they like it to stay that way. But if one candidate moves way ahead of another, journalism can often trigger mysterious forces that test a front-runner's mettle or encourage the underdog's heroic comeback effort. In races like those for <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats, there is little anyone can do to boost the fortunes of anonymous and underfinanced challengers against popular incumbents like <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>. In races for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, where 90-odd percent of the 435 seats will be won by incumbents, journalism ca n't even provide a finger for the dike. But the presidential campaign is another matter altogether, and the bias for a close race has been a subtle dynamic in the titanic struggle of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, overshadowed rightfully by the exertions of the candidates themselves and the volatility of an electorate apparently enamored so far with neither candidate. Today <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leads the race and the bias for a close election is benefiting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would complain, except that he's benefited from the same process and might need to again _ say next weekend, for example. Also, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not like to anger the other constituency, aside from journalists, who welcome a close race _ voters. From a voter's perspective: Close elections make for humble and responsive public officials. Close elections make it seem as if the American Democracy is in some kind of wonderful balance. Close elections are fun to watch on TV. The ads become especially entertaining, even if the debates tend to wax insufferable. Close elections make it seem as if every voter counts, even those on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The roles of campaign journalism _ to ask tough questions, describe the character of candidates under pressure, constantly gauge public interest and reaction _ are consistent with this voter interest in close elections. Campaign coverage will often: _ Raise new and sharply tougher questions about the front-runner. This happened to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> during his brief stay atop the GOP primary race. He won <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and sought a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> knockout of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> waged a great comeback campaign, his forces fanning reporters' questions about the operation of Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s trust fund. -LRB- It did n't hurt that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> allies controlled the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> GOP and he began primary week with a big lead -RRB-. _ Raise the underdog's visibility. This is happening now with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is deluged with TV invitations and is using the platform to explain his values to voters who are just now tuning into the election process. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, offered the same opportunities, has the most to lose from TV exposure, and so he's limiting his appearances to the morning talk shows. If he slips in the polls, he'll change his strategy before you can say, `` Live from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it's Saturday Night.'' _ Write encouraging things about the dauntless, dignified, suddenly impassioned comeback kid. Dust off the 1948 <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> stories, explain how the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> math provides a glimmer of Election Day hope. How can we tell if the presidential election is tightening? Journalists now use `` tracking polls'' to identify and publicize one-day trends in public opinion. If those ubiquitous `` likely voters'' provide good news for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ like they did last Thursday, for example, journalists and voters will be sensing a comeback. `` We thought from the beginning,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday while bus stopping his way through <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, wary of resisting the public will for a tight campaign, `` that it would be close right up to the end.''

<HEAD>Doctor's Case To Examine Right-to-Die Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A doctor who said he drugged his cancer-stricken wife so she could end her life with dignity goes on trial more than two years later for her murder. Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>, 47, is charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and attempted first-degree murder. His trial was scheduled to begin today. `` This is something that is done in the medical community all the time,'' said his attorney, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON>. `` Doctors assist their terminally ill patients who want to die, and everybody just winks at it. `` To put him in the same category as an organized crime figure or someone who robs a 7-Eleven in the middle of the night is absurd.'' <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> said he would call doctors and mercy-killing experts to testify for the defense. Rosier is accused of giving his 43-year-old wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>, a 6-milligram morphine injection and 80-milligram morphine suppository on Jan. 5, 1986. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> says his wife also took 20 tablets of Seconal, a sleeping pill, which he did n't administer. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisotsky </PERSON>, a Nova University law professor assisting the defense, said the drugs the doctor gave to his wife were n't enough to kill her. After the drugs were administered, Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> lay near death for hours and her stepfather, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Delham </PERSON>, finished the effort by suffocating her, according to court records. <ORGANIZATION> Delham </ORGANIZATION> and his two sons, who said they were in the room, have been granted immunity from prosecution and are expected to be state's witnesses. Rosier immediately opened himself to suspicion by going on <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myers </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> WBBH </ORGANIZATION> in November 1986 to talk about his 641-page book `` The Lady.'' It was about his and his wife's lives, and her death. Rosier, a retired pathologist, may have exhibited `` colossal stupidity'' by going public with the act, but that does n't make him a murderer, <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wisotsky </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> had a constitutional right to die with dignity, but prosecutor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> has asked <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> to prohibit any discussion of euthanasia and morality. `` Philosophy, ethics, morality will confuse the jury and they will not be able to reach an acceptable verdict based on the law,'' <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> was sworn in for a sixth five-year term today after capturing 95 percent of ballots in elections at which he was sole presidential candidate. Hundreds of supporters cheered and sang as <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, 64, arrived at the High Court for the ceremony. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> told them their votes had given him `` marching orders'' to resolve <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s economic woes, including record inflation, unprecedented unemployment and a foreign debt of $ 5 billion. `` We are likely to face even more and greater problems over the next five years,'' said <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>. `` But I am confident that we shall pull through.'' To stay in power, the <LOCATION> Zambian </LOCATION> leader needed a simple majority of ballots cast by voters who were asked specifically to vote for or against him. Only 4.5 percent of those who went to polls last Wednesday voted against him. Officials said 56 percent of 2.6 million registered voters took part. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> was nominated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the country's only legal political movement since he declared <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> a one-party state in 1972. He is expected to name his 24-member Cabinet on Wednesday, aides said. Four Cabinet ministers and two ministers of state were rejected at the polls, reflecting popular hostility toward official mismanagement and corruption. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> led the British colony of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> to independence as <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> on Oct. 24, 1964.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans to withdraw its first warship from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> this week, a small but important step that reflects confidence in the Iraq-Iran cease-fire, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources say. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that barring a last-minute change in plans the missile frigate USS <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was to be detached from duty Tuesday and sail for home port in <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The 3,600-ton frigate would be the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship pulled out of the gulf since <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to an Aug. 20 cease-fire in their eight-year war. The ship's departure would trim overall American naval strength in the region to 25 vessels. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> says the gulf force will gradually be scaled back to a pre-war level of about five ships if the cease-fire stays in effect. Since the truce, no flareups have been reported in the waterway, where more than 500 commercial ships were damaged by air and gunboat attacks related to the war. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> refused comment, citing a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy of not discussing ship movements or locations for security reasons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships are regularly rotated on a six-month basis, with about three months on duty in the gulf. The <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> arrived Sept. 9 and was to have left in January. The fleet dropped to 26 ships when the missile cruiser USS Vincennes left the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Sept. 5. The sailing orders of its designated replacement, the USS Mobile Bay, were canceled a day before it was to leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In other moves toward reducing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence, officials ended 17 months of close escort of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti oil tankers, curtailed regional air surveillance and took a fortified barge off station in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gulf </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> squadron inside the gulf, normally about 16 ships, includes six mine-sweepers, an amphibious landing ship, and the flagship USS La Salle. There are also two missile cruisers, one missile destroyer, and four frigates besides the <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. The missile cruiser USS Reeves and missile frigate USS <PERSON> Vandegrift </PERSON> also are scheduled to leave in the next week but will be replaced, the sources said.

 Two <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissidents were jailed for their part in protests demanding freedom for hundreds of people they say are political prisoners, a dissident source said today. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said police arrested <PERSON> Valeriya </PERSON> <PERSON> Novodvorskaya </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Starikov </PERSON> on Sunday and they were given 15-day jail sentences. <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> is a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a group that bills itself as an alternative to the Communist Party. At least 50 people were arrested as hundreds of demonstrators marked an imprisoned poet's death by protests demanding the release of hundreds they say are political prisoners, <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said. About 40 people were arrested in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, 14 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and four in <LOCATION> Novosibirsk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said. A few thousand people gathered separately in <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Byelorussian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, to commemorate the victims of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Fourteen people were arrested there, <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Novodvorskaya </PERSON> was arrested on her way to a planned demonstration on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> along with several other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> leaders. A crowd of several hundred people gathered on the square in the cold and snow Sunday evening, but no protest took place. <PERSON> Starikov </PERSON> was arrested when he raised a banner demanding freedom for political prisoners after most of the crowd left, <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said. Earlier Sunday, five members of another group were arrested on the square for their brief protest. <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said 200-300 people gathered to read poetry and hold candles along <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Nevsky </PERSON> <PERSON> Prospket </PERSON> near Kazan Cathedral. At least 40 of them were arrested, he said. A crowd of several thousand gathered near the police station where they were taken, shouting angry slogans, he said. A <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> dissident source said all but 10 of those arrested were freed by Monday. Sunday was the 16th anniversary of the death in a labor camp of <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Galanskov </PERSON>, a poet and pacifist who was an editor of the dissident journal <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> 66. He was sentenced to seven years in a labor camp in 1968. Sunday's protests came just days after Soviet officials reportedly promised West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> that they would release within 10 weeks all those regarded by the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as political prisoners. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> says it has only a few dozen political prisoners. But many Western human rights groups and Soviet dissident organizations say several hundred people still are held in prisons, labor camps, psychiatric hospitals, or in internal exile, because of their beliefs.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> said today it will end 26 years of economic isolationism and a rigidly controlled domestic economy and open its doors to foreign investment. There was no indication the government of Gen. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who seized power Sept. 18, would become liberal politically. `` <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> will practice a market-oriented trade policy in line with the world economic trend, both in domestic and foreign trade,'' Trade Minister Col. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> told a news briefing. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> said laws that would provide a favorable investment climate were being drafted and welcomed queries from both domestic and foreign investors on the new policies. He said items such as teak, petroleum and gems would remain under government monopoly but private enterprises could become involved in all other sectors of the economy. He said foreign investment would be permitted either directly or through joint ventures with the government or local private enterprises. But <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> said there were no plans to change the current official exchange rate of six kyats to one dollar. Under this rate, private exporters often receive less from their transaction than the cost of the export commodity. The black market rate has soared to more than 40 kyats to the dollar recently. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s economy spiraled downward last year and the country, according to experts, is virtually bankrupt following months of political unheaval and a freeze on aid by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other donors. The international community has condemned the military government for suppression of popular dissent which began late July following the retirement of Ne Win. Ne Win, who seized power in a 1962 military coup, imposed a centrally directed economy and banned all private foreign investment. Under his authoritarian rule, one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s potentially richest nations became among the world's poorest with an annual per capita income currently estimated at below $ 150. Reaction from foreign investors to the plans <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> spelled out was expected to be cautious, given the potentially chaotic political situation and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s earlier backtracking on promises of economic reform. Since late July thousands have been killed by an authoritarian regime trying to maintain its power in face of nationwide protest. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has allowed the formation of political parties and promised a general election but opposition leaders are skeptical that a free and fair election can be held while the military wield power. The minister said cross border trade was opened at two points with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> recently and similar arrangements were expected to follow along <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s frontiers with <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. In the past, the government has lost vast revenues because it was unable to control smuggling across the country's frontiers. The border with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, across which most commodities enter <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, is largely controlled by ethnic minority insurgent groups fighting the central government.

<HEAD>Fernald Workers Report Regular Uranium Exposure, Report Saysa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than half of the long-term workers at the <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> uranium processing plant say they've been exposed to uranium frequently over the years, a newspaper reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that a federal study found a close relationship between workers' reports of exposure to uranium and medical problems, including shortness of breath. The report was the latest in a series of revelations of problems at the Feed Materials Production Center near <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, a small town north of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, and at other federal nuclear weapons plants. The plant, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, processes uranium for weapons. The study was requested by one of the unions that represent <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> workers. It was performed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The Enquirer said an interim report dated July 1987 found that some workers were so severely affected that they could not walk short distances without stopping for breath. The study was limited to workers who had been employed at the Fernald plant for more than 10 years. Of the 208 such employees, 146 agreed to participate in the study. They had worked at the plant an average of 32 years. The Enquirer said 93 of the 146 workers estimated that they had been regularly or frequently exposed to uranium. Forty-nine had been exposed at least 10 times, while 38 workers said they were exposed at least 20 times. Even after accounting for cigarette smoking, 32 percent of the workers had shortness of breath, the study found, including nine workers who could not walk more than 100 yards without stopping to breathe heavily. One-fourth of the workers had restricted or obstructed lung functions. The study was requested by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 625 of the plant's 1,500 full-time workers. The plant's unions are on strike, citing safety and health concerns as well as wage and benefit disagreements. Production at the plant has been stopped since Oct. 7. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>'s Machinists local, said the <ORGANIZATION> NIOSH </ORGANIZATION> report is being reviewed by the unions. `` It's difficult to know who to trust,'' Day said. `` Right now we do trust <ORGANIZATION> NIOSH </ORGANIZATION>.'' Dr. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Singal </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NIOSH </ORGANIZATION>, who prepared the study, said the federal institute is still researching the working environment at the plant, but has closed its investigation into medical effects on workers. `` There were some additional analyses done'' after the interim study was completed in 1987, `` but those analyses did n't change the initial conclusions,'' <PERSON> Singal </PERSON> told the Enquirer. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Reafsnyder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> site representative at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, said over the weekend that he was not familiar with the study results.

<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In July 1984, a wealthy matron and her daughter were shot to death at their sprawling home northeast of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. In May 1985, three members of a well-to-do <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, family were found slain. Two sets of killings, months and miles apart, but tied together by a tale of failed marriage, an incestuous relationship and a bitter child custody battle. When authorities finally caught up with the suspects, they committed suicide in a car explosion after killing the two boys at the center of the custody dispute. The story was apparent to investigators in retrospect; according to a new book, it could have become apparent much sooner, before the second set of killings, but for the mistakes of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> authorities. `` Bitter Blood,'' by <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- News & amp; Record reporter <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON>, looks at the slayings of <PERSON> Delores </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, 68, and her daughter, Dr. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, 39, of Prospect, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and the aftermath. Mrs. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> also had a son, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, a dentist in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, N.M. He had been married from 1970 to 1981 to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>. As part of his investigation into the Lynches' slayings, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, then an investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, requested a check on <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>. The check showed that a camping trailer was jointly registered to her and a <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Klenner </PERSON>, 32. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> then sought a check on <PERSON> Klenner </PERSON> and was told that he was a doctor with no criminal record. An apparent dead end. But <PERSON> Klenner </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>'s first cousin, was not what he appeared to be. Despite a widespread belief among people in his hometown of <LOCATION> Reidsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, that he was a physician, he had never attended medical school. At least one person knew that and had complained to authorities, who compiled a detailed file on him, according to the book. In the file, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> agent described <PERSON> Klenner </PERSON> as a survivalist `` gun nut.'' According to the file, <PERSON> Klenner </PERSON> was `` paranoid and spent all of his money on exotic military weapons that he carried wherever he went.'' Had <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> been given this file by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> authorities, he would have focused on Klenner immediately, according to `` Bitter Blood.'' <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> agrees. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> SBI officials refused to talk to <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON> for his book, and the bureau in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> recently declined to comment to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. After the <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> killings, 10 months of fruitless investigation passed. Then, on May 18, 1985, <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>, and her grandmother, <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>, were shot dead. With the second set of slayings, the family tie became clear. All five victims, apparently upset by <PERSON> Klenner </PERSON>'s courtship of <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, had planned to testify against her at a hearing that summer over the custody of her sons. Both families were wealthy, and a desire for the inheritances may have played a role as well, investigators said at the time. But the real motive will never be known. By early June, authorities had decided to arrest Klenner on murder charges in the <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> family slayings because he was planning to leave the state and had threatened witnesses, they said. On June 4, they caught up with his van and began a chase. With <PERSON> Klenner </PERSON> was <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> and the two boys. As police closed in, the van exploded. <PERSON> Klenner </PERSON> and his lover were killed by the explosion; authorities discovered that the boys, ages 8 and 10, already had been killed _ poisoned with cyanide and shot in the head. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Klenner </PERSON> had to have detonated the bomb, and authorities believe <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> knew of all the slayings and died willingly as well. After the explosion, <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> and his investigators returned to <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> to finish their investigation of the <LOCATION> Oldham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> killings. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> got phone records that led him to the gun store in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Klenner </PERSON> did most of his trading. He found that <PERSON> Klenner </PERSON> had traded a rifle _ the same type of weapon used to kill the Lynches _ to that dealer the day after the killings. Ballistics tests linked a bullet found at the <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> home to the gun. Three months after the explosion, an <LOCATION> Oldham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury found that <PERSON> Klenner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> were responsible for the <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> killings. `` I wanted to be able to tell the people ... that there was n't a killer in their midst, and I wanted to be sure about what I was telling them,'' <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Sick Sea Lion Attacks on Land, Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAUSALITO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sea lion apparently suffering from a liver and kidney disease attacked a swimmer and a beach stroller over the weekend, prompting authorities to issue their first-ever sea lion warning. `` We've never even heard of something like that, where a sea lion would actually attack somebody swimming,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON>, director of public relations for the Marine Mammal Center. `` In the water, the animal typically feels it has nothing to fear from a human.'' The center warned swimmers plying the chilly waters of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to avoid all sea lions. A swimmer was bitten off Aquatic Park in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on Saturday. The sea lion `` just swam up to the poor guy and gratuitously bit him on the side of the chest and on the foot,'' <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON> said. The unidentified swimmer was admitted to a hospital and received `` the normal animal-bite treatment,'' <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON> said. The same day, the sea lion attacked a woman who was walking on the beach off <LOCATION> Crissy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> a few miles from where the swimmer was attacked, <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON> said. The woman thought the animal was sick and wanted to help. `` She meant well, but she got bit because she placed herself right between the animal and where he wanted to go _ the beach,'' she said. The sea lion, which weighs between 60 and 80 pounds, has two red tags on its flippers, meaning it was born near the <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON> speculated that the sea lion was suffering from a disease called Leptospirosis, an often fatal sickness of the liver and kidney. Three rescue teams searched for the sea lion over the weeked but were unsuccessful.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders today vowed to avenge the deaths of a Jewish woman and her three sons in the firebombing of a bus. The army said the Palestinian attackers were in custody, and there were reports two had confessed. The attack in this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town came 35 hours before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliamentary elections It could drive undecided voters to the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who has advocated a hard line in dealing with violence. In newspaper interviews published today, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and his rival, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, promised revenge for Sunday's attack. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> asked the army's chief prosecutor to investigate whether the death penalty could be used against the assailants, calling them `` murderers of women and children who have lost all shades of humanity,'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. The radio said the army rounded up dozens of Palestinians in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>. It said two suspects in custody admitted taking part in the attack. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> today, more than 1,000 mourners attended a funeral for the victim, 27-year-old <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, and her sons, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON>, <PERSON> Netanel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Efraim </PERSON>, aged 9 months to 3 -LCB- years. Many mourners wept and wore the traditional black clothes of Orthodox Jews. A banner stetched across the street said `` Oh what has befallen us?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, her husband and her sons lived in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and were returning home from northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> at the time of the attack on the bus. The husband escaped without serious injury, army officials said. Five other bus passengers were injured in the attac, one a soldier who was seriously burned. Two of those injured are immigrants from <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON>, 35, who suffered serious burns on his face, and his wife, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, burned on her face and back, said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mekel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The attack claimed the largest number of Israeli lives in a single assault since the Palestinian revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> broke out almost 11 months ago A total of 305 Palestinians and 10 Israelis have been killed in the uprising, which began Dec. 8. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> commander, told reporters in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> today that a curfew was imposed on the town of about 17,000 Arabs 18 miles east of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The attackers tossed the firebombs from a banana plantation next to the road. As reporters watched today, an army bulldozer plowed under rows of banana trees to prevent future ambushes. Soldiers, some using police dogs, searched door to door. Officers said the attack was meticulously planned, but <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> played down a connection with the elections: `` The timing is just two days before the election, but it is not the first time that firebombs were thrown on -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> -RRB- roads.'' In the past two months, there have been more than 100 firebomb attacks in the <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> area, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said firebombs were hurled at the bus by Palestinians at about 8:15 p.m.. One broke through a window, setting afire the back seat where the children were sitting `` Two or three Molotov cocktails were thrown at the bus, which went up in flames in seconds,'' <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said. The driver slammed on the brakes, and most of the 22 passengers scrambled to safety. A soldier, identified only as Sgt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>, boarded the red-and-white Egged bus No. 961 and found a woman still aboard. `` From the back of the bus I heard the sound of a trapped woman,'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` I grabbed her with one hand. I said, ` Come out with me.' She absolutely refused.'' `` She screamed, ` But I have a baby, what about the baby!' After a few seconds, I realized that if I remained one more second -LRB- I would be killed -RRB-.'' Capt. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON>, who arrived moments after the bus caught fire, told reporters the woman apparently panicked and feared leaving the bus because she thought terrorists were outside. Reporters were kept away from the scene until dawn and the bus was gone by the time photographers arrived. However, one witness said the bus was consumed by fire, its tires melted into the asphalt. Speaking on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he did not think the attack was linked to the elections, saying there was no logic to such acts of hatred. `` I am sure the security forces will reach the murderers,'' he said. `` I hope the murderers and those who sent them and their supporters will feel the serious consequences to them and their surroundings of their heinous hatred towards us.'' But Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, at an election rally in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, accused <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> liberals of creating an atmosphere for such attacks, by saying: `` All talk of withdrawal or pullbacks brings more and more firebomb attacks,'' newspapers reported. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted as telling the Hadashot daily: `` This despicable act in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> deserves an appropriate response that will prove to the murderers they will be punished to the full extent of the law.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was quoted by the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> as saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was united into `` one family'' by such attacks. `` Neither terrorism nor violence will determine our path. We will determine our path,'' he said. `` Deeds such as tonight's tear at the heart and provide nothing in the way of hope for a solution.''

<HEAD>Court Kills Lawsuit Stemming From Japanese-American Internments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today killed a lawsuit against the government stemming from the World War II mass detention of Japanese-Americans in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prison camps. The court, without comment, left intact rulings that the veterans of the internment camps waited too long to file suit seeking compensation for property losses. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration this year officially acknowledged that the Japanese-Americans were treated unjustly. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation on Aug. 10 that provides a $ 20,000 tax-free payment to each of some 60,000 survivors among the 120,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry who were placed in the camps. Noting that the detainees were forced to leave their homes and placed in concentration camps for up to four years, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the reparations had `` less to do with property than with honor.'' The bill calls for a $ 1.2 billion fund, with appropriations in any one year to be no more than $ 500 million. But the new law did not make the case acted on today by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> a dead issue. The legislation allowed anyone who does not seek reparations from the fund to pursue the lawsuit. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposed the suit on grounds the statute of limitations, or deadline, for filing such court claims has long since passed. The detainees argued the deadline should be suspended because the government's deception in concealing the real reason for the internment _ racism rather than military necessity _ was not exposed until decades after the war ended. They said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> itself was deceived in 1944 when it upheld the internment program. The administration said the high court was not hoodwinked. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the government based the internment policy on its belief that `` ancestral, cultural and ethnic considerations'' made it likely those of Japanese ancestry would engage in subversive activity. In the wake of the Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in 1941, the government forcibly removed from their homes those of Japanese ancestry living in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> authorized the internment, acting on advice by military leaders that people of <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> descent could not be trusted. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1944 ruling upheld the internment program as a constitutionally acceptable military necessity. By the mid-1970s, government documents were discovered that indicated there was no such military necessity. Then, 19 survivors and descendants of those interned filed suit in 1983 in behalf of all 120,000. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1986 that the government must defend itself at trial against the suit. But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in June 1987 said the appeals court did not have authority over the case and sent it instead to a different court, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION>. That appeals court, in a 2-1 ruling last May, said the suit was barred by the statute of limitations. The deadline question had not been addressed by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> when the justices issued their ruling last year. The case is <PERSON> Hohri </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-215.

 Gang-related violence killed two 17-year-olds and wounded at least 13, including a toddler who was shot in the head, after 200 police officers conducted an anti-gang sweep of the area. Police said 15-month-old <PERSON> Dalafayette </PERSON> <PERSON> Polk </PERSON> was struck in the head by a shotgun blast Sunday night during a drive-by attack on a birthday party in the Watts section of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The boy was in critical condition today at <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr.-Drew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>. The boy's mother, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, was in good condition with a gunshot wound to the foot, said <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>. Eight others were wounded in the attack. The shooters shouted gang slogans as they drove by and opened fire, but the people attending the party apparently were not gang members, said Lt. O.L. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The motive for the attack was unknown and there were no arrests. `` We were across the street at a birthday party and heard shots and smelled burned rubber,'' said neighbor <LOCATION> Shyolanda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 12. `` Everybody was just starting to leave when they got shot.'' The shooting occurred 16 hours after 200 police officers ended a two-night, anti-gang sweep, arresting 365 people, including 193 reputed gang members, said Officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugerian </PERSON>. The offenses included driving under the influence, curfew violations and outstanding felony and misdemeanor warrants. In nearby <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, 17-year-old <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> was gunned down Sunday night after neighbors had repeatedly called police to report gang trouble brewing. Neighbors said gang problems have grown worse in the neighborhood in the past months because of a turf war. Resident <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellman </PERSON> said Sunday night's trouble began when 15 youngsters began throwing bottles at cars. <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hohl </PERSON> confirmed that police received several calls about the disturbance, but added that reports of bottles being thrown would not be considered a high priority for police. Also Sunday, 17-year-old <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Orellana </PERSON> was shot and killed by rival gang members while he was walking with friends in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, said Detective <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Monsue </PERSON>. No arrests were made. On Saturday, three officers answering a report of a shooting outside a party attended by gang members came upon a man allegedly firing at a teen-ager, said Detective <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuckles </PERSON>. The gunman ignored orders to stop shooting and drop his weapon, and the three officers fired 28 shots, striking him four times, said <PERSON> Nuckles </PERSON>. The gunman was in serious condition at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> County-USC Medical Center and the teen-ager was treated for a minor gunshot wound. In another shooting, two men shouting gang slogans from a car fired at least six times with a pistol and a shotgun at a reputed gang member and a woman in the city's southside early Sunday, police said. The woman was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr.-Drew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> with a shotgun wound to the abdomen, said Officer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Issue on Lawyers for Indigent Death Row Inmates in
Virginia Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether states must continue to provide lawyers for indigent death row inmates after they have lost their initial round of appeals. The court said it will hear an appeal by <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> officials who said requiring states to pay for attorneys in such cases could lead to interminable delays in carrying out executions. The justices are expected to announce their decision in 1989. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, in a 6-4 ruling last June, said condemned murderers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> who can not afford a lawyer are entitled to greater representation at taxpayer expense than the state provides. Attorneys are provided by the state when a death row inmate files an initial appeal in state courts. Convicted killers who lose that round may pursue a second round of appeals in state courts, contending that their rights were violated. But they are not entitled to free legal representation during this second phase if they are unable to afford their own lawyer. Like other states, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> provides prison law libraries and assigns part-time lawyers to help inmates prepare their second-round _ or collateral _ appeals. In some cases, volunteer lawyers are available to help the prisoners. But the 4th Circuit court said the Constitution requires more in the case of those on death row. `` The complexity and difficulty of the legal work involved in challenging a death penalty require particular safeguards in order to insure meaningful access'' to justice, the appeals court said. The appeals court also noted that inmates facing execution are likely to be emotionally incapable of preparing a cogent appeal. But the appeals court said death row inmates are not entitled to free legal help for a third round of appeals _ when they take their cases to federal court to claim their rights were violated. By the time the case reaches the federal courts, the appeals court said, the inmates will have legal briefs, trial transcripts and state court opinions from earlier state court appeals that will enable them to prepare their own defense effectively. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> officials said the 4th Circuit court ruling `` injects a palpable danger of infinite delay'' in resolving capital cases. The added guarantee of free legal representation will give death row inmates another opportunity to contend that they received ineffective assistance from their lawyers, the officials said. That could lead to another protracted round of appeals, they continued. The officials also said that most states with capital punishment do not guarantee free legal help beyond the first round of appeals. The state attorney general's office interpreted a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling to mean that the Constitution does not guarantee a right to a lawyer in collateral appeals. In the 1987 case, the justices ruled that a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> woman's constitutional right to adequate legal help had not been violated during an earlier appeal She claimed she was denied effective representation when her court-appointed lawyer concluded that her collateral appeal was fruitless. The 4th Circuit court said the 1987 ruling did not answer the constitutional question raised in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> case, particularly since the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> case did not involve the death penalty. The case is <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Giarratano </PERSON>, 88-411.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a ruling that a state may ban the possession of child pornography. The court, citing a lack of jurisdiction, rejected an appeal by an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> couple who say state officials are intruding into the privacy of the home to impose censorship. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case, one vote shy of the four needed to grant such review. The couple, <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Geever </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bartlett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, are awaiting trial on a 19-count indictment handed up by a state grand jury in 1985. While the Geevers also were accused of soliciting a child to appear in a pornographic video and taking indecent liberties with a child, 12 of the counts deal solely with possession of pornographic material. The state law provides a penalty of up to three years in prison and a $ 25,000 fine for possession of child pornography. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in March that outlawing possession of sexually explicit and lewd material depicting children under 18 does not violate the Constitution. `` The purpose of the statute ... is not to limit the indvidual's freedom of thought and mind in his own home, nor is its purpose to regulate the moral content of the depictions described,'' the state court said `` The purpose is to prevent the sexual abuse and exploitation of children by drying up the market for child pornography.'' The state court said state officials have a compelling interest in protecting children `` from the lasting harm of emotional and sexual degradation.'' At least 11 other states have made it a crime to possess child pornography. They are <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1969 that states may not forbid the mere possession of obscene material. The justices based that ruling on constitutional guarantees of free expression and on `` the right to be free, except in very limited circumstances, from unwanted governmental intrusions into one's privacy.'' The high court also has held, in 1982, that states may ban the sale and dissemination of child pornography, even if the material is not legally obscene. That ruling said fighting sexual exploitation of children is `` a government objective of surpassing importance.'' Since 1973, the court has defined materials as obscene _ and therefore unprotected by constitutionally guaranteed freedoms _ if they `` appeal to the prurient interest in sex ... portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, or when taken as a whole do not have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.'' The 1982 decision held that material depicting sexual activity by children does not have to meet that standard to be subject to criminal laws against distribution. The case is Geever vs. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, 88-381.

 An Afghan guerrilla leader today announced plans to form an all-rebel government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and said he hoped elections could be held by January. <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, chairman of the seven-member guerrilla alliance, outlined a plan under which Afghans inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and refugees outside the country would elect a 400-member Parliament. The <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would elect a head of state and approve a Cabinet, <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> said. The Pakistan-based guerrillas, or mujahedeen, announced similar plans in the spring, but they did n't materialize _ reportedly because of guerrilla infighting. `` As the mujahedeen have been successful on the battlefield, we can also be successful in the peace process,'' he told reporters in the Pakistani capital. <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> said the seven leaders of the guerrilla alliance unanimously adopted the plan. <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> said he and representatives of the six other guerrilla groups were leaving for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> later to attend talks at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on the war. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> takes up the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> issue this week. Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> called for an emergency meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the Afghan war, especially allegations that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is violating an accord by allowing guerrillas to receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid through Pakistani territory. The U.N.-mediated accord calls for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. It was signed in April in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> intervened in the Afghan conflict in December 1979 to replace one Marxist government with another.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Disturb Ban on Dial-a-Porn in New York Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, for the second time in six months, today refused to disturb a ban on sexually explicit telephone dial-up message services dubbed `` dial-a-porn.'' The justices, without comment, rejected arguments that such bans violate free-speech rights. Today's action in a case from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> sets no national precedent, and challenges to a new federal law banning all dial-a-porn services are expected to reach the high court soon. Such services have been available to callers through 976 numbers and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's 900 long-distance lines. The 976 and 900 exchanges also are used for other, non-controversial types of messages such as sports scores, time checks and stock market and weather reports. In the appeal acted on today, a group of dial-a-porn companies challenged an older, less restrictive version of the federal law that banned making `` any obscene or indecent communication by means of a telephone for commercial purposes to any person under 18 years of age.'' The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last January upheld the federal law as it applies to obscene material. But the appeals court said the law can not be enforced against merely sexually explicit material not deemed to be legally obscene. A federal trial judge in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> issued a similar decision last July 19 when ruling on a challenge to a dial-a-porn law enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on July 1. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashima </PERSON> ruled that the new law may be applied to obscene material but not to merely indecent material. The new law bans all dial-a-porn services _ offered to adults as well as to children. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lawyers say the law is unconstitutional. They support providing means of having the services available only to those who want them. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appealed <PERSON> Tashima </PERSON>'s ruling _ that portion blocking the law's enforcement against indecent but not obscene telephone messages _ directly to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The appeal is pending before the justices. The court last April let stand a ban on dial-a-porn message service in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> case acted on today, lawyers for various dial-a-porn companies argued, among other things, that the since-updated federal law `` creates an impermissible national standard of obscenity.'' They said past <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions on obscenity require that determinations of obscenity must be made according to local community standards. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Carlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, 88-37.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to overturn a $ 75,000 libel award to a <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> bar and restaurant that had the same name as a bar featured in an adult magazine's erotic fiction. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> magazine's publishers, who said they were unaware the restaurant in the article entitled `` Savage Lust'' bore any resemblance to a real business establishment. High Society was sued by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its president, <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Samad </PERSON>, owner of a restaurant called the Carousel on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. High Society is published by <ORGANIZATION> Drake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Savage Lust,'' which appeared in the December 1981 issue of the magazine, was a fictional account of a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> bar also called the Carousel. The article described the bar as a `` sailor's dive'' frequented by prostitutes and `` a symbol of tropical decadence and moral decay. The story described how a female customer was drugged, kidnapped and sexually assaulted by the owner. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Almeric </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> ruled that the article hurt the real Carousel's reputation and `` would deter a desirable clientele from patronizing the bar.'' <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, testified she was unaware there was a real bar on <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> called the Carousel. But Christian concluded she knew of the bar's existence since she had been a frequent visitor to St. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and could recall the names of businesses located on either side of the Carousel. The judge said <PERSON> Samad </PERSON> had proven that the article referred to his bar. `` The fact that fiction purports not to concern real persons or events is of no consequence in determining the merits of a defamation action,'' <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said. The judge added that the magazine was guilty of `` actual malice'' by acting `` with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity'' of the events described in the article. But <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said the magazine still could be forced to pay the libel award even if it was guilty only of negligence. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last April upheld the libel award in a one-page order. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> <PERSON> Publishers </PERSON> said the appeals court thus failed to examine the case carefully as required by a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> libel ruling. The appeals court `` has wrapped its decision-making and review process in a cloak of silence,'' the company said. `` Drake's right under the First Amendment to an independent appellate examination of the whole record can not be so lightly or easily sidestepped.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> Drake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Samad </PERSON>, 88-369.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by Justice Department Employees on Drug Tests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, declining to further expand its study of drug testing in the workplace, today rejected an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees who say such tests would violate their rights. The court, without comment, refused to intercede in the case _ which has yet to be argued before a lower court. The random drug-testing program for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> stems from an executive order by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1986 that authorizes heads of federal agencies to conduct tests for those in `` sensitive positions.'' The `` drug-free workplace plan'' adopted by former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> applies to numerous department employees, including anyone with access to top secret information, high-level appointees and attorneys and their assistants who conduct grand jury investigations. The program was challenged by 38 attorneys, three paralegals and one economist. They said requiring them to submit to random urine tests _ when there is no reason to suspect them of drug use _ violates their constitutional privacy rights. A federal judge blocked the tests pending further court action. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here scheduled arguments in the case for Dec. 15. But the department employees, saying they faced `` an unprecedented frontal assault on personal privacy and bodily integrity,'' appealed directly to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to decide the case without waiting for a lower court opinion. `` Hundreds of thousands of federal employees should not be left at risk of losing either their livelihood or their constitutional rights while awaiting resolution'' of the case, they said. They said those who `` refuse to urinate under surveillance and submit their urine to the government's fishing expedition for evidence of drug use'' would be fired unlawfully. Solicitor General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's top courtroom lawyer who would be subject himself to the drug tests, asked the high court to reject the appeal. `` The regular judicial process should be allowed to run its course'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> should keep hands off until the appeals court here reviews the case, he said. The justices previously agreed to examine drug tests in three cases to be decided by next July. They will determine whether a railroad company may routinely test its workers; whether the federal government may require the tests for railroad workers who have been involved in serious train accidents; and whether the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> may test those seeking jobs related to drug enforcement. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees said the tests planned for that agency are similar to those planned for hundreds of thousands of federal workers. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said that 345,000 federal employees are designated for random tests under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1986 order The case is <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, 88-427.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to allow the sale of T-shirts and other items parodying nuclear war with a design resembling an insurance company's trademark. The court, let stand a ruling that the design illegally infringes on the trademark of Mutual of <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case But the votes of at least four justices are required to grant such review. Mutual of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> sued <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>, who was living in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, when in 1983 he got the idea for the design. He said he used Mutual of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>'s logo as inspiration for his design showing the emaciated profile of a face wearing an Indian bonnet of burned or charred feathers with `` X'' in place of an eye. Alongside the Indian head was the inscription: Mutant of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Nuclear Holocaust Insurance. The Mutual of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> insignia is an Indian head with the company's name alongside. <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> sold about 4,000 T-shirts bearing his logo design on the front and on the back the message, `` When the world's in ashes we'll have you covered.'' <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> also placed the design on sweatshirts, caps, buttons and coffee mugs. A federal judge ruled that <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>'s use of the design could confuse people into believing that Mutual of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> was affiliated with the merchandise. The judge barred him from advertising or marketing the items. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in December 1987 upheld the injunction. The appeals court rejected <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>'s argument that his design is a legitimate exercise of free-speech rights. `` The protection afforded by the First Amendment does not give <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> license to infringe the rights of Mutual,'' the appeals court said. `` Given the circumstances of this case, Mutual's property rights should not yield.'' The appeals court said the injunction is not a blanket ban on <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>'s right of free expression. It does n't restrain him from engaging in `` editorial parody in a book, magazine or film,'' the appeals court said. The case is <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> vs. Mutual of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, 87-1908.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected an appeal by <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> prosecutors challenging state laws that broadly justify using deadly force to defend someone's home or personal property. The justices, without comment, let stand <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> laws that permit use of deadly force even by people not threatened with death or great bodily harm. The controversy arose when <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clothier </PERSON> was charged with involuntary manslaughter for fatally shooting a 15-year-old boy at his <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> home Nov. 23, 1986. Trial testimony established that Clothier was awakened in the pre-dawn hours that day by his dog's barking and growling. Taking a loaded revolver from his nightstand, Clothier looked out a window and saw someone in his driveway reaching into Clothier's van. <PERSON> Clothier </PERSON> said he was worried that the intruder would find his garage door opener in the van, and use it to gain access into his home. Clothier testified that he fired a warning shot and saw someone run behind the van and across the yard. He testified that he fired another warning shot at the ground before stepping outside the house. One of the bullets hit <PERSON> Seanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Picard </PERSON> in the head. The youth, who was unarmed, died a short time later. <LOCATION> Sedgwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutors charged Clothier with involuntary manslaughter in the shooting. But a jury acquitted him after being read what <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> law says about the defense of a dwelling and personal property. One law says a person `` is justified in the use of force ... he reasonably believes ... is necessary to prevent or terminate such other's unlawful entry into or attack upon his dwelling.'' Another law says a person may defend against the theft of his possessions with the `` degree of force or threat thereof as a reasonable man would deem necessary to prevent or terminate the interferenc.'' In the appeal acted on today, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> prosecutors urged the justices to `` change laws which give greater deference to property than to human life by striking down the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> statutes which allow this inequity.'' The appeal noted that there is `` no definitive, universal solution on the issue of using deadly force to defend one's home and property.'' The prosecutors said, for example, that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law justifies one person's killing another to protect land or property. They said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law `` goes so far as to permit the use of deadly force to prevent one from fleeing with property, even though the escapee is no longer a threat to the defender.'' Conversely, the appeal said, `` many states -LRB- have laws -RRB- holding that the use of deadly force which results in the taking of human life merely to defend any property is never reasonable.'' The appeal argued, `` It is absurd that a person who guns down a 15-year-old boy for tampering with his vehicle may be held to answer for his use of excessive force in one state but may shoot with impunity in another.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the prosecutors' arguments last April 29, saying their appeal `` presents essentially a quarrel with the legislative wisdom of deciding to grant the defenses set forth'' under the state laws. The case is <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> vs. Clothier, 88-168.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by Indiana Judge on Firing of Public

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today left intact a ruling that a judge may not fire public defenders because of their political affiliation. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> judge ordered to pay $ 61,075 to two assistant public defenders who sued the judge for violating their rights. The political patronage case stems from the appointment of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krajewski </PERSON> to be a <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> judge in 1985. He was named to replace <PERSON> Orval </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who was indicted on federal perjury charges. Nearly a year after he was appointed, <PERSON> Krajewski </PERSON>, a Republican, fired assistant public defenders <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholls </PERSON>, both Democrats. <PERSON> Krajewski </PERSON> said he dismissed the public defenders in a general house-cleaning of the office. <PERSON> Kurowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholls </PERSON> had served under the previous chief public defender, who had been convicted of criminal misconduct along with <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Kurowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholls </PERSON> said the real reason they were fired was because they were Democrats and <PERSON> Krajewski </PERSON> wanted to name Republicans to replace them. A federal magistrate awarded damages to the public defenders, and that ruling was upheld last June by the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court said the evidence was clear that the two men were fired because of their political affiliation. The appeals court also rejected <PERSON> Krajewski </PERSON>'s arguments that he had the proper authority to dismiss the public defenders for political reasons. Citing a 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, the appeals court said a judge may not fire assistant public defenders on political grounds. The 1980 high court ruling held that a chief public defender may not fire his assistants because of their political affiliation. The 7th Circuit court said that ruling `` turned on the characteristics of the assistant public defender's job, not on the office of the person doing the firing.'' The appeals court rejected <PERSON> Krajewski </PERSON>'s claim that assistant public defenders in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> hold `` policy-making'' jobs _ and therefore can be fired for political affiliation _ because public defenders are eligible to serve as temporary county court judges. The appeals court said that argument does not hold up because any lawyer in the state _ not just a public defender _ can be picked by a judge to fill in on the bench in the judge's absence. Judicial service is not part of the public defender's office, the appeals court said. Public defenders `` represent criminal defendants, and their loyalty as advocates runs to their clients, not to their employer,'' the appeals court said. <PERSON> Krajewski </PERSON> was ordered to pay $ 59,075 in compensatory damages and $ 2,000 in punitive damages to <PERSON> Kurowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholls </PERSON>, who also were ordered reinstated in the public defender jobs. They also were awarded $ 13,905 in reimbursement for their attorneys' fees. The case is <PERSON> Krajewski </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Kurowski </PERSON>, 88-391.

A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation of the 1981 contract between <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> government led to <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>'s pleading guilty to one count of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> was fined $ 75,000. Environmental Tectonics, which had submitted a lower bid for the Nigerian contract, then sued <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>. Its lawsuit alleged that Environmental Tectonics would have been awarded the contract but for <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>'s payment of bribes. A federal judge dismissed the suit, relying on the so-called `` act of state doctrine.'' It precludes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts from inquiring into the validity of a foreign government's acts committed within its own territory. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, however, reinstated the suit last May 2. `` The traditional justification for invoking the doctrine _ avoiding a judicial determination of the legal validity of a state's act within its own borders _ is not present in this case,'' the appeals court said. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> then sought the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s help.

<HEAD>Taxis Ring City Center In Protest Of Traffic Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 6,000 taxis ringed downtown <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> today and cabdrivers demonstrated outside the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to protest anti-pollution measures that restrict their access to the city. Half of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>' 800,000 cars _ including 25,000 taxis _ are banned from a five-square-mile zone around the city center between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m. on weekdays. Under the ban, introduced in January, vehicles with license plates ending in an even number alternate with those bearing an odd-numbered last digit. The drivers fiercely object to the ban because they say 50 percent of their fares are generated in the restricted zone. Today's protest, which caused a traffic jam in the center, followed a monthlong boycott of the restricted area by cabdrivers. `` It's ridiculous to say that we're solely to blame for <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>' pollution ... if the government really wants to solve the problem it should improve the quality of diesel gas and not restrict our movements in the city center,'' said taxi driver <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Loukas </PERSON>, 35 Environmental control authorities say that exhaust fumes from diesel-fueled taxis, aging buses and private cars are responsible for the high levels of atmospheric pollution in the capital. But taxi drivers claim they cause less than 7 percent of the pollution. `` That's not enough for the government to expect us to send our cars to the junk yard and buy others that run on lead-free petrol,'' said driver <PERSON> Panayiotis </PERSON> <PERSON> Liakos </PERSON>. Most Athens taxis run on diesel fuel, but more than 100 of them have recently converted to unleaded gasoline in a bid to bypass the ban. The government has said that all cabs running on unleaded gasoline would be able to move freely in the restricted zone. But the drivers, who earn an average take-home salary of about $ 400 a month, say they can not afford to make the change. `` How can the government honestly expect us to go out and buy new cars ... none of us have the capital to do that,'' said cabdriver <PERSON> Konstantinos </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefanides </PERSON>. A gallon of unleaded gasoline costs about $ 2.40, compared to about $ 1.00 for diesel fuel. `` If our cars were to run on -LRB- unleaded fuel -RRB-, we would have to raise our fares substantively,'' said <PERSON> Stefanides </PERSON>. `` It would be the end of some of the cheapest taxis in the world.'' A taxi ride from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to the city costs $ 4.

<HEAD>Court Allows Alaska Officials to Enforce Law on Political

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today allowed <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials to enforce a state law requiring groups of two or more people to report political campaign contributions. The court, citing a lack of a substantial federal question, rejected an appeal by an oil field service company fined $ 72,600 for not reporting paycheck withholding of $ 100 per worker and payment of the money to legislative candidates. The company, <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, collected $ 41,080 in campaign contributions by mid-December 1983. The money generally went to candidates picked by an oil and gas industry political action committee. <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> encouraged its employees to allow $ 100 to be withheld for donations. The workers could choose not to contribute or could earmark the money for specific candidates. The company was told by a state official in August 1983 that it would not have to register the withholding plan with the state or report the contributions. But the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that supervises the campaign reporting law later wrote to <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> indicating the company was not exempt from the act. The <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last April upheld the fine against <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION>. The state court said the contributions were provided by a group _ and not separate individuals _ since the company `` has a significant role in candidate selection.'' The state court also rejected arguments that the law is too broad because it imposes disclosure requirements on small groups that spend minor sums of money supporting candidates. `` There is a level of joint political activity below which the government has no legitimate interest in regulating,'' the state court said. But the state court said <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION>'s plan was above that level and there was no danger of chilling political activity by interpreting the law to apply to the plan. `` <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> furnished substantial support to candidates in the 1984 election,'' the state court said. `` The public was not informed of this support and to that extent the statutory purpose was frustrated.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, 88-177.

 Soviet claims against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for construction delays on its <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> embassy exceed the $ 29 million the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants for its unfinished embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, an official said today. `` We also have bills to present to the American side,'' <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told a news conference. Claims for late delivery of equipment and construction materials and other problems would top the sum <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are seeking from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday that he was recommending the main office building of the new <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> compound in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> be torn down because it is riddled with Soviet bugging devices.

The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claim is for damage and defective construction.

<HEAD>Court Kills Challenge to Nebraska Policy on Spanking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today killed a challenge to a <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> policy prohibiting facilities offering 24-hour care for children from using corporal punishment. The justices, citing a lack of a substantial federal question, let stand a <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision dismissing a challenge to the law by the <ORGANIZATION> Cornhusker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hitchcock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. Cornhusker, located on a 160-acre ranch, provides 24-hour residential care to children placed by parents, courts and the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The children attend public schools in <LOCATION> Culbertson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, and live in cottages in a family-type atmosphere with house parents. Up to 1983, Cornhusker had a written policy on discipline that permitted a house parent to use corporal punishment _ `` such as the spanking on the buttocks by the open hand or a suitable instrument for the purpose of inflicting temporary pain.'' But in 1983 state officials adopted a new policy, prohibiting such corporal punishment. Cornhusker amended its disciplinary policy under protest, and challenged the state's policy in court. At the time, 15 children ranging in age from 8 to 16 lived at the home. A state trial judge found the state regulation invalid on state law grounds. The <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last December reversed the trial judge's ruling and reinstated the state regulation barring corporal punishment at homes such as Cornhusker. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Cornhusker </ORGANIZATION> argued that the no-spanking state policy violates the rights of parents who entrust their children to such homes. `` The regulation is a remarkable state intrusion on a clear and oft-recognized parental liberty interest to control and direct the welfare of a child,'' the appeal said. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Cornhusker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> DDS, 87-2058.

<HEAD>Court Rules on Miranda Issue in Pennsylvania Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that police in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> did not violate the rights of a man suspected of drunken driving by failing to read the motorist his so-called Miranda warnings soon enough. The justices, by a 7-2 vote in an unsigned opinion, agreed with <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law enforcement officials that a lower court wrongly required police to warn motorists of their right against self-incrimination. Relying on a 1984 ruling, the court said that ordinarily when police stop a motorist they are not required to give the Miranda warnings because the motorist is not in custody. The motorist `` was not entitled to a recitation of his constitutional rights prior to arrest, and his roadside responses to questioning were admissible'' as evidence, the court said. Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> dissented. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was stopped in <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, the morning of Jan. 19, 1985, by a police officer who said <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> was driving erratically. The officer said <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> was swerving back and forth across the highway. He said that after stopping his car and emerging, <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> had difficulty maintaining his balance. The officer asked <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> if he had been drinking and <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> replied in the affirmative. The policeman also asked <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> to recite the alphabet, a task the officer said <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> performed poorly. After that, <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> was arrested and warned that he had a right to a lawyer, to remain silent and that anything he said could be held against him. A judge found him guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol and sentenced him to a term of 48 hours to six months in jail. A three-judge state court overturned the conviction last year, ruling that <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> was entitled to the Miranda warnings earlier. The state court said <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> was entitled to the warnings before being questioned by the police officer, even though he had not been arrested formally. <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> had good reason to believe he was not free to leave and, in effect, was in police custody when stopped, the state court said. `` The test of custodial interrogation is whether the individual being interrogated reasonably believes his freedom of action is being restricted,'' the state court said. `` Undoubtedly, -LRB- <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> -RRB- was not free to leave when he made the statements elicited.'' Also, the state court said, requiring <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> to recite the alphabet was akin to taking testimony from him, and should not occur before he was read his rights. The state court contrasted the recitation with taking a purely physical test for sobriety _ such as walking a straight line. `` We view the recitation of the alphabet as essentially communicative in nature,'' the state court said. It said <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON> could be retried, but his pre-Miranda statements and testimony about reciting the alphabet must be excluded. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law enforcement officials said the state court ruling violates a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that permitted police to question motorists without giving the Miranda warnings. The high court said in the 1984 case that the vast majority of roadside detentions last only a few minutes and are conducted in public. Generally, the court said then, the motorist feels he will be permitted to go on his way and is not completely at the mercy of the police. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> state court said the 1984 decision does not rule out the possibility that in some cases police, even prior to arrest, must warn motorists of their rights before questioning them. The case is <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Bruder </PERSON>, 88-161.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today allowed public school officials in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to ban leaflets and school yearbook advertisements that promoted a student-run, lunch-hour Bible study group. The court rejected an appeal by two students who said the officials violated their free-speech rights. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case. But the votes of at least four justices are required to grant such review. The students, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Perumal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON>, were barred by <LOCATION> Saddleback </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> school district officials during the 1984-85 school year from distributing the religious club flyers or placing ads in their high school yearbooks. <PERSON> Perumal </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and Read went to <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viejo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Saddleback </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> district. Officials allowed the students, members of a group called <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Life </LOCATION>, to run Bible study and prayer groups during lunch hour outside the school building. But the officials said permitting distribution of the handbills and yearbook ads would violate constitutionally required separation of church and state. The officials said permitting distribution of religious literature and advertisements, in effect, would be giving government backing to the Bible study group. The school district said it was acting in accord with a formal policy that limits the use of school facilities to officially approved student organizations and clubs. The officials noted that in 1981 the district withdrew recognition of the New Life group after some parents complained. But <PERSON> Perumal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Read </PERSON> said the school district was practicing unlawful censorship by restricting free expression about religion. A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> appeals court, in a 2-1 ruling in January, said the school officials acted properly. The appeals court said a school may decide to prohibit `` off-campus groups from functioning or advertising on campus.'' The appeals court also said the <LOCATION> Saddleback </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> policy permitting only school-sponsored activities to function complies with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s test for assuring separation of church and state. That three-part test permits government-sponsored activities that have a primary secular purpose, do not advance religion and do not cause entanglement between government and religion. The case is Perumal vs. <LOCATION> Saddleback </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, 88-340.

The newspaper said its temptation to endorse no one was overcome when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` displayed extraordinary weakness'' in choosing Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate. It also called the race `` one of the most trivial elections in recent memory'' pitting `` two candidates as notable for their weaknesses as their strengths.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked up endorsements Sunday from the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which said that `` after wiping away the mud from both candidates, The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> believes <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the better choice.'' The Eagle-Beacon, the largest newspaper in heavily <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION>, said in a Sunday editorial that the Democratic nominee `` seems uniquely prepared to deal with the crises certain to confront the next president.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` has shown much deeper sensitivity toward the struggles of millions of Americans to make ends meet,'' the newspaper said. Eagle-Beacon managing editor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Handy </PERSON> said it was the paper's first endorsement of a Democrat for president since The <ORGANIZATION> Wichita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> and The <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beacon </LOCATION> were formed in 1872 and the two papers merged into a morning edition in 1980. This year, the editorial board said it was disgusted with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s negative campaign tactics. `` I think it reveals the broad distaste that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, really both campaigns, has left in the mouth of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Neavoll </PERSON> said. `` Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has drawn criticism from his fellow Democrats because he has refused _ or has been unable _ to match the Republicans in meanspiritedness and contempt for the American voters,'' the newspaper said. The editorial also said that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has more than 20 years in public service, `` he has left his fingerprints on so few positive accomplishments.'' It also questioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, `` a feckless, shallow, politically immature man,'' as his vice presidential running mate. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the scales were tipped in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' favor as the candidate likely to do a better job of `` getting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> out of hock'' from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's deficits, which it called the most urgent task facing the next president. The vice president also was endorsed by the Sunday Oregonian of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, that state's largest newspaper; the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and five smaller <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> newspapers, as well as the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> -RRB- Capital-Journal, the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Sunday Telegram of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and The Blade of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the endorsement of The <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- News-Journal, the <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- Democrat and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s two largest papers, The Courier-Journal of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Lexington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Leader </ORGANIZATION>, as well as the <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World News. The <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Pioneer Press Dispatch endorsed both candidates, saying its editorial board was divided on which candidate would make the better president. The Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as best equipped to turn the nation's attention to long-neglected domestic needs. The paper criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` smear campaign'' and his `` alarming'' choice of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as a running mate. The <ORGANIZATION> Cedar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapids </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, the second largest paper in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, backed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his promise of no new taxes and his support for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and the Star Wars plan for a space-based missile defense system.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>, a hotbed of labor activism where strikes eight years ago gave rise to the Solidarity trade union movement, will be closed Dec. 1 because it is losing money, the government said today. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, an electrician at the shipyard, said workers were ready to take over the business and run it profitably. The shipyard was closed today because of a holiday and is to reopen Wednesday. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> called the decision a `` personal provocation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> against the birthplace of Solidarity.'' The shipyard is the first big industrial enterprise to be singled out for closure by the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, who promised to aggressively restructure Polish industry. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> was a firm supporter of the Dec. 13, 1981, martial law crackdown that crushed Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first free trade union. He was named prime minister Sept. 27 to replace <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, who was criticized as ineffectual in reforming the inefficient and debt-ridden economy. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said the move `` has nothing to do with Solidarity.'' In a radio interview with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` If someone wants to make the Polish economy more healthy, he has to start with very strong steps.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, in a statement released by an aide, said, `` Solidarity will defend the enterprise which is _ for the union and for the whole nation _ a symbol of the struggle for a new and better <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' The government's move comes as it bickers with Solidarity over proposed talks on social and economic reforms, including legalization of Solidarity. After <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> persuaded workers in August to end a wave of nationwide strikes, authorities said they would sit down with the opposition to discuss grievances. But officials object to Solidarity's choice of negotiators. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> approved the decision to close the shipyard Saturday. It referred to a speech he made Oct. 13 when he presented his government to the Parliament: `` <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> announced that his government will go from words and plans to firm acts which would recover the Polish economy. `` That would include liquidation of enterprises that are inefficient, unproductive and some enterprises which require subsidies from the state treasury,'' the agency said. The shipyard's workers will be offered jobs at other enterprises in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> province, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the 10,000 workers will have some 30,000 jobs to choose from. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the announcement of the closure `` is not a surprise for public opinion or for the work force of the Lenin shipyard. The possibility of liquidating this shipyard has been discussed in public ... for a long time.'' The shipyard, scene of strikes in May and August, has for two decades been a center of union activity but has been in decline for years. It was scheduled to build 11 ships this year, primarily for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which as an ally is afforded very favorable purchase terms. In the late 1970s, it produced a high of 27 ships a year and had more than 15,000 employees. One newspaper described it as a `` a giant on partly rotten legs.'' But the shipyard's director of foreign trade, <PERSON> Ireneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubiczek </PERSON>, said in July that the business was not necessarily unprofitable and its main problem was a lack of work force to handle all the potential contracts. In August 1980, a strike at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> gave rise to Solidarity. Solidarity's membership grew to 10 million before it was banned in 1982. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the union could cope with the yard's problem if given the chance. `` We are ready to take over this enterprise and make it profitable. We will help the -LRB- workers' council -RRB- take it over so that the shipyard can work well and make its profits,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he saw the announcement, which came during the four-day All Saints' Day holiday when Poles remember their dead, as an attempt by the government to provoke protests at the shipyards and in other factories. There were no immediate announcements of protests, but the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> a few blocks from the shipyard's gates, said he would celebrate Masses for the shipyard workers every night this week, culminating with a Mass on Sunday. Liquidating the shipyard's property will take at least one year, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. Production equipment not taken over by neighboring shipyards will be converted to different uses, it said. The liquidation program assumes completing construction of those ships already begun, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. Remaining contracts outstanding will be passed to other shipyards, it said. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s government has signaled on several occasions that it would move briskly to shut down money-losing enterprises that drain huge subsidies from the state. Industry Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilczek </PERSON> said last week he has asked his ministry staff to make a list of the country's 150 least efficient enterprises for possible closure.

<NOTE>EDs: Inserts grafs 16-30, In other action, with other cases</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed today to consider reviving an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to limit the president's authority to withhold classified information from the nation's legislative branch. The court said it will review a ruling that invalidated a law aimed at giving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> more access to national security information. The justices are expected to announce their decision in 1989. A federal judge had ruled the law violates the required separation of legislative and executive powers. The clash between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president over classified information is a longstanding one. But the case acted on today has more recent origins in a national security directive adopted by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 983. The directive requires federal officials, before they are allowed access to classified information, to sign an agreement that they will not disclose the information. The directive also established a standard form for officials to sign, promising they never will divulge classified or `` classifiable'' information without written permission from proper authorities. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> bridled at the directive, particularly the use of the word `` classifiable.'' They said the presidential order restricts the free-speech rights of federal employees and `` allows after-the-fact classification of information in order to punish whistleblowers for making disclosures that embarrass their superiors.'' Opponents of the presidential directive said the secrecy agreement that federal employees were forced to sign would bar them for life from revealing information to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> which it is entitled to receive. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> then enacted legislation prohibiting use of funds during the 1987-88 fiscal year to implement the standard forms <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had authorized. The legislation, attached to a general government spending bill, was aimed at blocking the executive branch from withholding `` classifiable'' information or from impeding congressional access to such material. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> declared the legislation unconstitutional last May. `` The statute impermissibly restricts the president's power to fulfill obligations imposed upon him by his express constitutional powers and the role of the executive in foreign relations,'' <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> said. In other action today, the court: _ Agreed to decide whether states must continue to provide lawyers for indigent death row inmates after they have lost their initial round of appeals. The court said it will hear an appeal by <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> officials who said requiring states to pay for attorneys in such cases could lead to interminable delays in carrying out executions. _ Killed a lawsuit against the government stemming from the World War II mass detention of Japanese-Americans in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prison camps. The court, without comment, left intact rulings that the veterans of the internment camps waited too long to file suit seeking compensation for property losses. _ Rejected an appeal by <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> prosecutors challenging state laws that broadly justify using deadly force to defend someone's home or personal property The justices, without comment, let stand <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> laws that permit use of deadly force even by people not threatened with death or great bodily harm. _ Let stand a ruling that a state may ban the possession of child pornography. The court, citing a lack of jurisdiction, rejected an appeal by an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> couple who say state officials are intruding into the privacy of the home to impose censorship. _ Declined to further expand its study of drug testing in the workplace, rejecting an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees who say such tests would violate their rights. The court, without comment, refused to intercede in the case, which has yet to be argued before a lower court. _ Ruled that police in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> did not violate the rights of a man suspected of drunken dirving by failing to read the motorist his so-called Miranda warnings soon enough. The justices, by a 7-2 vote in an unsigned opinion, agreed with <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law enforcement officials that a lower court wrongly required police to warn motorists of their right against self-incrimination. _ Allowed public school officials in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to ban leaflets and school yearbook advertisements that promoted a student-run, lunch-hour Bible study group. The court rejected an appeal by two students who said the officials violated their free-speech rights. In the classified-information case, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, representing members of the nation's diplomatic corps, joined with senators and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members from both political parties in appealing to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate the law. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration defended <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON>'s ruling. `` Surely the First Amendment does not confer an unfettered right on an employee of the executive branch to disclose whatever national security information he pleases outside authorized channels, whether to a member of the public or to a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The law that <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> threw out expired on Sept. 30 with the end of the fiscal year. But a similar rider was attached to the spending bill enacted for the current fiscal year. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced Wednesday that he was pocket-vetoing another measure intended to give new protection to federal employees who expose government fraud and abuse. The president said the bill, which is not tied directly to the case acted on by the court today, violates the Constitution. Since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has adjourned, it can not vote to override the veto. The case is <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Garfinkel </PERSON>, 87-2127.

<HEAD>Woman Dies After Getting Dead Daughter's Kidney In Transplant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman died two days after a transplant operation in which she received the kidney of her daughter who had died in a car accident, hospital officials said today. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION> died Sunday evening. On Friday, doctors had given her the kidney of her 26-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, following the daughter's death from injuries suffered in a car wreck earlier in the week. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> had suffered from kidney problems for seven years, and had needed dialysis, a mechanical method of cleansing the blood, for the last few months. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said an autopsy was being performed today to determine the cause of Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s death. He said Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> did return to the operating room earlier Sunday because of excessive bleeding. But there was no immediate word from doctors on how the death might have been related to any post-operative problems. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, had said that he had mixed emotions about the transplanting of his daughter's kidney into his ailing wife. `` I just tell myself that I'm doing what my daughter would have wanted,'' he said. The daughter was pronounced dead Thursday afternoon at a <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION> hospital following a roadway accident Tuesday. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said the daughter recently told her family that she wanted to become an organ donor, so her family followed her wishes. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said his wife knew before the surgery that she was receiving her daughter's kidney. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> had previously turned down her healthy 32-year-old son's offer to donate one of his kidneys because of the threat to his life that might occur if his other kidney failed. Black had said that Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s other kidney was designated for transplanting into a recipient in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.

 Academy award-winning actress <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> and her family were soaked with jet fuel but escaped unhurt when their private plane aborted takeoff and smashed into two parked airplanes. `` It's absolutely a miracle'' no one was seriously injured in Saturday's crash, said <LOCATION> Pitkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> operations manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frome </PERSON>. `` We're very, very fortunate that it's our slow period.'' Field, 41, was en route to <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, when the Challenger CL60 crashed. Also on board were her film producer husband, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greisman </PERSON>, 41, her 11-month-old son, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, and mother, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Mahoney </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Pitkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>. The pilot and co-pilot were treated for cuts and bruises, <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> said. A flight attendant on the jet was unhurt. `` I led them from the crash to the terminal building, and I think she -LRB- Field -RRB- was in a state of semi-shock,'' said <PERSON> Frome </PERSON>. `` She did n't know what had happened. `` The gas was just spurting out of the gas tanks,'' said Miss Field's publicist, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON>. `` They were covered with gas. They had to get out of the plane and they got out on the wing and had to jump about six feet to the ground.'' <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumsden </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pitkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the plane lost power as it attempted takeoff, causing it to veer to the right. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the crash. The private jet had been loaned to Miss Field, who owns a home overlooking <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>, by producer and former talk-show host <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, the owner, according to <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> publicist, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts from the videotaped messages received from American hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> since his abduction March 16, 1985: _ Oct 4, 1986, after the release from Soviet custody of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON>: After 2 -LCB- years of empty of empty talks and refusals to act on the part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, it hurt to see the propaganda and bombast with which that administration solved the problem of Mr. <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON>, a citizen like us who was imprisoned only a short time. How can any official justify the interest, attention and action given in that case and the inattention given ours? We are surprised that the American government has put pressure on other Arab and European governments not to negotiate in such cases as ours, but surrendered itself on the <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON> case, releasing the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> spy -LRB- <PERSON> Gennadiy </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Zakharov </PERSON> who was working against our people. _ Dec 24, 1987: To my government, I do n't know what to say. To my family, I love you and miss you very much. ... I am in good health but tired and very lonely. Mr. President, I say again this can not continue. There is a limit for how long we can last and some of us are approaching their limit. ... Surely by now you know what must be done and how you can do it. This is difficult, but you can do it. There have been enough careful consideration, cold discussion and enough secret maneuvering.'' I know that you're trying to get us out though I do n't know exactly what it is you've been doing. I only know that it has n't been enough or the right thing _ Oct 31, 1988, following his 41st birthday: I'm well and being well treated. I received your birthday greetings and as always that helped me very much. But as my fourth birthday in captivity passes and as the end of my fourth year -LRB- in captivity -RRB- approaches, I find it difficult to keep my hopes and my courage high. I've been very close to being released several times ... But each time it seems that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government uses its influence to stop any agreement ... I do n't understand this. I gather there's been very little discussion about this problem in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential campaign and that's disappointing, as is President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s complete failure to find a solution during his eight years in office. I heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious effort to free three trapped whales a few days ago and the president's thanks to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for its help ... That kind of cooperation and spirit is absolutely necessary to bring this situation to an end. Once again, this has gone on too long. It ca n't continue like this.

 Two Swedish tourists who had been stabbed and shot to death were found at the bottom of a cliff on an <LOCATION> Inca </LOCATION> trail in the Andes, the Swedish Consulate said today. <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON> <PERSON> Arduz </PERSON>, the Swedish consul in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, identified the victims as <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsdotter-Liedegren </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Barbro </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwang </PERSON>, 20.

Because of the rugged terrain, police said they were having problems retrieving the bodies. Police found a sleeping bag with a diary and documents belonging to the two Swedes near the cliff where the bodies were found. <PERSON> Arduz </PERSON> said the Swedes were experienced travelers who planned on crossing the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> basin after leaving <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Doomed Plane's Pilot Says He Hesitated Too Long</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The pilot of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 told investigators he wishes he had applied full power immediately after the first sign of trouble and not 23 seconds later as his <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 was about to crash, documents revealed today. The crash Aug. 31 at the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas-Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> claimed 14 lives. There were 108 people aboard the jet, bound for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A transcript of the cockpit voice recorder tape, among the eight sets of documents released by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, showed a routine takeoff down the runway with the plane gaining proper speed and climbing power. Seconds after liftoff, however, there was the sound of a `` snap'' and then the jet's control column began to shake, an advance warning that the aircraft was about to stall. `` Something's wrong,'' Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who was at the controls, was believed to have said. His exact words were not clear. Then followed the sounds of what is believed to be five compressor stalls in the engines and the co-pilot announcing an `` engine failure.'' Investigators have said they have found no evidence of a mechanical malfunction in any of the three engines. `` We're not gon na to make it,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said nearly 15 seconds after the first `` snap'' was heard. But it was eight seconds more before he called for `` full power,'' according to the transcript. Less than a second later came the sound of the first impact. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said in interviews with <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators that `` in retrospect I should have pushed up full power immediately,'' according to a separate document made public today by the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>. During the interview, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> also said that he was aware his aircraft had an unusually high nose-up position as it struggled to gain lift, but that he was afraid to lower the nose, the normal maneuver in an attempt to fly out of a stall, because he thought impact with the ground was imminent. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said that in the seconds after liftoff the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 began to `` roll violently.'' He told investigators, `` It was all I could do to control the airplane.'' He said at one point he thought `` we were going to make it, but then we got more bangs.'' Investigators have closely examined the three engines of the jetliner and concluded that there was no mechanical failure. The bangs have been widely interpreted as the compressor stalls caused by an interruption of air flow, possibly because of an unusual angle of the aircraft. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> previously has said that there is evidence the plane's flaps might not have been extended properly for takeoff, which would have inhibited the plane's ability to gain lift The flaps were found in a retracted position in the wreckage, as was the cockpit lever controlling the flaps. But the transcript of the cockpit voice recorder tape released today indicates, as has been disclosed previously, that the flight crew followed a pre-takeoff checklist that included specific reference to the flap setting. `` Flaps,'' the flight engineer, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, was heard to say. `` Fifteen, fifteen, green light,'' responded the co-pilot, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>. The numbers were a reference to the degree of extension for the flaps on the left and right wings. `` Green light'' referred to an indicator light denoting the position of the wing slats, which also must be extended in a takeoff.

<HEAD>Walesa Vows to Fight Lenin Shipyard Closure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An infuriated <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> vowed Monday to fight government plans to close down the Lenin shipyard, the site where the Solidarity trade union was born. The state-owned shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> is being closed down Dec. 1. It is the first big industrial plant to be singled out for closure by the month-old government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>. The decision was announced while the shipyard was closed on the eve of All Saints' Day and caught many workers and Solidarity activists by surprise. The yard reopens Wednesday. A longtime foe of Solidarity, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> took office Sept. 27 with a pledge to restructure <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s aging industrial base and get the economy moving. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>, he said the decision `` has nothing to do with Solidarity.'' The announcement came during an impasse in preparations for talks between representatives of Solidarity and the government, which had been promised to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Aug. 31 during the last strike at the shipyard. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> denounced the decision as <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s `` personal provocation ... against the birthplace of Solidarity.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> was a firm supporter of the Dec. 13, 1981, martial-law crackdown on Solidarity. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, himself a worker at the shipyard, said in a later statement that `` Solidarity will defend the enterprise which is for the union and for the whole nation a symbol of the struggle for a new and better <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> on Saturday approved an <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minstry </ORGANIZATION> recommendation to close the yard. It referred to the premier's Oct. 13 speech when he presented his plan to parliament. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> that `` there is no other way. If someone wants to make the Polish economy more healthy, he has to start with very strong steps.'' `` <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> announced that his government will go from words and plans to firm acts which would recover the Polish economy,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. `` That would include liquidation of enterprises that are inefficient, unproductive and some enterprises which require subsidies from the state treasury.'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> added the decision should come as no surprise because the possibility has been discussed publicly `` for a long time.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> replaced Prime Minister <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, who was criticized as ineffectual in reforming <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s inefficient and debt-ridden economy. Since taking over, he has announced cuts in several government departments and allowed several independent groups to be legalized. But closing the <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> yard is his first move to streamline <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s heavy industry The century-old shipyard, the scene of strikes in May and August, employs about 10,000 workers and was scheduled to build 11 ships this year. It constructs ships primarily for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for non-convertible currency. Articles in the press have questioned its financial efficacy, with one newspaper describing the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> `` as a giant on partly rotten legs.'' A strike at the shipyard in August 1980 gave rise to Solidarity, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent trade union whose membership grew to 10 million before the union was banned in October 1982. But the yard has been in decline for more than a decade. In the late 1970s, it produced a high of 27 ships one year. At that time, its employment was more than 15,000. In July, the yard's director of foreign trade, <PERSON> Ireneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubiczek </PERSON>, said the yard was not necessarily unprofitable and said its chief problem was a lack of workforce to handle all its potential contracts. He said whether it was profitable or not was debatable, since it all depended on the costs arbitrarily set by the state for materials, taxes and credit. But management admitted it needed new loans or subsidies in order to continue production. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said his union could cope with the yard's financial problem if given the chance. `` We are ready to take over this enterprise and make it profitable. We will help the -LRB- workers' council -RRB- take it over so that the shipyard can work well and make its profits,'' he said. He said he saw the announcement as an attempt by the government to provoke protests at the shipyards and in other factories. The Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, pastor of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brygida </LOCATION>'s Church near the shipyard's gates, said he would celebrate Masses for shipyard workers every night this week, culminating with a big Mass on Sunday. But there were no immediate plans for protest actions. `` We will have to work out a general stand for the union,'' said <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lis </PERSON>, Solidarity regional leader in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. `` I think that it could lead to a new strike.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> last week refused to meet with Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> about a government demand he drop two proposed Solidarity delegates to the talks whom the government considers too extreme. On Friday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> plans to visit the towering Solidarity monument just outside the shipyard gates. The <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> communique said the shipyard's workers would be offered jobs at other enterprises in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> province. It said the 10,000 workers will have 30,000 jobs to choose from. Liquidating the shipyard's property will take at least a year, the communique said. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s government has signaled on several occasions it would move briskly to shut down money-losing enterprises that are a drain on the state. `` Perhaps fewer and fewer shipyards would make for more efficient shipyards,'' newly appointed Industry Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilczek </PERSON> told a news conference last week. <PERSON> Wilczek </PERSON> said he has asked for a list of the country's 150 least-efficient enterprises for possible closure.

 Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today mocked <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' sudden embrace of the liberal label as a `` breakthrough'' and dismissed his Democratic rival's invitation to an election-eve debate next Monday night. The vice president said the real debate should feature <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` the new left vs. the old left.'' A combative <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his declaration that `` Yes, I'm a liberal'' during a campaign swing Sunday through <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and a new poll showed the vice president with a 15-point lead over the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. The survey, taken last week by The <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a 53 percent to 38 percent advantage in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, a dramatic gain from his two-point lead around Labor Day. Nine electoral votes are at stake in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, where the Bush-Dukakis battle originally was predicted to be close. After weeks of trying to avoid the liberal label that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly sought to paste on him, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> suddenly wore it proudly Sunday. `` I'm a liberal in the tradition of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wasted no time in responding today at his first rally of a campaign day that also will take him to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mo </PERSON>. `` Now for the breakthrough,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled that during their last nationally broadcast debate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Oct. 13, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` jumped all over me for using the L word. Well, speaking of my opponent, yesterday, miracle of miracles, headlines, read all about it, he's using the liberal label again.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had challenged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to a one-hour debate the night before the Nov. 8 balloting to talk about `` what it takes to lead this country and unite this country.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chimed in with a counter-proposal. `` There should be a debate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, an entertaining debate, the new left vs. the old left.'' He added: `` The governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> could suddenly pretend to be in the tradition that is prepared to use force to defend freedom, but then the other governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> could explain why he failed to support that needed military action in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> or the action against that terrorist, <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, and why he has opposed every weapon system to modernize our defense. What a debate.'' `` One could claim to be on the side of ordinary Americans and the other <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could explain why he thinks ordinary Americans oppose the death penalty for drug kingpins like he does, favor these weekend furloughs for first-degree murderers who have not served enough time to be eligible for parole,' and oppose a law that would require teachers to lead their classes in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' he said. `` What a debate. It should be very, very interesting.'' As the crowd applauded, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> concluded, `` Will the real liberal please stand up? God knows what would happen.'' Campaigning in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he did n't believe recent polls indicating that his lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is narrowing. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead had shrunk to six percentage points, but <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> aides said it had settled in the double-digit range after some fluctuations. A new Time magazine poll of 1,096 probable voters showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading by 10 percentage points, 50 percent to 40 percent. The survey was conducted Tuesday and Wednesday and results had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. His schedule later in the week tentatively calls for him to hit <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking to supporters outside the campaign's headquarters in suburban <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, encouraged voters to go to the polls on Election Day. `` From now on it's get out that vote. As for <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and me, we're going to keep running like we're 10 points behind. Nobody is going to out-work us,'' he told the gathering. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, said campaign officials had always expected to see the poll numbers tighten and were not alarmed by the latest apparent shift toward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I think it's to be expected as you get to the final days of the campaign that you're going to see some tightening in this race, but that's going to cause us to work harder. We'll not allow ourselves to lose the edge we've had as a campaign team,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> repudiated a Republican campaign flier circulating in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> with side-by-side photographs of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a convicted murderer who raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman and slashed her fiance after he escaped while on a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally responsible for the fund-raising letter which asks, `` Is this your pro-family team for 1988?'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, appearing on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation,'' said the flier was `` totally out of bounds and totally unauthorized.'' But he said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign could do nothing about it. `` You can not control every party organization throughout the country,'' he said.

 One law used to imprison Soviet political dissidents will be rescinded and another likely will be revised to cover specific acts against the state, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today. It was the second promise within a week of impending improvements for Soviet dissidents. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said last week after talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with officials including Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that he had been told all people regarded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as political prisoners will be freed by the end of the year. On Monday, Justice Minister <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravtsov </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that Article 190, the law banning `` anti-Soviet slander,'' apparently will be dropped in the current review of the Soviet criminal code. Article 70, barring `` anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda,'' probably will be restricted to cover concrete actions, <PERSON> Kravtsov </PERSON> said. He also said the law on exit visas is being revised in accordance with an international agreement on civil and political rights. <PERSON> Kravtsov </PERSON> said only eight people are serving sentences under the two anti-dissent laws. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights organization, says it has information on 150 Soviets `` imprisoned soley for their non-violent exercise of their fundamental human rights.''

 Students enrolling in a new course at the <ORGANIZATION> Whitaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theology </ORGANIZATION> may find their names on a police rap sheet. The seven-month introductory course on religious protest will include demonstrations outside Detroit-area military contractors such as <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Walled </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, said the instructor, the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie-Kellerman </PERSON>. Candidates for the priesthood in the Episcopal Diocese of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which sponsors the school, will earn seminary credit for the course, which begins Saturday. `` It is important to understand that worship and liturgy are always political,'' said <PERSON> Wylie-Kellerman </PERSON>, 39, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> who has been jailed nearly 40 times during protests at military and weapons facilities in several states. <PERSON> Wylie-Kellerman </PERSON> said the protests to be staged as part of his course will be `` a low-risk taste of this kind of direct action.'' Students will be asked to pray and read Bible passages and not necessarily be arrested, he said. He said the course was meant to clarify the relationships among politics, religion and militarism. `` There is a spiritual conflict over the culture of militarism,'' he said. `` On one side there's a story of imperial <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, its manifest destiny and Rambo and ` Make my day.' There's a whole language and story about imperial <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is living out.

CLASSIFIED INFORMATION The Court agreed to consider reviving an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to limit the president's authority to withhold classified information from the nation's legislative branch. The court said it will review a ruling that invalidated a law aimed at giving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> more access to national security information. The case is <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Garfinkel </PERSON>, 87-2127. DEATH ROW The court agreed to decide whether states must continue to provide lawyers for indigent death row inmates after they have lost their initial round of appeals. The court said it will hear an appeal by <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> officials who said requiring states to pay for attorneys in such cases could lead to interminable delays in carrying out executions. The case is <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Giarrantano </PERSON>, 88-411. JAPANESE INTERNMENT The court killed a lawsuit against the government stemming from the World War II mass detention of Japanese-Americans in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prison camps.

The case is <PERSON> Hohri </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-215. DEADLY FORCE The court rejected an appeal by <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> prosecutors challenging state laws that broadly justify using deadly force to defend someone's home or personal property.

<TEXT>
 H.D. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a local retired judge, says Democrat <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowdy </PERSON> has a winning combination in his uphill Senate race against Republican <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>: `` We got the old folks, the rednecks and the blacks, and there ai n't nothing in this state can beat it.'' That observation may contain a bit of bravado, for Dowdy trails <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> by eight percentage points in the latest statewide poll. But it also expresses a belief that politics in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> have n't changed as much as <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> would like to think The schism in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> politics along racial and economic lines remains real. But <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, the smooth, buttoned-down politician who has risen to the No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership position in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, believes the balance is changing. `` <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowdy </PERSON> is a good ol' boy, and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is getting away from good ol' boys,'' <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> said last week in <LOCATION> Clarksdale </LOCATION>, the hub of cotton-growing Delta country. `` People perceive him as a backbencher. They see me as somebody who rose to a leadership position.'' In his three House terms, <PERSON> Dowdy </PERSON> took an active role in supporting renewal of the Voting Rights Act, but otherwise has not left a great legislative imprint. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s electorate is about one-third black and substantially rural. The state, long the nation's poorest, has made major economic strides in the past two decades. There are growing numbers of young professionals who live mostly along the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, the capital city, and they are overwhelmingly Republican. The challenge for Dowdy, 45, is to get the maximum turnout by blacks, who he believes will cast 90 percent or more of their votes for him, and to grab about one of every three white voters. Dowdy concedes that will be difficult, but says he has a reputation as a come-from-behind campaigner and that pollsters miss many of his supporters who do n't have telephones. On that night in <LOCATION> Clarksdale </LOCATION>, the joint appearance by the two candidates battling for the seat of retiring Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>, D-Miss., reflected their philosophical differences Addressing a pro-Lott <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> crowd of 300 people, <PERSON> Dowdy </PERSON> made a pitch for better roads and schools, two areas where he said the federal government should play a greater role. <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> countered that the answer to the state's problems is economic development. `` The answer is the private sector,'' <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> said. He called for a cut in the capital gains tax rate, which is one of Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s favorite campaign themes. Ironically, <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> received the heartiest applause of the evening when he specifically urged widening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 61, a worn, north-south artery through the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, from two to four lanes. For Dowdy and his supporters, such moments are frustrating. They say that <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, 47, has built an eight-term congressional career on pinching pennies _ including funds for his own state _ but is using slick advertising to avoid paying the political price for those past votes. Although he campaigns for road improvements, <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> has voted against transportation appropriations bills in the House. A television ad shows him canoeing through the wilderness, though an environmental group has listed him among `` the dirty dozen'' in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with the worst environmental voting records. <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> claims to be among the staunchest defenders of Social Security, but does not mention his 1981 vote to eliminate the minimum benefit. <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>'s TV ads are produced by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, who made the `` Morning in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' spots for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984, and they have been effective in softening the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate's cool partisan edge. `` Sometimes I get that Teflon feeling,'' says Dowdy supporter <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s famed ability to shed political negatives. `` We have not educated the people on what <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>'s votes really are.'' <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> stumps from town to town before crowds turned out by a well-oiled campaign machine. Dowdy's efforts seem more haphazard as he makes unannounced visits to courthouses and local businesses. <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> seems to have generated enthusiasm in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, where his campaign posters have sprouted in the yards of white, middle-class neighborhoods. The same signs are prominent along the main drags of smaller towns, too. Dowdy, a country lawyer from <PERSON> McComb </PERSON> who became wealthy enough to buy several radio stations, seems unconcerned. `` We do n't get the Main Street crowd,'' he says. Although he has outspent Dowdy by $ 2.6 million to $ 1.6 million, <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> has never broken much above 50 percent in the polls, which gives the Democratic candidate some comfort. Dowdy has gone on the air with his own ads, one of which features an endorsement by the widely revered <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>. `` In the end, it's going to be decided among independent voters as to likability,'' Dowdy said. One of Dowdy's big frustrations is having a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, at the top of his party's national ticket. It is hard to imagine two states more different culturally than <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. When asked about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dowdy </PERSON> prefers to talk instead about Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the vice presidential candidate. `` We are not running from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but his campaign is not doing that well in our state,'' Dowdy observes. He predicts that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is running more than 20 points ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, will help <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> by several percentage points.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> quietly cast off the shadow of a dynamic predecessor during his first year in office, but now faces two major tests: a political scandal and the approaching death of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is undynamic even by Japanese political standards. He minimizes conflicts by seldom speaking out, and waits until a consensus has formed before making political moves. His approach is a sharp contrast to the flamboyant self-confidence of his predecessor, <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, who became one of the few Japanese political leaders with a strong image abroad. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s approach `` is a return to the traditional Japanese political style,'' says <PERSON> Yozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yokota </PERSON>, professor of international law at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> was outward-looking, but not so good at gathering support within the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is the reverse. He spends time listening to various views in the party and then seeks a consensus. He does n't have his own policies or philosophy.'' During his first year as prime minister _ Thursday is the anniversary _ <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has weathered two political crises, announced an expansion of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s diplomatic activities, dealt with two major trade disputes and presided over a vigorous economic recovery. Now, however, the 64-year-old leader faces a growing stock-trading scandal involving top politicians and the inevitable death of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who has been gravely ill since September. The trading scandal involves shares in the Recruit-Cosmos real estate company reportedly sold at low prices to dozens of prominent politicians, business leaders and journalists before the stock was publicly traded. When public trading began, the value of the shares shot upward and the recipients made large profits. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> and other top officials acknowledged some aides bought <ORGANIZATION> Recuit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares, but said they did not know about it. Government officials have said the transactions were legal but opposition parties claim they were unethical and have demanded a parliamentary investigation. If <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s a parliament, the Diet, investigates the stock scandal, one test of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s command will be whether he can prevent it from spreading into other areas of political financing. `` There are a lot more disclosures to come,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, professor of Japanese studies at <ORGANIZATION> Sophia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The approaching death of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, 87, is an emotional issue for the nation. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has not experienced the death of an emperor under its postwar constitution, which separates religion and the state. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s government must decide how to handle the many traditional Shinto-based funeral and related ceremonies. Some Japanese continue to link the imperial system with rightist politics and militarism, and see the transition as a critical period. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> used adroit behind-the-scenes dealings and great skill at manipulating the party bureaucracy to work his way up through the ranks, and became leader of the largest faction of the governing Liberal Democrats in 1987. While <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> often tried to circumvent government and party structures by establishing special study commissions and advisory groups, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has reaffirmed the role of bureaucrats, with whom he feels comfortable. On <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for access to the Japanese public works construction market, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> gave complete negotiating authority to <PERSON> Ichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozawa </PERSON>, deputy chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary. The dispute, which dragged on for more than 1 -LCB- years and came to symbolize trade differences between the two nations, was settled in March with concessions from powerful Japanese industry groups. He also delegated negotiating power in talks on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> eliminate import restrictions on beef and oranges. Trade friction has declined during <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s tenure because of slower growth in exports attributable to the yen's higher value. In two crises during his first year in office, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> took little direct action, allowing both to run their course until the people involved resigned. One concerned <PERSON> Seisuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, who caused protests from abroad by saying that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was not the aggressor in World War II. The other involved <PERSON> Koichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamada </PERSON>, head of the powerful lower house <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, who called an opposition politician a murderer. In foreign policy, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was widely expected to remain under the influence of <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, who took a special interest in the field. Instead, he has traveled widely to build his own international reputation, including trips to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In June, at the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> summit of Western leaders, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> pledged that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would expand its international political and diplomatic role and increase foreign aid over five years to the equivalent of $ 50 billion, which would make it the world's largest donor.

 Former Philippine first lady <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent to racketeering charges today, but a federal judge refused to let her return to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> until government and defense lawyers iron out details of her $ 5 million bail. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> brushed away a tear as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> said, `` I'm not going to let the lady go back to the <LOCATION> Hawaiian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> until I'm certain the bail is set.'' He set another hearing for Thursday. She and her entourage arrived Sunday by borrowed luxury jet from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where she and ousted <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> have lived in exile since fleeing their homeland in February 1986. They are accused of embezzling $ 100 million from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Defense lawyers had convinced <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> that the 71-year-old <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was too frail to make the trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for a court appearance. His arraignment was postponed, at least until a government physician examines him. The judge, however, ordered Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 59, to appear on the charges that she and her husband used the country's money to buy property including four <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> buildings and artwork. As a small group of demonstrators changed anti-Marcos slogans, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> strode into court dressed in black high-heeled pumps and an aqua-blue, off-the-shoulder full-length gown with puffy sleeves. She spoke only twice during the 45-minute hearing, once to waive a reading of the indictment, and once to answer `` Not guilty.'' After the innocent plea was entered, the judge set bail to be secured by real estate, cash and personal possessions `` amounting to a reasonable market value of $ 5 million.'' The judge first said he would not detain Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, but a hitch developed when prosecutors and defense lawyers could not agree on what property and cash would be used to secure the bail. Defense lawyers, who originally wanted Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> released without any bail, had agreed to a bail package in which the Marcoses would put up $ 1.2 million in Philippine pesos along with jewelry the couple brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when they fled their homeland. `` I do n't see how that can possibly be used as bail,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON>, noting that the jewelry is subject to subpoena in an ongoing grand jury investigation and the Philippine currency is subject to a claim by the current government of that nation. The judge ordered the parties to return to court Thursday with details on bail. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was then sent to be fingerprinted. The embezzlement and racketeering indictment was handed up Oct. 21. The main racketeering charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison upon conviction. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> flew from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> on Saturday, the first time she has left the state since her exile there. On Sunday, a limousine brought her to the <ORGANIZATION> Waldorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towers </ORGANIZATION>, one of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> locations where she threw lavish parties as first lady. She was surrounded by reporters and photographers. Bodyguards cleared a path as she and those with her strode inside the luxury apartment-hotel without comment. A <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> associate in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> hoped to shop and entertain old friends while in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Her real concern is that she also has n't left her husband's side for three years and she's very concerned about his health,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> attorney, said in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> `` She's going to meet her legal obligation, but I just do n't see her having a gay old time in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' Sunday afternoon, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> visited <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s Roman Catholic Cathedral. Aides said the <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION> bill, which reportedly will run $ 1,800 a night, is to be paid by friends they wo n't identify The criminal indictment is similar to a 1986 civil lawsuit filed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by the Philippine government of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' successor, <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` We developed an idea, which the American courts bought, that a dictator ca n't fleece his country, deposit the loot in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and expect to get away with it,'' said <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavis </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit legal group representing the Aquino government. In response to the lawsuit, an injunction was granted March 2, 1986, that prevented the sale or transfer of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> properties, which included four <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> commercial buildings and a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> estate, with a total value reportedly in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> arrived Sunday in a private <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 loaned by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> heiress <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. The plane, outfitted to carry just 19, brought Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' entourage, which included an attorney, a nurse, secretary and several friends. The jet landed at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where reporters and about 40 supporters remained behind a gate out of sight from Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` We wanted to show Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> that there are Filipinos who still support them,'' said <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Paderon </PERSON>. `` I hope they will be vindicated of all these politically motivated charges that are coming left and right. `` They -LRB- the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government -RRB- double-crossed the president. You do n't do that to friends. It's going to cost the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' Six others were indicted with the Marcoses, including Saudi financier <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, who is accused of acting as a front for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to help divert assets and hide his ownership of real estate and art.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knew the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> secretly sold weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an effort to secure freedom for American hostages, but he was unaware, he says, that profits from the sales were later diverted to the Nicaraguan Contras. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was chief of a presidential task force on terrorism, has tried to minimize his involvement in the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sale. He has said `` mistakes were made,'' but claimed he was `` out of the loop'' in making major policy decisions. The congressional committees that investigated the Iran-Contra affair said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was present at a White House meeting on Aug. 6, 1985, at which participants talked about allowing the Israelis to sell U.S.-made missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made no decision on the weapons sales, participants said. But Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and former Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> opposed the plan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has steadfastly refused to reveal his recommendations, if any, to the president. A few weeks later, the first shipment of <LOCATION> TOW </LOCATION> missiles was delivered to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The Americans hoped the weapons sales would lead to freedom for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Ultimately, three hostages were released during the 14-month period before the shipments were shopped in November 1986. Congressional committees and the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> made few references to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, portraying him as a largely passive figure. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> senators <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a Republican, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a Democrat, both members of the Iran-Contra committee, said in a book they wrote that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role remains an unanswered question. They wrote that others in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration were convinced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had supported the plan. `` The vice president attended several meetings on the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initiative, but none of the participants recall his views,'' the report said. In February 1986, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s task force on terrorism released a report recommending that no concessions be made to terrorists. In August 1986, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where he received a briefing on the arms-for-hostages deal from <PERSON> Amiram </PERSON> <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official who had worked with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> officials on the deal. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> said the weapons sales were designed to `` get and hostages out,'' as well as to `` build better contact with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> told the vice president: `` We are dealing with the most radical elements'' in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, according to the congressional report. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not comment except to thank <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> for pursuing the initiative `` despite doubts and reservations throughout the process.'' The congressional committees also concluded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not told about the diversion of money from the weapons sales to the Contra rebels. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s top foreign policy adviser, had extensive knowledge about certain elements of the resupply operation for the Contras, but did not tell <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about it, the report said. `` The vice president said he did not know of the Contra resupply operation,'' the congressional report said. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> testified that he was told about certain elements of the resupply operation by former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> in August 1986. But <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he never passed along his information to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because he `` did not consider these facts worthy of the vice president's attention.''

 A look at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s election for its 12th <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, on Tuesday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>VOTERS AND POLLING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Any Israeli citizen over age 18 is eligible to vote. There are 2.9 million registered voters, including 350,000 Arabs who live in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The country's total population is 4.4 million, including 750,000 Arabs. Included are 70,000 Jewish settlers who live in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> but are eligible to vote. Polls open at 7 a.m. -LRB- midnight EST Monday -RRB- and close at 10 p.m. -LRB- 3 p.m. EST -RRB-. About 80 percent usually vote, and ballots are counted by hand.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE KNESSET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> has 120 members. Any Israeli citizen over the age of 21 is eligible for election.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE GOVERNMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Israeli is a parliamentary democracy. The government is headed by a prime minister traditionally chosen from the party with the most seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>. The prime minister forms a cabinet, which must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PARTIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Israelis vote for parties, not individual candidates. The number of Knesset seats each wins depends on its proportion of the vote. Each party makes up numbered lists of candidates, and those gaining seats are chosen by their order on the list. Twenty-seven parties are running. The two major parties are the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc headed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s history, neither major party has ever won an absolute majority, meaning the government is always a coalition and small parties have influence beyond their numbers. Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> each have three allied parties as likely coalition partners. There also are eight religious parties which use their seats as swing votes to gain backing for Jewish Orthodox causes; two Arab parties; an Arab-Jewish party that favors creating a Palestinian state, and eight others, most championing single causes.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>OPINION POLLS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Most polls predict a close race, either with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and its allies winning narrowly or a split vote that will again create a <ORGANIZATION> Labor-Likud </ORGANIZATION> coalition such as has governed since the last election in 1984. Then, neither major party could form a government without the other. The polls are regarded as less than reliable because most are sponsored by Labor or Likud. Also, most do not survey Arabs, religious Jews, soldiers and residents of collective farms.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today scoffed at <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' weekend embrace of the liberal label, calling it a `` miracle of miracles.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the Republican has stood `` on the wrong side'' of every issue of importance to voters. With eight days left until Election Day, and some polls indicating a race closer than earlier surveys suggested, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shored up support in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rallied <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> supporters and said, `` I'm fired up.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had `` jumped all over me for using the ` L' word'' in their last debate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Well, speaking of my opponent, yesterday, miracle of miracles, headlines read all about it, he's using the liberal label again,'' the Republican nominee said in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, today. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also brushed off <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' invitation for a third debate, saying the real debate should be between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` the new left versus the old left.'' At stops from <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> on Sunday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told voters, `` We need a president in the tradition, yes, the liberal tradition of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dropped the `` L'' word _ as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regularly call it _ during his appearances today but still referred to the heritage of <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been `` on the wrong side of every issue,'' singling out issues of importance especially to women, such as pay equity, parental leave and health insurance. In a slap at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s long resume of appointed posts, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said, `` You ca n't inherit the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, you have to earn the right to be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Questioned by reporters about his decision to embrace the label he has shunned for months, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he comes from the liberal tradition of `` presidents who were on the side of average Americans, presidents who helped to build middle class <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was a liberal who believed in balancing budgets and that's the tradition I come from,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. Though the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign sought to characterize <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with its 47 electoral votes, as a tossup based on their internal polling, a new <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead, 51 percent to 44 percent. The poll of 510 likely voters was conducted Saturday and Sunday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stumped in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s suburbs on Sunday and briefly manned the phones at his campaign headquarters in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` This is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calling from the headquarters. We're trying to get the vote out I know you probably do n't believe it, but that's who it is,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee said in one call. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also delivered a pep talk to staff members at the headquarters, saying he and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, plan `` to keep running like we're 10 points behind. Nobody is going to out-work us.'' As part of a counteroffensive, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> announced late Sunday that a free lunch with the homeless will be held across the street from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>' Union Station at the same time as a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rally today. The lunch for clergy, veterans, the elderly and others is being sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clergy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, Students for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and other organizations, the campaign said in a statement. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, was focusing today on his home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> where a statewide poll released this weekend showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maintaining a strong lead. Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The latest nationwide poll, a <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> survey published today, found the Republican ticket leading Dukakis-Bentsen by 10 points, 50 percent to 40 percent. The survey of 1,096 probable voters was conducted Tuesday and Wednesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, said the campaign thought the race would tighten in the closing days of the campaign. `` I think it's to be expected as you get to the final days of the campaign that you're going to see some tightening in this race, but that's going to cause us to work harder,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. Buoyed by his campaign's tracking polls and some statewide surveys indicating a closer race, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> claimed that the battle for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is far from over. `` You can sense it, you can feel it, you can taste it,'' he said. Crowds chanted `` Give'em hell,'' and `` Tell it like it is,'' as the Democratic nominee made his way through the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> valley by <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train. A cheer also went up when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> proclaimed himself a liberal. In an interview with the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, taped Saturday and scheduled to air tonight, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said he was upset ith <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s definition of a liberal and the characteristics he tried to pin on his Democratic rival. `` The thing I object to is Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s use of the term in a way which I think is very deliberately designed to suggest that I and people like me do n't have a sense of values, that we're kind of permissive, that anything goes. And anybody who knows me knows that that's the farthest thing from who <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poachers Kill Kenya's White Rhino Herd</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Poachers raided a special reserve at night and slaughtered at least five white rhinoceroses, eliminating the animals from <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s public lands, authorities said Monday. The massacre by the 30 poachers occurred Sunday night at <ORGANIZATION> Meru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, east of snow-capped <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and 140 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, the capital, said Minister of Tourism and Wildlife <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhoho </PERSON>. Five rhinos were killed, he said. Several wildlife experts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, put the number at six. Thirteen elephants also were gunned down in the last week in different areas, the wildlife sources said. The killings came amid stepped-up anti-poaching efforts by the government since August, when <PERSON> Muhoho </PERSON> revealed the slaughter of 92 elephants in the previous three months and the government launched a highly publicized campaign to stop the killing. The white rhinos, which unlike the black rhino are not indigenous to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, were imported from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> about 20 years ago and lived under guard in a special reserve in the park. `` People watched over them day and night,'' said one of the sources. `` The rangers were wounded trying to defend them.'' The poachers escaped after hacking off the rhinos' valuable horns. One rhino horn can sell for up to $ 24,000 in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, where it is used to make traditional medicines, and in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, where it is fashioned into ornamental handles for daggers. The white rhino's numbers have not been reduced as sharply as have those of the black rhino, which were thought to number more than 60,000 in the early 1970s. Today, there are thought to be about 800 black rhino throughout <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Most of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white rhinos live in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where experts estimate the herd at about 3,000 strong. Twenty-five to 30 of the animals live in a private park in <ORGANIZATION> Solio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION>, near the equator southeast of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. Both types of rhino are a rather dark gray, with their visible differences lying mostly in horn size and lip shape. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> sent a paramilitary unit to Meru National Park to track the rhinos' poachers, said a government wildlife source. He declined to provide details. Gunmen in the last week slaughtered and hacked the tusks off five elephants in southeastern <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and eight elephants in the <LOCATION> Mathews </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION> in arid <LOCATION> Samburu </LOCATION> district 155 miles north of <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, the sources said. Their deaths bring to about 150 the number killed since April, according to published data. Wildlife officials estimate the toll is much higher. Studies by the Nairobi-based <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Environmental Program show that in the past 15 years, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s elephant population has dropped 85 percent. An aerial survey in February of <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and its environs found less than 5,500 elephants, down from 35,000 in 1974. Experts blame the intensifed slaughter on an all-time high of ivory prices, which have climbed steadily since the early 1970s and average about $ 82 per pound.

<TEXT>
 A fired-up <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned today as the political ally of women and young people, and said the noisy welcome he received in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` smells like victory to me.'' Taking a swipe at Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who rejected his invitation for an election-eve debate, the Democratic presidential nominee declared that `` you ca n't inherit the White House, you have to earn the right to be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was greeted by loudly cheering supporters at the student union building at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on the second day of a campaign swing through a state with 47 electoral votes, the most of any state. `` It smells like victory to me,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned Sunday as a born-again liberal but omitted the word from his <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> speech today when he referred to the heritage of Presidents Roosevelt, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Trying to attract wavering sources of traditional Democratic strength, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the Republican ticket of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> had been `` on the wrong side of every issue of special importance to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women.'' If people believed in such issues as pay equity, health insurance and parental leave, he said, `` then we're on your side.'' He also said he was separated from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by his stands on the environment and <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appointments. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as telling a 12-year-old girl that `` if she were raped and made pregnant by her father, the government had a right to force her to bear that child.'' The audience erupted in loud boos. As he left the building, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was cheered by several thousand people, mostly students, who stood outside the hall. `` You're fired up,'' he told them. Asked about his own mood, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied, `` I'm fired up.'' As he toured the lush <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> by train Sunday, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said confidently that his message `` is getting through'' and that `` this race is tightening up'' with polls showing he is narrowing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead in several key states. `` You can sense it, you can feel it, you can taste it,'' he said. Campaign aides said an internal poll showed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s former 10-point lead in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had shrunk to a dead heat. As he traveled by <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> predicted an upset victory on Nov. 8 and drew shouts of `` Give'em hell,'' and `` Tell it like it is,'' from crowds that gathered under cloudless skies. From <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, the train passed through the rich agricultural valley, past fields of cotton and vineyards and orchards. Accompanying the candidate were Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and Reps. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON>, as well as a carload of financial contributors. `` The pollsters and the press have been trying to tell us the election is over,'' said <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>. `` We'll show them on Election Day.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took up the same theme. `` It wo n't be the pollsters and the pundits who vote on Election Day,'' he said. `` It will be you.'' The candidate said his improved standing in polls is the result of work by `` a wonderful network of volunteers across the country'' and because `` our message of standing on the side of working Americans is getting through.'' Suddenly, he no longer shied away from the `` L-word.'' `` We need a president in the tradition, yes, the liberal tradition of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roois </PERSON> the outgoing vice president. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reasoned that a vice president only has to move down the hall. Regardless of who wins, the transition headquarters will be ready for immediate occupancy. By Election Day, telephones will be installed, copying machines will be plugged in and furniture will be in place. Stationery already had been ordered with a politically neutral heading of `` Office of the President-elect.'' Along with the government offices, the building at 1825 <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> N.W. houses a drug store, <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant and Pakistani bank. Across the street is a bath house that once was a massage parlor. Representatives of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigns have worked with the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the federal housekeeping agency, on arrangements in the building. Both say they do n't need all of the three full floors and a part of a fourth that have been offered. In the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, transition director <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> has put her planning on hold as her candidate tries to stage a political comeback. In the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, where the rule is to avoid overconfidence, transition director <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> is reluctant to talk about his months of preparation. `` I'm in no position to answer because that's in the new world. It wo n't dawn until after he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- happens to be elected,'' said <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, who works out of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. If the polls are correct and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins, he will face a situation that is unique in the last 152 years of political history. Not since 1836 has a sitting vice president been elected to the presidency. That was when <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> moved up from understudy to president. How would it affect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>? Would <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> begin to defer to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>? Who would be in charge? `` The great historic example was in 1932 when the banking crisis was hard upon the land,'' <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> recalled. `` President -LRB- <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> asked President-elect -LRB- Franklin D. -RRB- Roosevelt what he aimed to do, and <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> declined to answer because he felt that was improper _ that the president is the president until he leaves office. `` Obviously their relationship was marked by a great deal of bitterness because <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> trounced him during the election but that offer was declined,'' <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> said. Even though there would be no bitterness between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> noted that, `` The president-elect -LRB- is the one who -RRB- gets all the attention. The incumbent president is the one that people have to be reminded of.'' Nevertheless, <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> says, `` The vice president has shown throughout his vice presidency that he has held the president in the highest esteem and honors him as the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and will until noon on the 20th of January. `` And I ca n't believe that even though, as history suggests, the fullest, brightest lights are going to be put on him -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- during what they used to call the interregnum that he will in any way appear to take that light from the president until he himself is president,'' said <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>. However, he said that if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office on Jan. 20, `` It is a new administration ... It would not be <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s third term. It would be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first term.''

 Top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arms control officials met Monday at the Soviets' request to discuss the Krasnoyarsk radar in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says violates the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. The delegations, headed by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> director, and <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, the head of the arms control desk at the Soviet foreign ministry, met at the Soviet diplomatic mission, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the meeting had been requested by the Soviets and that the talks were expected to last `` a few days.'' `` Our purpose in these talks is to listen to the Soviet proposals and to clarify Soviet positions on actions that they are prepared to take to correct the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> problem,'' said the spokesman. The Soviet government announced last week that it was giving the controversial radar site to the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> for use as a civilian-run international space research center. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a speech in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Friday, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is listening to what the Soviets have to say about <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position remains unchanged. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said that the Soviets must dismantle the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> facility in order to comply with the ABM treaty. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials maintain the radar violates the treaty, which limits each side's anti-ballistic missile facilities, because of its location and orientation. The two sides met in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in August for their third periodic review of the treaty. At the close of the one-week session, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side issued a statement saying it ws not satisfied with the Soviet response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns about the radar, and threatened to take action that could terminate or suspend the ABM treaty.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today relaxed trade, travel and diplomatic restrictions against <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to support South Korean efforts at easing tensions on the peninsula. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will encourage unofficial non-governmental visits from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in academics, sports, culture and other areas. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> also said financial regulations are being revised to permit group travel by Americans on a case-by-case basis. American diplomats will be allowed substantive contact with North Korean diplomats for the first time in almost a year, he said. In addition, the spokesman said, commercial exports of humanitarian goods to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will be allowed on a limited basis. Currently, humanitarian items must be donated. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> stressed that general commercial trade will still be illegal and that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> `` remains on our list of states which support or are engaged in international terrorism. `` Its behavior in this area is something we will continue to scrutinize closely,'' he said. The moves are a complement to efforts by South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON>, who has called for a north-south summit meeting and a resumption of trade between the two <LOCATION> Koreas </LOCATION> as part of an attempt to ease tensions. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> met with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> 10 days ago and suggested the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> act in coordination with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s own moves. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is one of the few countries in the world with which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no diplomatic relations, and it has been the target of a highly restrictive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo. In a gesture to the north in early 1987, the administration removed a prohibition on diplomatic contacts, but then restored it after what officials said was convincing evidence of North Korean complicity in the November 1987 bombing of a South Korean passenger plane that killed all 115 aboard. Since <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s visit, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been working with the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies to carry out the paperwork necessary to implement the expected changes, the officials said. Historically, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help, tried to isolate <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has altered that policy with his call for north-south trade and for an unprecedented summit meeting with President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il-Sung </PERSON>. As <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials see it, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s moves reflect increased South Korean self-confidence based on the country's growing economic strength and the success of the Olympic games held in September in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> made no attempt to disrupt the games, which <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> took as an encouraging sign. He proposed the summit shortly after the games concluded, reflecting, in part, strong domestic pressure to make an effort that could lead to the eventual peaceful reunification of the peninsula. The officials said recent developments have left <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> more isolated than before. Its principal backers, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, ignored <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s appeals for a boycott of the Olympics. Only <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and a handful of other leftist countries supported the North Korean call.

<TEXT>
 Groups of workers in separate parts of the state claimed to hold two of three winning tickets for a $ 60.8 million lotto jackpot said to be the world's largest lottery prize. `` The lady who found we had a winning ticket screamed,'' said <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dragon </PERSON>, a member of the group of 14 workers at <LOCATION> Fallbrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and a friend who attended a party Saturday night to watch the winning numbers drawn. `` Then everybody started dreaming about what we were going to do with the money,'' <PERSON> Dragon </PERSON>, a 38-year-old pharmacy technician, said Sunday. `` I'm going to set up trust funds for my four kids and pay off bills. But for Thanksgiving, we're -LRB- the group -RRB- all going to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> or someplace like that.'' The second group of 25 workers at a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> appliance service department in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> were said today to have a second ticket, while the third was claimed to be held by a couple from <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Lottery officials scheduled but then canceled a news conference with the 25 <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> winners. Lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rendahl </PERSON> said the workers then decided they did n't want the publicity and had to return to work. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he was uncertain whether tickets could be checked in time for a news conference with the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> group today, but that a news conference with the potential Westminster winner was possible. Lottery spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he could not confirm that the claimants held winning tickets until the stubs were verified, probably later today. Each winning ticket is worth a third of the jackpot, or nearly $ 20.3 million, to be paid over two decades. The winning numbers were 5, 20, 26, 28, 32 and 39. Surinder Sanghera, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Sangheras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liquors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> where a winning ticket was sold, said it was bought by a pool of 25 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> employees. `` They are regulars,'' he said. `` I think they've been buying here since the lotto began.'' A woman answering the phone at the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> service center this morning said that she and 24 other workers there were joint winners. She added, `` I'm pretty excited about it. Would n't anybody be?'' before hanging up the phone without giving her name. The Los Angeles Times and <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the Westminster winner is <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 45-year-old production supervisor. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he had bought five lottery tickets. `` We're very common, real people,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, told the Register. `` We have our friends and this is our house. We're not going to move. The two now earn about $ 40,000 a year. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he'll quit his job at <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> so he and his wife can travel. He went to work Sunday and told his co-workers. `` They thought I was kidding,'' he said. `` Then they decided I was serious.'' The group at the hospital in <LOCATION> Fallbrook </LOCATION> purchased $ 600 worth of tickets, with each member of the group kicking in $ 15 apiece, <PERSON> Dragon </PERSON> said. She said all agreed they would split what winnings came from the `` Quick Pick'' tickets. `` Quick Pick'' means that the numbers on the $ 1 tickets were selected at random by a computerized lotto terminal. The tickets were purchased at a Circle K convenience store, she said. Lottery officials verified that the winning ticket in <LOCATION> Fallbrook </LOCATION> was purchased in a Circle <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dragon </PERSON> said the winning ticket was placed in a bank vault Sunday. If verified, it would be worth more than $ 67,000 a year before taxes for 20 years to each of the 15. Each of the three winning tickets is worth $ 20,296,175, one-third of the $ 60,888,525 jackpot, said lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kossack </PERSON>. The prize was the world's largest lottery jackpot, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. The previous world record was $ 56 million in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gordo </LOCATION> lottery in 1983, according to <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenza </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Players </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moorestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The previous North American record was a $ 55.16 million <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lottery jackpot last month, but that prize went to a single winner.

<TEXT>
 The Lenin shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> has symbolized the struggle for free unions since the tumult of August 1980, when a 36-year-old electrician named <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> led the strike that created Solidarity. The yard once was a showcase of industry in communist <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but never recovered after the martial law crackdown of Dec. 13, 1981, that crushed Solidarity, the first independent union in the Soviet bloc. Solidarity was recognized as a legal union after the 18-day strike led by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who still works at yard named for the founder of the Soviet state. It was formally outlawed in 1982 and, like the shipyard that spawned it, never regained the power of that heady first summer. Officials now have decided to close the shipyard Dec. 1, citing the need to discontinue money-losing state enterprises. Baltic coast shipyards have been hotbeds of political activity since the 1970s. The killing by police of scores of workers during food-price riots in December 1970 inspired a generation of workers to demand free unions. The immediate cause of the 1980 strike at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> yard, which began Aug. 14, was the dismissal in July of a popular woman who worked as a crane operator. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who had been fired in 1976, vaulted the fence into the shipyard to lead it. Soon after it was legalized, Solidarity claimed 10 million members, including thousands belonging to the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. When it was banned in October 1982, Solidarity maintained a leadership structure underground. Workers at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard joined strikes in May and August of this year, the worst in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since 1981, and authorities began to suggest closing the operation. At its height of prosperity in the 1970s, the yard employed more than 15,000 workers. A billboard on the grounds lists 27 countries for which it has built nearly 900 ships since World War II. Much of its equipment has become rusted during the bad times, and only about 10,000 employees remain. Many ardent supporters of Solidarity were fired or have drifted away since martial law to higher-paying jobs in construction or other fields. A new generation of militant young workers has taken up the Solidarity banner, however, pressing bread-and-butter issues like pay and housing. Even when the shipyard is closed, the site will remain a strong symbol of the free union. Outside the gates are three metal crosses 130 feet tall erected by Solidarity in its heyday to honor the workers slain in 1970.

 Shadowy figures flit through the halls after dark. Burglar alarms go off for no apparent reason. Things go bump in the night. Sound like a Halloween haunted house? Actually, it's the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>. Through the years, nighttime security guards have reported ghostly figures stalking halls and noises in deserted parts of the museum, which was built shortly after the turn of the century. `` There's nothing worse than closing this place up at night,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Campion </PERSON>, who works in the gift shop. <PERSON> Campion </PERSON> says any creaks and thumps probably come from settling of the building, but he admits that he would be reluctant to spend a night in the place.

<HEAD>China's First Bankruptcy Law Goes into Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first bankruptcy law takes effect Tuesday, creating a legal framework for closing thousands of inefficient state-run enterprises. Economists say that in its initial stages, the law will be used more as a threat to debt-ridden firms and few will be closed. Since 1986, when bankruptcy experiments started in several cities, only two small state-owned businesses have been closed. The new law is part of overall reforms designed to end lifetime employment, tie wages and benefits to work performance, and redefine the state's relationship to business. It was passed in December 1986 with the stipulation it would take effect three months after another new law, which gives factories greater operating autonomy. The bankruptcy legislation could affect the nearly 7,000 state-run companies running in the red. These companies _ 17 percent of the nation's state-run businesses _ lost almost $ 1 billion in the first half of 1988, up 27 percent from the same period in 1987. The government will spend about $ 10.8 billion this year to prop up the ailing industries. The bankruptcy law applies to firms that have suffered `` heavy losses,'' but does not pinpoint which companies should be the target of closures. Under the law, the state will auction off the fixed assets of enterprises declared insolvent. Efforts will also be made to merge money losers with stronger businesses. The efficient firms will have the right to reassign workers or change the product line of the plant taken over. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday the introduction of bankruptcy, once regarded as a symbol of capitalist decay, is `` sending a shiver down the spines of directors and workers in money-losing enterprises.'' It quoted <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yinjie </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> as saying his office was not sure `` how to determine what kind of enterprises should go bankrupt and then, having decided that, how to bring them to court.'' <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> also brought up the labor issue, saying, `` What if the workers who have been fired throng around the government buildings, raising signs and chanting ` I want to work, I am hungry.''' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which only recently acknowledged that unemployment existed in the socialist state, puts unemployment at 2 percent. Chinese economists say the jobless rate will hit 4 percent or 5 percent as factories trim excess laborers or go broke. Despite new statutes giving factory managers the right to hire and fire workers, few people have lost their jobs and large scale layoffs are rare. Under an unemployment insurance program being tried in several cities, enterprises pay into a relief fund and laid-off workers are eligible for benefits of 75 percent of their salary for the first 12 months and 50 percent for the second 12 months. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the past month has called a temporary halt to price reforms and reasserted controls over bank loans and foreign trade in the face of a badly overheated economy and an inflation rate of more than 20 percent. However, Chinese leaders insist they remain committed to the 10-year program of switching to an economy directed by market forces rather than central planning. The government appears to be pushing ahead with measures to restructure the state ownership system, such as the selling of shares in state factories, auctioning off smaller state firms to collective or private businesses, instituting the contract system and introducing bankruptcy.

<HEAD>Californians Will Decide Expensive Ballot Contest over Auto
Premiums</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE GEISSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In this state infatuated with cars but infuriated by soaring auto premiums, the insurance industry has raised a record $ 42.6 million for a campaign to defeat consumer-backed ballot proposals that would slash rates by at least 20 percent. The contest over five conflicting auto insurance reform measures on Nov. 8 ballots has grown into the most expensive political struggle ever waged outside a presidential contest. All told, a combined $ 60 million has been poured into a political war pitting consumer advocates, insurers and trial lawyers against one another. Industry analysts express fears that support for the tougher rate-cutting measures could spawn a nationwide `` insurance revolt.'' More immediately, if Californians approve more than one of the five conflicting measures, it could likely trigger court battles that would produce unexpected hybrids. But polls show Californians leaning toward approval of Proposition 103, the deepest and broadest of the measures on the ballot. Proposition 103, supported by consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, would lower almost all rates by an immediate 20 percent below November 1987 rates. It would require an additional 20 percent cut in insurance rates for good drivers. It also would give an elected insurance commissioner control over future rate increases, limit use of territorial rating to set auto insurance premiums and subject the industry to state antitrust and unfair business practice laws. The rush to reform auto insurance was spurred by rates which have risen 40 percent between mid-1985 and the end of 1987, according to legislative studies. The insurance industry claims its profits in the state are slim to none. It placed rival Proposition 104 on the ballot, a 24,000-word measure that would create a no-fault system, temporarily cut personal injury premiums by an average 20 percent, and prohibit recovery for pain-and-suffering damages unless injuries result in death or permanent and serious disability. `` The key is getting a good no-fault law passed. And the bargain that the insurance industry is offering you ... is a good no-fault law ... I think it's a bargain you ought to strike with them,'' says <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, an expert on accident law who is backing Proposition 104. A second industry-backed measure, Proposition 106, would limit the contingency fees attorneys could charge their clients. The fees are the payment an attorney gets from a settlement won for a client who can not afford the regular pay-as-you-go arrangement. The industry says high contingency fees drive up insurance rates. But foes say the measure would make it difficult for victims of accidents to hire qualified legal counsel, while placing no limits on fees paid to lawyers working for insurance companies. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> claims the insurance industry placed its rival measures on the ballot as a tactic to muddy the water. `` When Proposition 103 first hit the streets to get signatures -LRB- to qualify it for the ballot -RRB-, the insurance companies realized they would have a very difficult time defeating it, so they put ... their propositions on the ballot to confuse the public and their ads are furthering that end,'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said. Adding to the confusion is Proposition 100, financed largely by trial lawyers and sponsored by consumer groups, which would immediately roll back good drivers' rates by 20 percent below those charged on Jan. 1, 1988. The measure also would prohibit limits on lawyers' fees. A fifth measure, Proposition 101, sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assemblyman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polanco </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, would cut certain premiums by up to 35 percent by capping attorney fees and injury claims. Trial lawyers and consumer groups argue that the measure would leave loopholes for insurers to raise rates. Industry officials insist that Propositions 100 and 103 would drive up rates in all but four <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> counties because companies could no longer use territorial rating and therefore would no longer be able to charge <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> residents for the high cost of claims there. Proponents counter that their measures would not end territorial rating, but would force insurers to justify it. The industry also says many companies would abandon <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the face of rate cuts in Propositions 100 and 103, but supporters term such threats scare tactics.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of farmers camped on a road to the presidential palace ended their weeklong protest Monday, saying the government will consider their demands for higher crop prices. Their withdrawal came soon after Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> addressed a party rally in memory of his slain mother, former premier <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. The rally of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was to be held at the site of the farmers' protest but was shifted to a park in front of the 17th-century <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION>, about 3 -LCB- miles from the presidential palace. `` We have shown our strength,'' said <PERSON> Mahavir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, one of the farmers' leaders who spoke to reporters as hundreds of tractors drove down the Rajpath or Avenue of Kings and out of the city. Many farmers viewed their protest as a success because it forced a new venue on the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rally. <PERSON> Mahender </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikait </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, called off the protest. He said the government has assured a farmers' delegation that their demands will be considered. Police said at least 40,000 farmers camped on <LOCATION> Rajpath </LOCATION> since last Monday. Most slept under the shade of their tractors by day and burned fires of cow dung to keep warm at night. `` Their protest became meaningless after they forced the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to shift their rally,'' said <PERSON> Ajay </PERSON> <PERSON> Aggarwal </PERSON>, a police officer posted at the sit-in site. But the farmers say they will continue a non-cooperation movement and refuse to pay taxes until government assurances become concrete offers, according to <PERSON> Mahavir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. Among demands are that farmers get free electricity. `` We are happy with what we have achieved,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. `` If the government does not honor its assurances we can always come back. And if we come back, we wo n't leave.'' At least 500,000 people gathered on the dusty grounds at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rally. During a 45-minute speech delivered in Hindi, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> repeatedly told the crowd that his party had ushered in an agricultural `` green revolution'' and was trying to help farmers. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> did not specifically refer to the farmers' demands. The rally was called to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the assassination of <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who led the party for nearly two decades.

The independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said an official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> announcement `` is expected to be made soon,'' saying <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would not meet its Tuesday target to begin withdrawing from the territory, popularly called <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The withdrawal was to lead to June 1 independence elections supervised by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> defied to continue its 73-year rule of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> set the Tuesday date and the government's official stance Monday was that the target holds, but it would not be responsible if other parties were not ready. South African newspapers have reported recently that President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is seeking to begin the independence process on Jan. 1, 1989, since it became clear Tuesday's deadline would not be met. `` We're prepared to move at any time,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s administrator for the territory. But <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s proposal was contingent on an agreement for the departure of 50,000 Cuban troops supporting the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediators have held periodic talks since May, but have been unable to set a timetable for Cuban troops to withdraw. No new date has been set to resume negotiations. The South African agency said that in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> early this month, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediator <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> had asked for responses to the compromise plan by Oct. 12. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> is Undersecretary of State for African Affairs. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, according to informed sources here, met the deadline, but the other two have not yet responded,'' <ORGANIZATION> SAPA </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. It said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan called for half the Cubans to leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> before elections in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and the remainder to move north of the 15th parallel. This would distance them from the Namibian border so they could not support <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas who have been fighting South African rule for more than two decades. The second stage, <ORGANIZATION> SAPA </ORGANIZATION> reported, would involve reducing the Cuban strength to one-fourth its present strength by the end of the first year. Remaining Cuban troops would leave by the end of the second year.

 Police are concerned about their record _ their record of satisfaction, that is. To see how they're doing, the department sent questionnaires to 68 people who were victims, arrested, or given summonses. The two-page survey, mailed Sept. 1, asks such questions as: `` Understanding that this may have been a difficult situation, were you generally satisfied with the <ORGANIZATION> Scituate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>?'' The survey, named `` Project Image,'' is based on a program developed by a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> police department. Replies will be reveiwed by a committee including the police chief, the president of the police union, town officials and a resident. If the results warrant, the review committee may recommend changes to the department. The 28 people who have returned surveys gave the department high marks. None of the surveys returned so far are from the three individuals arrested by the department, who are being held at the Adult Correctional Institutions.

<HEAD>District of Columbia Sets New Homicide Record as Drug Battles Rage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nation's capital set a grisly standard Monday when police recorded the 288th homicide of 1988, a city record for the most homicides in a single year. The 288 deaths exceeded the previous mark of 287 homicides set in 1969. Authorities blamed the upsurge in violence on drugs. The latest victim was identified only as a Hispanic male who died at about 6 a.m. at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cockett </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It was not known how the man got to the hospital. Homicide detectives believed he may have been stabbed about 8 p.m. Sunday. No motive had been established. Police Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> has blamed the high number of slayings on violent turf battles between drug dealers. Sixty percent of the year's homicides have been drug-related, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said, compared with 33 percent as recently as 1986. In the past couple of years, Jamaican drug gangs have infiltrated the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> metropolitan area, local and federal authorities say. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said the turf battles have been exacerbated by the introduction of new drugs into the city. `` This is one of the last major cities in this country to have an infusion of crack,'' a highly addictive cocaine derivative, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` When crack arrived in other cities, like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, murder rates went up there too.'' Most recently, a drug combining marijuana, PCP and cocaine has hit the streets, fueling the wars. `` It's called ` beaming,' short for ` Beam me up, <PERSON> Scotty </PERSON>,''' Ms. <PERSON> Cockett </PERSON> said, referring to an expression from the old `` Star Trek'' television series. Turner over the weekend said officers still are not armed with 9mm semiautomatic weapons to combat heavily armed drug dealers, despite a promise he made eight months ago, because no money in the city's fiscal 1988 budget was earmarked for the weapons. But <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> promised officers would be equipped with more sophisticated weapons within two years. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hankins </PERSON>, chairman of the labor committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, blasted the department for failing to protect officers. `` It's ridiculous that it has taken the police department this long to develop specifications for a weapon that everyone agreed was urgently needed,'' he said. `` It's a miracle that one of us has n't already died because he's outgunned,'' <PERSON> Hankins </PERSON> said The 9mm semiautomatic weapons fire more rapidly than the .38 caliber revolvers officers currently carry, and allow them to fire an additional 10 bullets before reloading. The <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s police force has been cut to 3,800, down from 5,100 in 1977, but <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said more officers would n't necessarily be able to stem the drug trafficking and cut the rate of killing He said putting more officers on the streets might produce more arrests, but the city's overflowing prison system has no room to house additional inmates.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have settled most of their differences over the disputed eastern section of the Sino-Soviet border, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Monday. At the conclusion of border negotiations that began Oct. 20, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met with the chief Chinese negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeng </PERSON> <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>, said spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. He said talks would continue on remaining areas of dispute along the eastern border and that the two sides agreed to form a joint working group on their differences over the western frontier. The Sino-Soviet border east of <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> is about 1,500 miles long, while the western section stretches about 1,100 miles. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> provided large amounts of aid to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after the victory of the Chinese communists in 1949. But relations between the two communist powers deteriorated sharply in the late 1950s as they vied for dominance in the world communist movement. Soviet and Chinese soldiers traded gunfire across the border in 1969. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has tried to ease tension with the Chinese since he took power in 1985. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders have made improved relations contingent on the removal of Soviet soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, settlement of the <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> conflict and reduction of tension along the border.

<TEXT>
 An earthquake centered in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> shook the capital and several provincial towns Monday, injuring at least 27 people, officials said. The earthquake, which struck about 11:14 a.m. and registered 5.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, was centered about 30 miles offshore, according to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomy </ORGANIZATION>, Astrophysics and Geophysics. It lasted for about 10 seconds. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the quake caused no deaths, but that preliminary reports indicated 27 people had been injured. Among those injured were 10 children in the town of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Affroun </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Blida </LOCATION> region 30 miles outside <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. Officials said the children were hurt when the roof of their school fell in. Several construction workers also were reported injured when several buildings under construction cracked or caved in, according to the official Algerian news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Algerie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

 Sixth-graders in the <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> will have a new kind of homework assignment this spring: Earn money to give to someone else. The Best Program was created last year for 116 sixth-graders at <ORGANIZATION> Raines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where administrators feared students from deprived neighborhoods would be easy recruits for gangs and drug dealers. `` We had a troubled group of sixth-graders last year. They had low self-esteem, no self-motivation, homework was just brought in in a sloppy manner,'' <PERSON> Raines </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Hambrick </PERSON> said. `` I knew that we had to try to do something for these children before they got away from us.'' `` So we were looking for a counselor, a mentor, somebody, anything. We knew that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> -LRB- general manager -RRB- at <ORGANIZATION> WLBT-TV </ORGANIZATION> studios had done extensive work with gangs and troubled youth, so we called the studio and his secretary said we ought to talk with Dr. <PERSON> Yazdani </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Nanolla </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazdani </PERSON>, a psychologist, was working with <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> on developing anti-gang programs for the city. <PERSON> Yazdani </PERSON> had gained international publicity after developing a program for first-time, non-violent offenders at the <ORGANIZATION> Misssissippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION>. The prison program, which he no longer oversees, was patterned after <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bootcamp _ right down to the spit-polished boots worn by the inmates and their rigorous regimen of calisthenics. <PERSON> Yazdani </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Raines </PERSON> <PERSON> Elementary </PERSON> and designed a program for sixth-graders. This summer, he trained teachers from 10 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> elementary schools on his program's techniques. This spring, educators plan to expand the program to all sixth grades in the system, 2,562 pupils. Youngsters must have parents' permission to take part Meanwhile, some teachers are already putting <PERSON> Yazdani </PERSON>'s techniques to work, like <PERSON> Sadie </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, who oversees an after-school day-care program for pupils of all ages Her students do n't march like <PERSON> Yazdani </PERSON>'s prison recruits, but they do sound out some strong cadences. Standing tall, heads erect and hands behind their backs, the youngsters repeat their rhythmic Best Program creed: `` I am somebody; I will never use drugs. `` I am somebody; what my mind can conceive `` And my heart can believe, I will achieve. `` I am somebody; I will make you proud of me. `` I am somebody; I will do my work `` And I will love my fellow man, I am somebody.'' The Best Program's definition of being somebody includes the ability and willingness to do things for somebody else. Last year, the <PERSON> Raines </PERSON> sixth-graders held car washes, then used the earnings to take pizzas to deaf students at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Magnolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The school's four sixth-grade classes worked as groups on their fund-raising, but individuals are encouraged to daily share their knowledge with others. Part of their homework is living the Best Program motto: `` Each one, teach one.'' Each child is helped to identify knowledge and skills he can share, <PERSON> Hambrick </PERSON> said. To do their best, the children are taught to stick with a task until it's completed, take criticism and think creatively. <PERSON> Hambrick </PERSON> said she saw children disinterested in school become model students after <PERSON> Yazdani </PERSON>'s 20-session program last year. Last spring, sixth-graders scored an average of 6.5 in mathematics on the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Achievement Test, compared to 5.8 among sixth-graders at <LOCATION> Raines </LOCATION> the year before. In study skills, scores went from 5.8 in the spring of 1987 to 6.8 this spring, the principal said. A score of 6 is indicative of expected sixth-grade work. `` Somebody asked me, ` How is it that when they have to go back into the school room and they have to learn 10 spelling words, why do they learn those 10 spelling words now?' `` I think it is because they have learned the value of learning the 10 spelling words. It's not because somebody tells them they have to learn the 10 spelling words,'' <PERSON> Hambrick </PERSON> said. `` They've set their own goals for themselves.''

 Actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>, who gained wide fame late in life for his Oscar-winning role as a law professor in the movie `` The Paper Chase'' after a long career as a theater and film producer, has died, a friend said today. He was 86. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> died during the night at his home, said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goff </PERSON>, a family friend and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> scriptwriter. He died of spinal cancer. The Romanian-born <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> became a household name while in his 70s as Professor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsfield </PERSON> in `` The Paper Chase,'' a role he first played in the 1973 film and then in the television series. He parlayed that fame and his distinctive speaking style into a lucrative series of commercial endorsements, including ads for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> in which he bellowed, `` They make money the old-fashioned way _ they EARRNNN it.'' But before that, he was best known as a producer, director and writer for both the stage and film. During a tribute to him in 1987 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> said: `` The only important thing when you've lived as long as I have is what you've accomplished _ a body of work. ... We all tend to talk about our successes. At least as important are our failures.'' He first earned wide recognition in 1934 as the director of a Broadway production of the <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein-Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> opera `` Four Saints in Three Acts.'' In 1937, after two years in the government-funded Federal Theatre Project, he helped <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION> form the Mercury Theater in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, one of several repertory theater companies he helped form over the years. Its first production was a modern-dress version of `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>.'' He was also involved in writing and producing shows for the Mercury Theater of the Air, the radio form of the troupe. He was a co-producer of the troupe's epic 1938 `` War of the Worlds'' that created a nationwide panic just 50 years ago Sunday with its realistic portrayal of radio news coverage of a Martian landing. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> also had a key role in putting together Welles' landmark 1941 film, `` Citizen Kane,'' including collaborating on the script During World War II, he spent 1 -LCB- years at the federal Office of War Information as head of programming for overseas radio operations. His office put out `` <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>'' broadcasts in 27 languages. Among his film production credits were `` The Bad and the Beautiful,'' 1952, a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> drama starring <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>; `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>,'' 1953, with <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>; and `` Lust for Life,'' 1956, the biography of artist <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> that won a supporting actor Oscar for <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houseman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was named for him. It is home to the Acting Company, a touring repertory company he co-founded in 1972. Among its well-known alumni are actress <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON> of `` Evita.'' Also in 1986, he was honored by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> for `` outstanding achievement and dedication to the enrichment of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cultural legacy.'' `` Your charm, eloquence and excellence are a delight to all of us,'' Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said at the time In September, <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> said that he had no plans to slow down from a career that included involvement in scores of stage, screen and broadcast productions. `` I have tapered off a little, but I would n't know what to do with myself if I retired,'' he said three days before his 86th birthday. `` I still have something to offer, even though the roles these days are usually small. `` But I'm 85 years old. I am not going to be offered the role of <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> anymore, or Juliet, for that matter. Yet the limited range I do play, I play well. My range is that of an old man, but what do you expect from someone who started acting at the age of 70?'' In addition to `` The Paper Chase,'' his movie acting credits included roles in `` Seven Days in May,'' 1964; `` Three Days of the Condor,'' 1975; `` Rollerball,'' 1975; and `` Wholly Moses,'' 1980. He also appeared in a number of made-for-television movies and miniseries, such as `` The Winds of War'' and `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ Behind Closed Doors.'' He was the author of a critically acclaimed series of memoirs, including `` Run-Through'' and `` Front and Center.'' His career also included a stint as an educator: He headed the drama department at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s famous Juilliard School from 1968 to 1976. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> was born <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, on Sept. 22, 1902. The son of a wealthy grain merchant, he was educated largely in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. He came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1924, working in the grain business while translating plays as a hobby, until the economic collapse of 1929 when he went into the theater full-time.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today denied statements by hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> on a videotape released by his kidnappers that his administration interfered with the release of hostages or bargained with terrorists. `` I do n't think that was <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> speaking,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of the tape. `` I think he had a script that was given to him.'' When asked about the statement on the tape that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government interfered when the hostages were about to be released, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` That is absolutely not true, but let me point something out. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in that terrible confinement at the hands of those barbarians _ any information he has has to have come from there; there is no contact with the outside world.'' `` We have been doing everything we can for the release of the hostages, and the very simple answer is, for those people, to let them go,'' the president said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> answered reporters' questions after signing legislation clearing the way for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entry into an international copyright agreement. `` There has never been any interference, nor have we ever been negotiating any more than we would with any other kind of a kidnapper on a ransom type of basis,'' he said. When asked whether he thought the kidnapers were trying to influence the outcome of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election, he said, `` You'd have to ask them; I ca n't fathom their minds.'' The president disputed a statement on the tape that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was involved in negotiations with terrorists in the Iran-Contra affair and a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking. `` Nor was I, because we were never doing anything of that kind,'' he said. When asked what he thought were the circumstances in which the tape was made, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` You have to remember, these men are in the closest type of confinement. ... you have to recognize that no hostage is taking something on himself; they're telling him what to do.'' About prospects for the release of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and other Americans held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the president said, `` I'm not going to give up hope for any of our hostages that are held. That's just too unthinkable.'' But, he said, `` the one thing we can not do is negotiate with the kidnappers on a sort of ransom idea because that just encourages more kidnapping and more hsotage-taking.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said release of the videotape was `` a cynical attempt to use the hostages to influence public opinion, and the only real answer is for them to release the hostages immediately.'' `` It's not clear what they are trying to achieve, but it's obviously meant to influence the election'' eight days away, he said In the tape released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said: `` I have been very close to being released several times over the past three years, but each time it seems that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government uses its influence to stop any agreement and I do n't understand this. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that statement was `` simply not true.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> also urged the administration to negotiate his release and appealed to the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to end the plight of the hostages. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said it wo n't negotiate with terrorists. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he was `` not asking <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to deal with terrorists, although Mr. -LRB- George -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did so in the Iran-Contra affair and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking.'' He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that statement was `` totally incorrect, wrong.'' He declined to elaborate, saying he assumed the vice president would speak for himself. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the tape `` has some political statements in it that are cynical certainly and most unfortunate for the hostage families and for all of us who care about their plight.'' Asked whether he regarded <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, as cynical, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I think the hostage-takers are, the kidnapers; I do n't think <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> had much choice.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the statements in the tape `` are outrageous; they are cynical; they are an affront to the families of the hostages and to the American people.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today announced plans to sell <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, its corporate headquarters and the world's tallest building, as part of an effort to streamline the company <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' restructing plan also will include a stock buyback, `` intense cost-cutting'' programs and the sale of its commercial real estate subsidiary, the nation's largest retailer said. `` We are acutely aware of investors' desires for improved returns and enhanced share value,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. `` And over the past year, we have thoroughly evaluated all strategic and financial alternatives available to the company. `` These alternatives have been reviewed not only with regard to shorter-term valuation objectives, but also giving consideration to the longer-term needs of our customers and $ 526,000 employees, the financial strength of our company and fulfillment of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' long-term strategic potential,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said The Sears Tower, which rises 110 stories _ 1,450 feet _ from the grid of the downtown Loop business district, was built in 1974. The statement did not indicate how much <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> hoped to get for the landmark building. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said it would continue to serve as corporate headquarters for the company, although the 8,000-employee <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> would be moved to smaller, less costly facilities over the next several years. The move would leave just 600 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> workers in the building, officials said. Counting employees of both <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> and other companies, there are now about 13,000 people working at the tower. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said it anticipated $ 425 million in expenses related to the sale of the building and other changes announced today, and would deduct that amount from fourth-quarter earnings. However, the company said it expected to add $ 340 million in net income for the year as a result of other accounting changes. The stock buyback program will be aimed at acquiring up to 40 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> common stock, or approximately 10 percent of the company's 380 million outstanding shares. The restructuring plan also calls for divestiture of the commercial division of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coldwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, redirection of its <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> division and strengthening of its financial services subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, with a greater commitment to consumer-driven activities. The corporate moves to cut costs and redeploy assets `` will enable <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> to compete more effectively and profitably in its merchandising, insurance, financial services and real estate businesses,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. At a news conference today, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> was asked what message the restructuring plans were intended to send to <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' huge number of customers. `` The message is we are positioning <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> strategically and financially for a period of unprecedented growth,'' he said. But <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stock declined 87 -LCB- cents to $ 42.75 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading today after the restructuring was announced. Speculation about a restructuring of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> have been circulating for months, as have reports that the company was seeking to sell off several of its divisions. Last Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> reported its third-quarter net income fell 16 percent from the year-earlier period, marking the third consecutive quarter of declining profits. It blamed the results on flat merchandise sales and intense competition from other retailers. Net income for the quarter totaled $ 344.2 million, or 90 cents per share, for the three months ending Sept. 30. That compared with $ 409 million, or $ 1.08 a share, for third-quarter 1987.

<TEXT>
 Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers today released a videotape of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who read a message accusing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government of preventing his release. Copies of the tape were delivered to two Western news agencies in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> four days after <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, spent a fourth birthday in captivity. They were accompanied by a statement in Arabic from <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>, which holds <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> denied his administration impeded the release of the hostages. `` I do n't think that was <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> speaking,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of the videotape. `` I think he had a script that was given to him.'' He president added: `` We have been doing everything we can for the release of the hostages, and the very simple answer is, for those people, to let them go.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said the kidnappers were trying to influence the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> election. `` This is a cynical attempt to use the hostages to influence public opinion and the only real answer is for them to release the hostages immediately,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` It's not clear what they are trying to achieve, but its's obviously meant to influence the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- election.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> began his message, which lasted two minutes and 35 seconds, by identifying himself and saying the date was Oct. 30. `` Once again I have been given the chance to speak to my government, my family and my people,'' said the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I love you, I miss you very much. I know of your continued strong efforts for me,'' he told friends and family. `` I have been very close to being released several times over the past three years, but each time it seems that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government uses its influence to stop any agreement and I do n't understand this `` I am not asking <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to deal with terrorists, although Mr. -LRB- George -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did so in the Iran-Contra affair and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking.'' He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president, has not previously been named as a negotiator in the 1985 jet hijacking, in which Shiite Moslems demanding freedom for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> prisoners held 39 Americans for 17 days. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> released 766 prisoners. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s statement about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` totally incorrect, wrong.'' The vice president has said he was not a key player in the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and was unaware of details and planning of it. The deal became known as the Iran-Contra affair when it was revealed that money for the arms was funneled to Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` Our problem could have been solved a long time ago without such complications as arms deals,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. He urged the administration to negotiate his release and appealed to the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to end the plight of the hostages. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said it wo n't negotiate with terrorists. It was the third videotaped message from <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> since his abduction in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. The other tapes were released Oct. 3, 1986, and Dec. 24, 1987. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is the longest-held foreign hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. There are 14 captives, including nine Americans. Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, said in an accompanying statement that it provided the videotape `` on the occasion of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s birthday and in response to your letters, and according to his desire to send you a recorded message.'' Islamic Jihad also holds <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, acting dean of agriculture at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He was kidnapped June 10, 1985. The group is demanding, among other things, freedom for fellow `` holy warriors'' from all foreign jails and withdrawal of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It repeated those demands in a statement Oct. 23. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> appeared relaxed as he read from the prepared statement. He was cleanshaven and wore eyeglasses. His hair was cut short and neatly combed. He was shown from the waist up, wearing a striped gray sweater. `` I am well and being well treated and I received your birthday greetings and as always I thank you very much,'' he said. Letters from family members and colleagues appeared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers last week, and state-run television broadcast a one-minute film Thursday of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s 3-year-old daughter, Sulome, singing `` Happy Birthday.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said: `` As my fourth birthday in captivity passes and the end of my fourth year in captivity approaches, I find it difficult to keep my hope and courage high. `` The news I hear tells me that I have not been forgotten and will not be, but the difficulty seems enormous.'' `` I heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious efforts to free three trapped whales a few days ago and the president's thanks to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for its help. It is a warming story,'' he said. `` That kind of cooperation and spirit is absolutely necessary to bring this situation to an end.'' To his family, he said: `` Peg, <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> and Dad, kiss my daughters for me. Keep your spirits up and I will try to do the same and one day soon, God willing, this will end.'' The reference to `` Dad'' indicates <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> does not know his father died in 1986. `` Peg'' is <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, and `` Madeleine'' is Sulome's mother. Islamic Jihad has freed three Americans in the last three years _ the Rev. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON>, a Presbyterian minister, the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, former directer of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>'s release Nov. 2, 1986, was connected to the shipment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 A 19-foot-tall King Tut mask, 200 old-time music machines and a 1597 map of the New World are testing college administrators' ingenuity in finding uses for the sometimes odd gifts of well-meaning alumni. The one-ton King <PERSON> Tut </PERSON> mask was donated to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> two years ago by a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> developer who was an Ole Miss grad. The mask had hung in a building sold by the developer, said university spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lago </PERSON>. The school has put the disassembled bronze, copper and aluminum mask in storage for possible use in the foyer of a new library now under consideration, <PERSON> Lago </PERSON> said. `` We've had all kinds of gifts given to us,'' the school's development director, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fruge </PERSON>, said `` We even had somebody build a 2 million gallon reservoir on our golf course to provide water for irrigation.'' The music machines, part of collection valued at $ 500,000, were donated to <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> last year by a 1949 graduate who once played in the school's band. The music machines and other memorabilia dating to the Civil War will be put on public display. More than 20,000 pieces of sheet music also included in the collection will be used for research by music students, school officials said. The 400-year-old map was donated to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Hattiesburg </LOCATION> insurance adjuster and his wife. `` The library has been the beneficiary of so many gifts from them over the past 30 years, they've dubbed it the <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> collection,'' assistant public relations director <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> said. Among the Rileys' gifts: old books and a 1962 mechanical pencil. All have been put on display. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Guest </PERSON>, a development assistant at Ole Miss, said the gifts, referred to as in-kind donations because they do not involve money, sometimes are extremely valuable. The King Tut mask, for example, is worth about $ 100,000. `` It does n't represent a significant portion of the school's budget, however,'' Guest said `` I really ca n't give a number because we may get one really valuable gift every five years.'' Some in-kind gifts, however, do generate income. Three acres of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> real estate was bequeathed to Ole Miss in 1986 by an alumnus. A Bonanza steakhouse and a gas station sit on the property and the school now receives rent from the two businesses, <PERSON> Fruge </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tougaloo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a private school in central <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, receives a portion of the purse from an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> breeder every time a horse of the same name wins. So far this year, the school has gotten nearly $ 11,400.

<TEXT>
 The chief judge at the trial of confessed <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said Monday the court wants the defendant's parents to testify at the proceedings. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is charged with air piracy and murder in the June 14, 1985, hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight 847, which was diverted to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after it left <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Thirty-nine people were held hostage 17 days, and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was murdered. `` We still do n't know when we'll be able to hear <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s parents,'' said Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> They are believed to be living in the west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> neighborhood of <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Barajneh </PERSON>. The trial, which began July 5, has focused heavily on the Shiite Moslem hijacker's childhood in war-torn <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The parents' testimony could help the court to determine <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s age at the time the hijacking began Court records show <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was born June 13, 1964, which would make him 21 at the time of the hijacking. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has said he is at least two years younger. On Monday, anthropologist <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunter </PERSON>, 48, told the court he studied medical X-rays of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> taken in <LOCATION> Saarlouis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the defendant lived from 1982 to 1984 before returning to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The expert said he analyzed the development of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s elbow and his collarbone. `` From the information I have studied, I would say the birth year is 1965, plus or minus a half year,'' <PERSON> Kunter </PERSON> said. Depending on the court's decision on <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s age, his maximum prison sentence, if convicted, would range from 15 years to life in prison. In other testimony Monday, psychiatrist <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ploeger </PERSON> testified hijack victims often suffer long-term psychological disorders as a result of their ordeal. <PERSON> Ploeger </PERSON> told the court that one of the former victims of a 1977 hijacking of a West German airliner `` still imagines being followed in a car'' by a hijacker. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in January 1987 after customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage, told the court he had no comments on Monday's testimony. The defendant told the court in earlier sessions he took part in the hijacking, but he has denied killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. The diver's parents, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, have attended the trial regularly, taking notes and listening attentively to the proceedings. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s attorneys last week asked the court to suspend hearing more witnesses in the case until they can examine evidence compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The court has not yet ruled on the request. Court officials said Monday that more former passengers on the hijacked flight were expected to testify this week. <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> canceled Tuesday's session due to a death in the family of one of the jurors.

 The <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> journalists' union has sharply denounced political interference in the press and demanded greater freedom, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Monday. Journalists attending an annual conference in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> last week issued a statement saying the union `` is opposed to all pressures exerted on journalists and editorial offices and rejects any form of repression of the written word,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>. The conference earlier had dropped from the union's statutes a requirement for journalists to be `` committed to the principles of Marxism-Leninism.'' The phrase was replaced by a call for members to `` support socialist self-management,'' the participation by workers in the management of their own companies. `` The further democratization of our society will not be possible without the ... independent participation of journalists in keeping the public informed about the functioning of the system,'' the journalists said. Although the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> media is far more independent than in any other communist state, some journalists have been fired for failing to support official policies. Several dozen reporters and editors, mostly in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, have been removed from their jobs this year for allegedly criticizing <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> bosses The circulation of the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> magazine <ORGANIZATION> NIN </ORGANIZATION>, once the country's most authoritative political weekly, has plummeted since its editor-in-chief and several journalists were purged earlier this year for opposing <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> In July, a military court in the northern republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> convicted three journalists from the youth magazine <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON> of disclosing military secrets and sentenced them to prison terms ranging from five to 18 months.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will prosecute 36 people in six states for trading in parrots illegally smuggled into the country. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have agreed to seek indictments against people it believes have been buying parrots from smugglers who sneak them across the Mexican border near <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Megan </PERSON> <PERSON> Durham </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the service. Because indictments were still being sought, she declined to identify the communities in which the defendants live. Two already have been sentenced to prison, she said. Most of the defendants will be retail or wholesale dealers, she said. Sellers of the birds, she said, `` chop down trees in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to get baby birds, and many of these were smuggled across the border as babies.'' Some of the birds are protected by a treaty which outlaws international trade in them without permission of both the exporting and importing countries, or that outlaws trade in officially listed endangered species. Violation carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. Following a two-year inquiry, investigators concluded that as many as 26,000 birds a year may be imported illegally, the service said. Investigators seized planes, vehicles and birds worth $ 468,000. These included the thick-billed parrot, an endangered species in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and thus illegal to import; and the black palm cockatoo and the scarlet macaw, illegal to import without permits from the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the exporting country. Also, the double yellow-head <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> parrot and the Mexican red-head parrot, which may not be imported without export permits from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In addition, yellow-nape parrots and red-lored parrots were seized because they were imported without undergoing quarantine, Ms. <PERSON> Durham </PERSON> said. Parrots may carry <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION>'s disease, a highly contagious viral disease that can infect poultry, the service said. The service has received complaints of the illegal trade for some time, but has had trouble making cases because dealers claimed their birds were bred in captivity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, service Director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The illegal dealers commonly believed that once they got the smuggled birds away from the border they would not be caught,'' <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> said. `` Operation Psittacine -LRB- from psittacus, Latin for parrot -RRB- is the first major covert effort by the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to target illegal parrot dealers operating away from the borders.''

<TEXT>
 A hospital ignored state laws that encourage `` good Samaritan'' acts by firing a dormitory housemother who gave shelter to a battered wife, a lawyer argued Monday. The former housemother, <PERSON> Sallyanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, is seeking unspecified damages and back pay from <LOCATION> Northeastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in a civil lawsuit that went to trial Monday in Common Pleas Court. Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> testified that she was fired from her part-time job as housemother at a dormitory for the hospital's female nursing students after she opened the dormitory doors late one night to a woman who was crying that she had been beaten by her husband and needed the police. Hospital officials testified that Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was fired for violating rules that prohibited her from doing anything that might endanger the safety of the dormitory residents, including admitting unauthorized visitors after curfew. Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Chomsky </PERSON>, argued that the hospital decision was based on an `` unreasonable'' fear that the woman posed a danger and that the hospital failed to give housemothers guidelines for handling emergencies. During the opening arguments, Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Prattis </PERSON> said there was no question that state laws encourage giving assistance to abuse victims, but said that does not provide an excuse for violating rules established by employers. When Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was on the stand, <PERSON> Prattis </PERSON> asked her if she would have let in a teen-age boy who came to the door with bruises and said he was abused. Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said she would, to which <PERSON> Prattis </PERSON> replied, `` I believe you would.'' `` And that, Ms. <PERSON> Chomsky </PERSON>, is your problem,'' the judge said. Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also testified that a hospital security guard was present Dec. 13, 1987, when she let the woman in, and that the guard stayed until police came for the woman. Dr. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON>, director of nursing education at the hospital, said Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> would have been disciplined regardless of whether a guard was present. Ms. <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> said the dormitory housemother has the responsibility for controlling who comes into the building after curfew, and that hospital rules prohibited the entrance of unauthorized people. Ms. <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> said she recommended that Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> be fired because of the rules violation and because she no longer trusted Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s judgment.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> began its investigation Monday into a refinery explosion and fire that killed two people and badly burned two others, but did not expect to pinpoint a cause for some time, spokesmen said. The injured workers remained hospitalized in critical condition Monday with third-degree burns. Sunday's explosion and fire at the refinery was the third this year at the complex south of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Company spokeswoman <PERSON> Elise </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> refused discuss the investigation or the possible cause of the accident. Results would not be available `` for quite some time,'' she said. The company planned to interview workers, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> was hospitalized at <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, with third-degree burns over 65 percent of his body. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zivich </PERSON>, 44, of <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> was at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> with third-degree burns over 30 percent to 40 percent of his body. The explosion at the No. 3 oxydizer unit, which makes industrial asphalt for paving and roofing, instantly killed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>, 44, of <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, a 17-year veteran of the refinery. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusbel </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Whiting </LOCATION>, a shift supervisor with 14 years' experience, died of burns six hours after the accident There were no other injuries. Hospital emergency room workers had to cut through hardened asphalt up to a half-inch thick on the victims' bodies. The accident tied the death toll from an explosion and fire in 1955 that also injured 35 people and destroyed 70 storage tanks and 200 homes. This year, on April 16, an explosion and small fire in a processing unit injured 16 workers. Two men were hurt Oct. 6 in a fire and explosion at a refinery unit where chemicals are added to jet fuel. A December 1984 fire destroyed two bulk storage tanks and forced the evacuation of about 100 people.

<HEAD>Genealogists Say Castle Site Could Have Been Camelot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ruins of a castle owned by generations of a Scottish <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family could have been King Arthur's Camelot, a genealogist said Monday. <PERSON> Greenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON>, high on the <LOCATION> Ayrshire </LOCATION> cliffs of southwest <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, was built on the site of a 6th century fort that `` matches almost exactly'' the description and location of a fortress in Arthurian legend, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON>. Although the story of King <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and his court at <LOCATION> Camelot </LOCATION> are legend, historians believe there probably was a British ruler named <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> who fought <PERSON> Saxon </PERSON> invaders from what is now the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and the north German coast. The shadowy figure was embellished by storytellers into a chivalrous hero, slayer of monsters, leader of the Knights of the Round Table and seeker of the Holy Grail. <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON>, publishing director of <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s Peerage, said researchers had discovered the castle site was a key military post for King <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and his knights. They made the discovery, he said, while carrying out research to prove that the medieval Scottish barony of <PERSON> Greenan </PERSON> is an active title of nobility. <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a specialist in <LOCATION> Arthuriana </LOCATION>, carried out separate research into the fort's history and believed it was one of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s six castles and `` the most important one from a military point of view,'' <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON> said. He quoted her as saying: `` It was the custom of the king to refer to the castle he was using at the time as ` Camelot.' ... In my opinion, <PERSON> Greenan </PERSON> was one of King Arthur's forts.'' The seventh marquess of <LOCATION> Ailsa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, wants to sell the barony, including the castle site, `` to somebody who will allow the historical research to continue,'' <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON> said. The title of baron is tied to ownership of the land and not to a blood lineage, he said, adding there was likely to be a blood tie between the <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedys </ORGANIZATION> and the Irish <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family from whom the late <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was descended. JFK's term often was referred to as `` Camelot. `` We're trying to establish a blood relationship,'' <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Scientists Develop Way to Produce More Ethanol, Reduce Cost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Biotechnologists have produced a bacteria strain that could greatly increase the supply of ethanol, a potential substitute motor fuel, and reduce its cost, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. `` For the first time, bacteria have been genetically engineered so that they are now able to convert all types of sugars found in plant material into ethanol,'' said <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, professor of microbiology and cell science at the university's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Ethanol is the principal octane booster used in premium-grade gasolines, replacing toxic lead additives, and is considered a possible substitute motor fuel for the future. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said he has changed the genes of a strain of bacteria to produce ethanol from a wider variety of substances. Further development of this process could cut the cost of ethanol production in half and eliminate dependence on cornstarch or cane sugar as a biomass source for ethanol fuel, <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said. Corn starch now represents about 80 percent of the expense in ethanol production. The new process would allow the conversion of cheap biomass composed of diverse sugars into ethanol, <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said. `` It is now possible to convert inedible vegetable waste, stalks, stems, leaves and woody materials into ethanol, a clean-burning fuel which can be used to reduce air pollution and our need for foreign oil,'' he said. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> and his team are not the only scientists working on the ethanol problem. But researchers have always failed to design a bacterium that can produce enough ethanol to make the process profitable. `` If the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> work is to be a major breakthrough, it will have to be rapid production with high concentrations of ethanol,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bungay </PERSON>, an ethanol expert and professor of chemical engineering at <ORGANIZATION> Rensselaer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bungay </PERSON> defined high concentration as `` above 4 -LCB- percent.'' That means at least 4 -LCB- percent of the mass digested by the bacteria would have to be converted into ethanol. `` We can achieve 4 -LCB- percent without any trouble at all,'' <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said. The development was made possible by cloning the genes for the ethanol digestive tract from the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis and inserting these into the bacterium Escherichia coli -LRB- E. coli -RRB-. The research is to be presented at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in March 1989, the school said.

<TEXT>
 A family who found asbestos insulation throughout their home ca n't sell the house, ca n't afford to renovate it, and contractors refuse to tear it down, and their insurance company wo n't pay a penny. The Selphs have abandoned their home of 14 years and along with it, most of their asbestos-covered belongings, including toys, furniture and their daughter's college diploma. Even the vacuum cleaner had to be ditched. `` All my pictures _ everything I've had since my kids were babies _ it's all in there, covered with asbestos,'' <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Selph </PERSON> said. `` I feel like we've been living in Pandora's Box.'' It will cost more to have the cancer-causing asbestos removed than the 40-year-old house is worth, and their insurance wo n't cover anything, because it does n't cover that kind of contamination And the Selphs ca n't sell the home unless the asbestos is removed. Contractors refuse to demolish the structure since workers would need to take special precautions, and the hazardous materials ca n't be disposed of in the county landfill `` Some people ask when we'll be moving back in, but they do n't understand the immensity of the problem,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Selph </PERSON> said `` The people in the community have been so nice to us. Churches have had fund-raisers and offerings for us. People have given us gifts, furnishings and clothing.'' Asbestos was commonly used for insulation until the dangers became known, but it was rarely used in the construction of homes. No other homes in <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> have been found to contain asbestos. `` It's very unusual to find asbestos in the walls and ceilings of homes, even homes built around that time,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Palagyi </PERSON>, asbestos coordinator for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION>. When asbestos was used in homes, <PERSON> Palagyi </PERSON> said, it usually was to wrap pipes. The <PERSON> Selph </PERSON>'s troubles began in August when they had a heat pump and ventilation outlets put in. `` I did n't know anything about it until two days after the system was installed and I asked a worker if they could repair some cracks,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Selph </PERSON> said. `` He said he could n't and then told me it was asbestos. I was floored.'' To install the heat pump and vents, employees of <ORGANIZATION> Kinsey </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conditioning </ORGANIZATION> had to cut through walls and the ceiling. That made the asbestos friable, or flaking, and the new system wafted fine asbestos dust throughout the house. Samples of the walls and ceiling were found to be 60 percent to 65 percent asbestos, and <PERSON> Selphs </PERSON> were urged to move out. `` We know it's in our lungs, no doubt about that,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Selph </PERSON> said. `` But we've all had baseline chest X-rays, except my husband, and everything looked fine.'' The family now lives in a rented house a few miles outside of town. They have hired an attorney in hopes of finding some way to pay for the asbestos removal.

<HEAD>Employers Should Prove They Don't Discriminate Sexually, Court
Told</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, examining `` macho'' attitudes in the workplace, was told Monday that employers should be under a heavy burden to disprove sexual stereotyping when charged with discriminating against women. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, representing a woman denied a partnership at one of the nation's leading accounting firms, said employers should be forced to show by `` clear and convincing evidence'' they did not practice bias. Otherwise, <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said, it will be impossible to pierce `` the impenetrable ... smog'' surrounding motives for hiring, firing and promotion decisions made in the `` collegial'' atmosphere of business boardrooms. But <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberly </PERSON>, a lawyer for the accounting firm Price Waterhouse, said there was no solid evidence to show that sexual stereotypin caused the company not to grant a partnership to the former employee, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. `` We have overwhelming evidence of legitimate motives,'' Ms. <PERSON> Oberly </PERSON> said. She said lower court rulings in favor of Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> were like a football game in which one side wins without even crossing midfield. `` The plaintiff must bring the ball over the 50-yard line,'' Ms. <PERSON> Oberly </PERSON> said. The justices, who heard 60 minutes of arguments in the case, are expected to announce a ruling by July. Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> quit Price Waterhouse, one of the nation's `` big eight'' accounting firms, after she was denied promotion to partnership in 1983 _ a move that would have made her a part owner. She later became a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> had joined Price Waterhouse in 1978 and was nominated for partnership in 1982, the only woman among 88 candidates for partnership that year. She had been successful in getting business for the company, winning government contracts worth between $ 34 million and $ 44 million. According to court documents, both her critics and supporters at Price Waterhouse said she sometimes was overly aggressive, too harsh, impatient with her staff and very demanding. One critic suggested she needed to take a `` course at charm school.'' A partner who supported her for promotion told her she would stand a better chance of getting ahead if she would `` walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled and wear jewelry,'' the documents said. Ms. <PERSON> Oberly </PERSON> said Monday that the comment was made by Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' strongest supporter at Price Waterhouse It was `` his personal reaction. He was not the decision-maker'' on her promotion, she said. There is `` no linkage between those comments and the -LRB- alleged -RRB- discrimination,'' Ms. <PERSON> Oberly </PERSON> said. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> asked whether there `` is any statement in the record'' rebutting the charge that she would do better by being `` less macho.'' Ms. <PERSON> Oberly </PERSON> said that was not the point of her argument. `` That's my point,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, back on the bench after breast cancer surgery 10 days ago, also took an active part in questioning the lawyers. She asked whether `` maybe the burden -LRB- of proof -RRB- shifts at some time to the employer'' to disprove sexual stereotyping charges. Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> sued Price Waterhouse on grounds it violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibiting on-the-job discrimination. She said sexual stereotyping, unconscious or otherwise, cost her a partnership. Professional partnerships are covered by the 1964 law under a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ruled in 1987 that if there were mixed motives in denying Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> a partnership Price Waterhouse was unable to prove that `` impermissible bias was not the determinative factor'' for the decision. The appeals court ordered further hearings to determine what remedies were due Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> and what the penalties should be against the accounting firm. The case is Price Waterhouse vs. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, 87-1167.

Exports are down, and this year's harvest far exceeds projected cotton use in 1988-89, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said the established target price for upland cotton will be 73.4 cents per pound and that the price support loan level will be 50 cents per pound for the base quality of upland cotton. There will be no paid `` land-diversion'' for idling land under the 1989 program, he said.

 When members of the <ORGANIZATION> Acting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> heard of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>'s death, they were doing what they do for much of the year _ acting on the road. The touring repertory company, founded by <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, appearing in the 1940s comedy `` Boy Meets Girl'' at the Repertory Theater of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The troupe of actors, currently 10 men and five women, was a special joy for <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>, the author, director, actor and producer who died Monday at the age of 86. It was an idea born during <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>'s leadership at the Drama Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Juilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a job he held for eight years. `` The idea of creating of a company out of a school really is n't a unique one,'' <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> said Monday `` We had n't planned to do it but our first class was so astounding. They had created this incredible ensemble as well as being individually talented.'' The seed for the Acting Company blossomed in December 1971 when fourth year students in the Drama Division presented a four-day festival of theater. It was diverse program by the school's first graduating class and included such work as `` The Lower Depths,'' `` The School for Scandal,'' `` Women Beware Women'' and `` The Indian Wants the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>.'' The critics cheered, and <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> decided to put into motion a plan that had been percolating in the back of his mind for some time _ a permanent, touring repertory company, made up of Juilliard graduates. `` The Acting Compay fulfills a very important dual function,'' <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> four years ago. `` It provides pretty good performances of important plays and does them all over the country, even in places that never get any theater, except what we bring them. `` And it fulfills a secondary function, which, in a way, has become equally important,'' he said. `` It's a training ground for young star actors. The results are extraordinary.'' Graduates of the Acting Company continue to make their mark in the theater, movies and television. The first troupe included <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON>, Broadway's `` Evita'' and currently starring at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in a revival of `` Anything Goes.'' <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, the dashing pirate king of `` The Pirates of Penzance'' and the looney con man of the film `` A Film Called Wanda'' also was a member of the initial company. Today, you can find other talented Acting Company alums everywhere _ like <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, a leading player on television's `` As the World Turns''; <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> in the latest <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> film `` Another Woman'' and the new <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> revival of `` Our Town''; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiers </PERSON>, also in the <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> movie as well as a star at the Old Globe Theater in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Banes </PERSON> on Broadway in <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s comedy `` Rumors.''

<HEAD>October Prices for Farm Products Up 13 Percent Over Year Earlier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices farmers got for raw products in October held steady at their late-summer level but still averaged 13 percent more than they did a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its preliminary report that higher prices for oranges, milk, lettuce and corn were offset by lower prices for tomatoes, apples, eggs and soybeans. Meanwhile, prices paid by farmers to meet expenses _ a figure computed only every three months _ rose 1.2 percent from July and averaged 5.5 percent more than a year ago. Farmers paid more for feeder cattle and calves than they did in July, but feed and fuels were lower, the report said. Prices received by farmers for some major commodities are based on mid-month averages and then are revised the following month when additional information is available. The revised figures showed the leveling off actually began in September when the price index held steady at its August average. The preliminary reading for October continued at the August-September level. Prices of raw farm commodities began rising in May as the drought worsened and continued climbing in June, July and August, an increase of about 11 percent from last April. After holding steady during most of last winter, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> index rose 3.1 percent from April to May, followed by June, 2.2 percent; July 2.9 percent; and August 2.1 percent. The drought and searing heat during the spring and summer cut 1988 harvest prospects sharply and triggered the midyear price rise. Total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain production is expected to be down 31 percent from last year's harvest. Despite the leveling of the overall price index, some commodities continued higher in October. Wheat, for example, rose an additional 14 cents per bushel to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm price average of $ 3.89 per bushel, the most since it was $ 3.95 in May 1981. Prices of livestock and livestock products as a group were unchanged from September, although dairy products gained 3.1 percent during the month and the index for poultry and eggs declined 5 percent. Compared with October 1987, the index was up 4.1 percent. The department's all-crops price index for October, although unchanged from September, was up 27 percent from a year earlier. Prices of feed grain and hay as a group rose 1.5 percent from September and averaged 62 percent more than in October 1987. Prices of commercial vegetables were down 5 percent from September but were still 8.2 percent more than a year ago. Although the projections are subject to change, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion this year, compared with the record level of $ 57.1 billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses during the calendar year. Department economists are holding to an earlier prediction that consumer food prices will rise 3 percent to 5 percent this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987. Before the drought took hold, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> was predicting a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent. Some <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials also have predicted that the drought may add 2 percentage points to food prices in 1989, above the expected increase in inflation, currently forecast at around 4 percent. That could mean a 1989 food price increase in the range of 6 percent to 7 percent. The report said: _ Cattle averaged $ 67.90 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $ 67.20 in September and $ 62.90 reported for October 1987 Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef. _ Hogs averaged $ 39.40 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 40.70 in September and $ 48.90 a year earlier _ Corn, at $ 2.71 a bushel, was up from $ 2.60 in September and the average of $ 1.55 per bushel a year earlier _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $ 3.89 per bushel, compared with $ 3.75 in September and $ 2.62 a year earlier _ Rice averaged $ 7.15 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 6.82 in September and $ 5.88 a year earlier _ Soybeans were $ 7.71 per bushel, compared with $ 7.94 in September and $ 5.04 a year earlier _ Upland cotton was reported at 50 cents per pound, compared with 51.8 in September and 65.1 cents in October 1987 _ Eggs were 58.7 cents per dozen, compared with 63.8 cents in September and 50.2 cents a year earlier _ Milk was $ 12.80 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 12.40 in September and $ 12.90 a year earlier _ Broilers were 37.5 cents per pound, live weight, compared with 39.2 cents in September and 25.1 cents a year ago

<HEAD>Los Angeles Best Real Estate Market, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite its traffic congestion, smog, `` ridiculously high housing prices'' and regulatory barriers, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> rates as the best market for real estate investments, a study said Monday. It listed <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> among `` places to be avoided.'' The pluses of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ economic diversity, job growth, climate, quality of life and access to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> _ outweigh its minuses, says the report. `` Indeed, growth restriction is one of the things that attracts investors to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and to the other top-ranked areas,'' the report says. `` Developers complain, often bitterly, of the hassles, expense and risk, but they are increasingly resigned to them and willing to accept the responsibilities in return for unsurpassed development opportunities, less competition, and upside profits.'' The study drops <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from its `` most bullish'' list but retains <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, saying that housing costs in those cities are a barrier to continued high levels of commercial construction. `` Fewer and fewer people can afford to live in or near those centers, and that will take its toll on economic expansion,'' said the report. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is just too expensive and many firms ca n't justify the rent. <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the study, said it sees <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` as a premier market that will return to favor as its inherent strengths prevail over herd instincts.'' The `` to be avoided'' list includes <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>. `` Any meaningful turnaround is still a year or so off in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and two to three years in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, a much smaller market needs a year-or-two respite. When it does come back, it wo n't be to the level of the early'80s.'' The study was done for <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, a property investment firm. It said there are fewer `` best'' markets than in the past and that `` no city or region offers good prospects across the board.'' Here is what the report said of other cities as real estate investment opportunities: <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>: `` Overbuilt in every property type. Speculative S & amp; L-financed land deals, apartments and office space are in seriously long supply. The <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> economy is slow and steady -LRB- resort pizazz notwithstanding -RRB- and needs three years to rebuild enough momentum to justify new starts.'' <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>: `` share the distinction of receiving about as many positive votes as negatives.'' On the plus side: `` the Japanese have discovered both cities.'' On the minus side: `` Huge quantities of office space, hotel rooms, and retail GLA -LRB- gross leasable areas -RRB- are in place, in the pipeline, and on the drawing boards ... vacancies will increase in both <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Major problems can be headed off only by disciplined cutbacks in new starts. Do n't bet on that happening in either city.''

 The multibillion-dollar merger of <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. could harm consumers, Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said Monday in calling on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to launch an antitrust investigation <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, called for the inquiry in a letter directed to <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, in which the senator said food prices could go higher if the merger is allowed to go through. By creating the second largest food company in the world the merger could seriously affect competition and sale of prepared foods, said <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business rights. <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said the agency would not comment on whether it was looking into the merger. The proposed $ 13.1 billion buyout of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> would create the world's largest consumer products company. The planned merger, announced Sunday, would create a $ 40 billion-a-year company armed with some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best-known consumer products, including <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> beer, Marlboro cigarettes, Jell-O, <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> coffee, Velveeta cheese, Parkay margarine, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> cream cheese, Miracle Whip salad dressing and Sealtest ice cream.

<HEAD>Soviets Counter U.S. Claim on Embassy Construction With Own Claim</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Soviet official said Monday that claims against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for delays in erecting the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> exceed the $ 29 million <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is demanding for an unfinished, allegedly bugged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. A Swedish official said Monday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claim will go to an arbitration board in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> which has quietly dealt with <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> disputes for 20 years. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said last Thursday he was recommending tearing down the main office building of the new <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> compound in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> because the building was riddled with Soviet eavesdropping devices. His administration is not permitting the Soviets to occupy their new building in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> while the status of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> building remains unsettled. Soviet officials deny the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is bugged, and on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told a news conference: `` We also have bills to present to the American side.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said claims for late delivery of construction materials and equipment and for other troubles would surpass the amount sought by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ulf </PERSON> <PERSON> Franke </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We have been informed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that they are preparing an arbitration -LRB- case -RRB- here in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. The next step is to appoint the arbitrators.'' `` The case is well prepared and it might start any day.'' His organization is the parent body of the <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Franke </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government invoked a clause in the 1977 building contract for the embassy construction in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, in which either side can refer a dispute to the <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> institute. The ruling of the panel is binding. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claim against the Soviets is for damage and defective construction. No figure has been established for any bugging of the building. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said the building will be torn down and a new embassy will be contructed with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers and materials. Direct talks between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have failed to settle the dispute. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said last week they would ask outside arbiters to resolve it. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> was founded 70 years ago and began dealing with international cases in the 1960s. Its reputation for secrecy has brought it a growing number of cases. The case will be heard by three arbitrators, one chosen by each side and a chairman picked by the board from a list of leading Swedish legal experts.

 Actor and director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>, who died Monday, was praised by colleagues as a gentleman whose wit and good manners made him a delight to work with both in front of the floodlights and behind. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>, 86, nurtured some of the nation's best-known actors as a producer, director and teacher, from <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. But it was his turn to acting when he was in his 70s that brought him widespread fame. His portrayal of the acerbic law professor in the movie and television series `` The Paper Chase'' led to other appearances on TV and in movies and commercials, most notably for the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>. `` I absolutely loved <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> and working with him was a great treat,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGraw </PERSON>, who co-starred with him in the 1983 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` The Winds of War.'' <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> starred as Dr. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON>, a Jewish scholar who felt he was safe remaining in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the start of World War II. <PERSON> MacGraw </PERSON> played his niece, <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, who remains at his side. In the sequel, `` War and Remembrance,'' which begins on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Nov. 13, their roles are taken over by Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> `` Pug'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> in both `` The Winds of War'' and the sequel, said: `` He was a great gentleman and I was very impressed with him. I'm very sorry he's gone. `` I told him once he gets all the roles I'd like to have and he said, ` And you get all the parts I'd like to have.''' <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, who starred as <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>'s daughter in `` The Paper Chase,'' said: `` He was charming, a total professional and a joy to work with. But what I enjoyed the most was his tremendous wit.'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who worked for producer <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> as the star of `` Two Weeks in Another Town,'' said: `` He was a gentleman of the old school, polite and courtly. He had wonderful manners. He was an unusual character, and I'm going to miss him.'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, his partner and executive producer of `` The Paper Chase'' for the Showtime cable network, said: `` He's probably the greatest human being that I ever met in my lifetime or will ever meet. He was a Renaissance man. ... He was superb at everything he did, as a writer, director, producer, actor, teacher and a thinker. They just do n't make them like that any more.'' As for his crusty roles, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said, `` When you told him he was n't a curmudgeon at all, he'd say, ` Do n't say that, you're ruining my reputation.' <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> worked with <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> for 20 years at The Acting Company, a national touring group that seeks out classically trained young actors. `` He was wonderfully supportive and great fun,'' she said. `` He was somebody who has been responsible, probably, for more people's careers in American theater than any single person, and we're going to miss him very, very much. As producing artistic director of the company, <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> often both directed and produced the company's plays. The group's most recent production, `` Boy Meets Girl,'' which opened Oct. 14 in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, is the first of the troupe's 62 that <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> had been unable to get deeply involved in, Ms. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the company's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>, stricken with cancer of the spine, had n't been able to work for some months, but had remained in good spirits and received visitors until the end, including a group of former students about 10 days ago, Ms. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Winant </PERSON>, a close friend, said: `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> was never expected to die. <PERSON> John </PERSON> has n't -LRB- died -RRB- because he completed in his lifetime his dream _ he established a national repertory company. His real dream, his real care, was for his acting company. That's his legacy. I think that's so remarkable.'' She added: `` He worked right up until the end. He had a great work ethic. He still had that incredible energy and wit and style. At the end he was as gallant and as stylish as he was his whole life.''

 Afghan Prime Minister <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> will visit the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> this week, and anti-communist rebels fighting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government said Monday they would send representatives to the world body. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is expected to adopt a resolution welcoming the Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It has adopted resolutions annually denouncing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 but no debate is set on this year's milder document. <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> is not a member of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has indicated he could be a compromise figure in a broad-based government. But diplomats at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which have supported the rebels, find Sharq unacceptable because of his association with the Afghan government headed by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. The Afghan Mission said <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> would arrive Tuesday and meet with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials. His schedule was not given but he is expected to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Relations in a closed meeting, although not the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, chairman of a seven-member guerrilla alliance, announced in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, that the rebels would send a delegation to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. He reiterated that the rebels want to form an anti-Marxist government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. For the first time in nine years the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> will adopt a resolution on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by consensus _ not a divisive vote _ after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed on the document, diplomats said. Previous resolutions denounced the Soviet military intervention and demanded the troops withdraw. Action on the Afghan resolution is expected to be taken Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Sharq </ORGANIZATION> recently told reporters in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, that both the governing party and rebels lack the trust of the people. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> repeatedly has accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of violating the U.N.-mediated <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> accords by continuing to arm and train the rebels. The accords were signed last April 15 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as guarantors. The rebels did not take part but were represented by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, and at the time the accords were signed had more than 100,000 military personnel there. The agreements provide for the complete withdrawal of those troops by next Feb. 15. They also call for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> not t interference in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. On Monday the 15-member <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> adopted a resolution confirming the formation of a 50-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer force in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to monitor the Soviet troop withdrawal and check for violations. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the Soviets have said the force is too small and that it has failed to investigate complaints charging <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with violations of the accords.

 House incumbents have a nearly 6-to-1 edge over their opponents in fund raising, including a twelvefold advantage in garnering contributions from special interest groups, a private study showed Monday. The study by Common Cause, the advocacy organization that is a frequent critic of electoral activities, illustrates one of the major reasons that there has been little turnover in the House in recent elections. Common Cause President <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> said the incumbents' fund-raising edge is creating `` a challenger-proof House of Representatives'' and added, `` The ` people's body' established by our founding fathers is starting to look like <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s life-tenured House of Lords Common Cause, compiling <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> candidates' campaign finance reports from Jan. 1, 1987, through Sept. 30, 1988, found that incumbents had raised $ 136.9 million to $ 25.3 million for challengers during the period. That included a $ 62.4 million to $ 5.3 million margin in funds contributed by PACs, the committees formed by companies, labor unions and other special interest groups. Incumbents had not only outspent their opponents by $ 92 million to $ 20.9 million, but they also had a dramatic $ 79.3 million to $ 3.6 million advantage in cash on hand for the campaign's final weeks. Of the 328 races in which a representative faces a major party opponent on Election Day, incumbents had raised more money than challengers in 323 cases; received more from PACs in 316 instances; outspent their opponents in 315 contests and had more money left in 320 races. Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> incumbents both enjoy mammoth financial advantages over their challengers, although Democrats _ who control the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and thus have more political power _ have the widest edge. On average, Democratic incumbents raised more money in PAC contributions than <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> challengers by $ 166,783 to $ 4,724. <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members accepted an average of $ 132,064 from PACs, compared with $ 31,408 received from PACs by Democratic challengers. Of the 435 House seats, 408 incumbents are seeking re-election, including 80 who face no general election opponent from a major party. In 1986, 98 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members seeking new terms were re-elected. Besides having an easier time raising money, incumbents often represent congressional districts that were drawn to include large numbers of party supporters and in which the lawmaker already has name recognition. They also make use of the perks of their jobs, including their staffs and their ability to introduce bills and help constituents. The 10 House candidates who raised the most money through Sept. 30 are Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, R-Calif., $ 1,286,467; Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., $ 1.228,525; Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, $ 1,222,688; Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, D-Wis., $ 1,146,656, and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 12th District, Also <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, Democratic challenger in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 19th District, $ 1,059,739; Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON>, R-Calif., <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s opponent, $ 941,819; Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, $ 897,265; Rep. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., $ 867,080; and Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>, D-Pa. The 10 top spending <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> candidates are <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, $ 1,169,163; <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1,020,663; <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1,006,549; <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON>, $ 964,325; <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, $ 896,407; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schenken </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s 2nd District, $ 811,674; <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> 40th District, $ 770,564; <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>, $ 761,652; Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, $ 758,648; and <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>, $ 751,083

<HEAD>Britain Orders Two-year Ban on Killing Seals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government announced on Monday a two-year ban on killing or catching common seals in all British territorial waters, with the same protection for gray seals in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. The order, which goes into effect Dec. 1, provides a maximum fine of $ 1,740 for anyone convicted of killing, injuring or capturing the seals. `` This reflects the high level of our concern about the diminishing seal population,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON>, a junior Home Office minister, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. `` It demonstrates once again the determination of this government to take decisive action to protect animals and in particular to conserve the stocks of gray and common seals,'' he said. <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON> said the Home Office issued the order under the Conservation of Seals Act 1970 `` following the recent threat to the British seal population by the canine-type distemper virus.'' A mystery disease, believed by scientists to be similar to the common cold or hoof and mouth disease, killed thousands of common and gray seals in British and European waters earlier this summer. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON>, minister of state for fisheries at the Scottish Office, said the protection ordered for gray seals around <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> was not extended to <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> because the situation there was `` less clear-cut.'' `` At this stage, gray seals do not appear to be significantly affected and in any event they are currently offered protection until the end of the year under close-season restrictions,'' <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON> said. Hunting and trapping of gray and common seals, the species most common in British waters, has been legal but the season was closed for common seals from June 1 to Aug. 31 and from Sept. 1 to Dec. 31 for gray seals.

<HEAD>Search Widens For Teen-age Suspect In Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The search for a teen-ager suspected of slaying a college student whose body was found in her bathtub spread through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Monday as reported sightings flooded the police station of this wary town. `` We've even had people call in sightings that turned out to be farmers walking down dirt roads and of one little girl on a road,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. Tensions had been running high for days in the town of 18,000, especially since published accounts quoting sources as saying the suspect had a fascination with a Halloween horror movie. A cinema agreed to suspend the showing of a new horror film, `` Halloween IV,'' and selectmen voted Friday to hold trick-or-treating in broad daylight Sunday, a day early. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said he has sent out 1,000 photographs of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Branch </PERSON> to other police forces in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Branch, 19, disappeared shortly after the stabbing death of <ORGANIZATION> Greenfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, 18. Her body was discovered in her tub on Oct. 21 by her sister. `` This subject should be considered armed and dangerous,'' said a state police bulletin, according to The Recorder of <LOCATION> Greenfield </LOCATION>. `` Info received ... indicates this subject may kill again.'' The bulletin said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> was stabbed in the back and head with a knife that <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said has not been found. He said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> was not sexually assaulted. The chief described Branch as `` a loner. He was a different type of individual,'' adding: `` A lot of people did n't like the kid.'' He stressed, however, that investigators have found no link between Branch's alleged taste for horror films and the slaying. A state police investigator said sightings were reported as far away as <LOCATION> Enfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, 50 miles to the south of the western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town. Police have searched for Branch since his car was discovered abandoned on a back road in nearby <LOCATION> Buckland </LOCATION> a day after <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>'s body was found Over the weekend, however, a manhunt in <LOCATION> Buckland </LOCATION> was called off because 30 searchers and trained dogs turned up nothing. `` I think it would be very reasonable to assume Branch has gone from the area,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. `` Twenty-five hours elapsed between the time of the murder and the time we found his car.'' Newspapers have reported that Branch was a fan of the `` Friday the 13th'' movie series, in which a character named <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> committed a Halloween night massacre. And they cited unnamed sources as saying police found <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> costume paraphernalia in Branch's home, including a hockey goalie mask and black boots. Police have refused to comment on their search and the search warrant they used has been impounded. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said his detectives reviewed the `` Friday the 13th'' movies to try to find a connection with the slaying. Police have no evidence that <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>'s slayer may have acted as <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, `` no paraphernalia left at the scene of the crime, no notes, nothing,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. `` This was a brutal murder, but it had nothing to do with any ritual involving Satanism, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, Friday the 13th.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said he tripled the number of police cars on patrol for Halloween, but expected no trouble. `` I spent four days trying to clear up the fear frenzy that has run rampant in this town,'' he said. `` I think by now the town has come off this fear thing.''

<HEAD>Polls Find Dukakis Rated Better on Crime but Hamstrung in Own
Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' counterattacks have improved his rating as a crimefighter, but the Democratic presidential nominee still suffers from unsteady support within his own party, polls said Monday. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led by 11 points among likely voters in a national survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 52-41 percent, and by seven points, 52-45 percent, in a poll by <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and Associates. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> poll was done in the first half of last week; the <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll was more recent, conducted Friday through Sunday. Its 52-45 result was a very slight narrowing from 53-44 in a <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted Oct. 14-17. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> only recently began to counter <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charges that he was weak on crime, and the <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll indicated some results: Fifty-three percent rated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> soft on crime, still high but down from 63 percent in the earlier poll. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> also indicated that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had scored slightly by portraying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign advertisements as unfair. Seventy-five percent called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ads too negative, while 68 percent said the same of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' ads. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> poll, meanwhile, found support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> uneven within his own party, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> marshalled monolithic backing from Republicans and siphoned away some Democrats. Gallup said the presidential race has been largely stable for months, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead at least since September. But its poll found an underlying factor in his favor: His supporters were more loyal than they had been previously. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, has suffered slow erosion in his popularity, to a point now lower than other candidates in recent years, the poll said. And he lost support in some Democratic groups even while gaining it in others. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead was based upon overwhelming support from Republicans, solid backing from Republican-leaning independents and `` substantial defections'' from some Democratic groups, according to Gallup's analysis of the results. `` For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, on the other hand, his support is not as strong among his own partisans; and he is receiving virtually no defections from members of core Republican groups,'' the analysis said. The survey did find some room for change. Swing voters, those who were undecided or said they might change their minds, made up 27 percent of the likely voters. And only about half of each candidates' supporters backed them strongly. The problem in analyzing the race was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stable lead on one hand versus the softness of both candidates' support on the other. `` If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign can get their act together and speak to their constituencies or potential constituencies, they can win it on the basis of the numbers,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>, Gallup's president. `` But that's a big if, given the course of the campaign so far.'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> poll divides the electorate into 10 evenly sized groups whose members share general values. Its `` partisan poor,'' for example, is a Democratic group; its `` enterprisers'' and `` moralists'' are Republican. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attracted 21 percent of the `` partisan poor,'' in the new survey, significantly poaching in a Democratic stronghold. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, by contrast, drew only 2 percent of the `` enterprisers'' and 3 percent of the `` moralists.'' The last Times-Mirror poll, in September, identified `` disaffected'' voters, set apart by their suspicion of government, as a swing group. After a nearly even division in May, they backed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 61-27 percent last month. In the new survey that preference held steady, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s supporters in the group grew more loyal to him: Fifty-one percent said they were unlikely t switch to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, up from 36 percent last month `` In contrast, on the Democratic side, defections to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have doubled among ` seculars' and significantly increased among the ` partisan poor,''' Gallup said. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offset the losses with gains in other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> groups, it said, the movement was `` indicative of the problems that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has had in achieving enthusiastic support'' from some groups within his own party. Additionally, among all registered voters, not just those likely to vote, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was rated favorably by 48 percent, compared with 58 percent favorable for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The poll analysis said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' rating was `` significantly below'' those of most candidates in recent presidential elections <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> poll was conducted Oct. 23-26 among 2,006 registered voters, of whom 1,505 were considered likely to vote. The error margin for the likely voter group was plus or minus three points. The Harris poll was done among 1,250 likely voters and also had a three-point margin of error. In a state poll Monday, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> put the race in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at 51 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 44 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. That survey was done Saturday and Sunday among 510 likely voters; while the spread was within its margin of error of five points, other recent polls also have found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> slightly ahead there. In a separate poll in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 53 percent to 39 percent among 397 likely voters. The poll was taken last Monday through Thursday and had a margin of error of four points.

 They were all there in spirit at <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s Grill: <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Spade </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Op _ private eyes in a public place, watching from the shadows Monday as would-be writers played trick-or-treat with the ghost of novelist <PERSON> Dashiell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON> The assignment was to ham-up <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s hard-boiled gumshoe-turned-mystery writer who gave us such treasures as `` The Maltese Falcon,'' `` The Thin Man,'' and `` The Big Knockover. About 100 hopefuls entered this `` bad writing'' contest, sending in send-ups from <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and elsewhere. They all ended up at <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s, a swell chop house in a not-so-swell part of town. <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON> used to lap it up at the bar, but he would have had a hard time swallowing the entries read on Monday. They were definitely not the stuff dreams are made of. `` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> was the thinnest man <PERSON> Nora </PERSON>'d ever seen. <LOCATION> Handcuffs </LOCATION> slipped from his wrists up over his head to encircle his waist. He'd gotten out of a lot of tight spots that way ... `` ` Tell me the truth,''' <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> said. ` When you were on the floor wrestling with <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON>, did you have anorexia?'' Oddly enough, that kind of prose was good enough to tie <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> for first with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlach </PERSON>. Both men are <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscans </LOCATION>, both have real jobs and both want to be novelists. <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> got the nod for making an obscure pun. When `` The Thin Man'' was first published in 1934, one line was deleted by censors. <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> really asked <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> if he had `` an erection'' when he wrestled with <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> said his first novel is coming out soon. <PERSON> Vlach </PERSON>, a psychiatrist by trade, described a violent scene where <PERSON> Brigid </PERSON> slams <PERSON> Babe </PERSON> <PERSON> McDougall </PERSON> on the back of his big head with a two-by-four, leaving `` his right eye dangling out of it's socket like'' something that ca n't be described in a family newspaper. <PERSON> Vlach </PERSON> went on nicely: `` She turned to me, the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cop </ORGANIZATION>, and said with a tear dribbling through her eye liner like <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> parting the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, ` You wo n't turn me in. I love you. You love me.' `` I counted the lies in those three sentences, multiplied by three, then opened the door for her pal, little <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Egypt </PERSON> ... When the cops got there I turned them both in. Her because she said she loved me. Him because he called me <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>.'' OK, so these guys are n't going to get Pulitzers. The grand prize package in this public relations gimmick was a bottle of cheap gin, a ham sandwich and a hard-boiled egg. <PERSON> Vlach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> each got their own, so they do n't have to share, but it did n't keep them from feeling like losers. `` I'm pretty disappointed,'' <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> griped. `` All I got was a bottle of cheap gin and a moldy old ham sandwich.'' He apparently forgot about the egg, and the free publicity. Nobody can say the judging was n't fair, although somebody probably will. The three panelists were: <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipset </PERSON>, a real-life detective who's cracked open more cases in 42 years than <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON> could on a lost weekend; <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Herron </PERSON>, who has conducted walking tours through `` <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'' for the past 12 years; and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gores </PERSON>, who wrote the novel `` Hammett'' that inspired the 1982 film of the same name.

 Irate passengers briefly took over three planes within a 24-hour period on Sunday and Monday to protest flight cancellations due to bad weather and equipment, an official of the nation's flag carrier said. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> vice president for public relations, said in a telephone interview the incidents arose from the airport situation at the central city of <LOCATION> Bacolod </LOCATION>, about 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said several flights to <LOCATION> Bacolod </LOCATION> had been canceled or delayed since October because some equipment there had broken down and would give incoming flights `` poor navigational aid.'' He said the first of the three incidents occurred Sunday in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> when a domestic flight bound for <LOCATION> Bacolod </LOCATION> was canceled because of the weather. Upon being informed of the cancellation, about 109 passengers led by an unidentified lawyer took over a plane scheduled to leave for <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> in the south and demanded to be flown to <LOCATION> Bacolod </LOCATION>, he said. The protesting passengers left the plane after 20 minutes, when PAL authorities assured their booking for another flight Monday. Monday's flight left <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> without incident but upon landing at <LOCATION> Bacolod </LOCATION>, the passengers refused to leave the plane and demanded that the airport's radio and runway lights be repaired immediately. The passengers left the plane an hour later after local officials assured them of action on their request, <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said. On a return flight to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, six passengers refused to leave their plane for an hour to protest what they deemed `` an apparent discrimination'' against <LOCATION> Bacolod </LOCATION> airport. They left after being told eight other domestic flights were canceled due to bad weather, <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said PAL officials had not decided whether to file charges against the passengers.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> accused a defunct brokerage firm Monday of using high-pressure, abusive sales tactics to persuade thousands of people across the country to invest in a scheme to turn sand into gold. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> estimated losses from the scheme total $ 300 million nationwide, and at least $ 4 million in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. The commission is seeking to revoke the license of the <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION> Fitzgerald </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> DeArman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and seven of its salesmen and principals, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. The firm's offices have been closed since June, and liquidation proceedings are under way by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a federal agency that insures investor funds in the event of the failure of a brokerage firm.

Even though GoldCor had no gold or other real assets, the price of its stock rose on the over-the-counter market from 3 to 6 cents per share when the scheme began in 1986 to about $ 11 per share before tumbling last February. It is presently at 3 to 9 cents a share, Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. The precipitous drop followed a critical article in the business magazine <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>'s, and a financial statement that showed <PERSON> GoldCor </PERSON> had no revenues, Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. `` The real question is, does this company have any real value at all,'' she said at a state Capitol news conference. She said the $ 300 million in estimated losses was based on the peak price of GoldCor stock before it began dropping in Feburary. `` Probably thousands of people nationwide were touched by it in some way,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>. She said the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has filed a civil lawsuit against GoldCor, but said she was n't aware of any other action involving the company. Up to 14 firms besides <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, <PERSON> DeArman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> were selling GoldCor stock at one time, but `` these were the people who seemed to be pushing it above and beyond what they should have been,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said the firm's salesmen promised investors GoldCor stock would double or triple in price, suggesting they had insider information. At least two of the 65 <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> investors identified so far were retired people who cleaned out their retirement accounts to invest in GoldCor stock, Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. `` These were people who lost money who did n't have it to lose,'' she said. The commission said individual losses in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> from the GoldCor scheme ranged from $ 1,000 to $ 450,000. In addition to revoking licenses, the commission wants to bar the seven individuals from further associating with securities firms in the state. The commission action Monday amounted to a 15-day notice of its intent to take administrative action. `` We'll review the case to see if there should be a referral for criminal prosecution,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said, adding that it is a felony under <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> law to trade securities using false information.

<HEAD>Court Sentences Junta Members for Falklands War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A civilian court stripped Gen. <PERSON> Leopoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>, the former military president, of his rank Monday and sentenced him to 12 years in prison for mismanaging the 1982 Falklands war with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In partial confirmation of an earlier ruling by the highest military tribunal, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> gave the same sentence to the other members of <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>'s junta _ Adm. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> commander, and Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Basilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lami </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozo </PERSON>, who was chief of the air force. The military tribunal's verdict automatically went for review to the civilian appeals court, which can revise civilian or military judicial rulings and even act as a court of first resort. Defense lawyers said the convictions probably will be appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Judge <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cattani </PERSON>, president of the four-member panel, said all three officers were `` equally responsible'' for the `` mistakes, omissions and negligence'' that led to defeat in the 74-day war over the islands <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> calls the Malvinas. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lami </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozo </PERSON> constituted the third military junta to rule after President <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> was deposed in March 1976. Appeals court judges acquitted three other officers who were instrumental in carrying out the war _ <PERSON> Gens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Parada </PERSON>, and Vice Adm. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardo </PERSON>, all now retired. The case stems from the junta's decision to invade the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> islands April 2, 1982, and the conduct of the war until <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> surrendered his troops on June 14 at <LOCATION> Stanley </LOCATION>, capital of the Falklands. In May 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> convicted <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lami </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozo </PERSON> of negligence and incompetence, sentencing them to 12, 14 and 8 years in jail respectively and stripping them of rank. <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Parada </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lombardo </PERSON> and seven other officers were acquitted. <PERSON> Cattani </PERSON>, president of the appeals panel, said sentences for the three junta members were made identical because doing otherwise risked `` inciting the protagonists, in the case of a similar conflict, to act independently ... losing sight of the fact that ... only a joint action would make possible a victory.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> alleged when the appeal began July 26 that the armed forces were ill-trained, poorly led, and acted independently of each other. He focused on <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>'s decision to withdraw the navy from combat after a British submarine sank the cruiser Belgrano in May 1982, and the failure of <PERSON> Parada </PERSON>, who commanded army troops on the islands, to establish a command post. Officers called by the prosecution testified <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> did not believe <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would fight to regain the islands or that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would help the British. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>, 62, claimed <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> almost won the war and charges of mismanagement were unfounded. In an emotional defense Oct. 17, he said, `` Would I do it again? Given the same circumstances and conditions, would I proceed in the same manner? The answer is yes. I, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> would proceed the same way as I did.'' <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has claimed the islands since 1810, the year it asserted independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has ruled them since 1833. The chilly, windswept archipelago is home to about 1,900 sheepherders and fishermen. Possession conveys rights to natural resources, including abundant fishing fields and possible oil deposits.

 President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> met Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> on Monday in the first of two sessions scheduled for his three-day visit to the island nation, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said.

Thousands of Cubans greeted de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> at the airport Monday and <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'s streets were decorated with welcoming banners, the dispatch, monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, reported.

 The Democrats are touting record-breaking fund raising for the 1988 election with $ 50 million, but they still have n't caught up to the traditionally richer Republican party. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and its state-based `` Victory'88'' program have raised some $ 92 million, finance director <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> announced it has surpassed its fund-raising goal of $ 50 million at $ 50.3 million, the most the national party has ever raised for an election. In 1984, the party raised $ 24 million, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anbender </PERSON>. Both parties have engaged in an all-out effort to raise so-called soft money, which consists of contributions that would not be allowed in the federal election process but can be used by the parties for generic and state-related election activity that ends up indirectly benefiting the presidential candidates. For candidates seeking election to the presidency or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the law limits individual contributions to $ 1,000 and bars corporate and union funds, all of which can be accepted by the parties themselves. In the general election, no private contributions are permitted for presidential candidates because they receive $ 46 million from the taxpayer-supported public fund to wage their campaigns. In addition, each national party can spend $ 8.3 million on its presidential nominee. The parties are collecting millions on top of that. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s Victory Fund'88, said the party's $ 50 million had come from 325,000 donors, with an average contribution of $ 154. However, the party also received contributions of $ 100,000 or more from 142 individuals, said <PERSON> Anbender </PERSON>. Direct mail brought in some $ 300,000 a day, for $ 18 million of the $ 50 million total, the party said in a news release, while more than 75 large fund-raising events brought in another $ 18 million. On the Republican side, more than 125 contributors gave $ 100,000 or more as part of the `` Team 100'' program, said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The Republicans' `` Victory'88'' program, in which money goes directly to state-level party organizations, has surpassed its goal of $ 25 million, raising $ 27 million so far, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, have helped that fund substantially by appearing several times a week at high-ticket fund-raising events out on the campaign trail. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> mail in the past two weeks has produced more than $ 300,000 a day, with an average $ 25 contribution. He called it `` a boom'' the likes of which he has not seen since 1980. `` It's been very easy,'' to raise money since August, he said, contending that people are reacting out of fear of what they foresee as bad economic conditions should <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> win the election.

 Investigation of a plane accident that left actress <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> and her family doused with jet fuel was delayed Monday as crews worked to free the jet's nose from the side of another plane. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigator <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Feith </PERSON> said he spent the weekend at <LOCATION> Pitkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> examining the jet, which aborted takeoff Saturday and crashed into two parked airplanes.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> ordered Monday that all `` problem'' place names that represent racial, ethnic or religious epithets be eliminated from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state maps. An executive order from <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s office directed that all state agencies refer potentially offensive geographical names to the state Committee on Geographical Names. And he said derogatory names should be eliminated from maps prepared for and by the state. `` Derogatory names have no place in the <ORGANIZATION> Empire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, and we must act at the state level to ensure that such names are removed forever from the maps New Yorkers use,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> took the action in response to the long-time use of `` Nigger Swamp'' on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> maps to a region of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> along the shore of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Champlain </LOCATION>. The region was so dubbed in the 1830s, according to legend, after a black barge worker suffering from smallpox was put ashore there to die. The use of that term by <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION> officials, who said the area would be stocked with pheasants, was news to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> when reported last month by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` Obviously, we did n't know about this,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> told the newspaper. `` And now that we do know we will do everything possible to get rid of this ugly reminder of a time when people were less intelligent than they are now.'' His order does not affect mapmakers outside state government. The Committee on Geographical Names was created by the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION> to establish `` correct'' place names in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, based on historical and etymological considerations.

<TEXT>
 Residents of <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, who did not allow dogs from 1924 until an experiment began four years ago, have decided to do without them again. In a week-long referendum that attracted 12.8 percent of the eligible voters, 60.2 percent voted against continuing the experiment. The results were announced Sunday night. Mayor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Oddsson </PERSON>, a dog owner, said people who have permits for dogs will be allowed to keep them until the animals die. Dogs were banished from this city of 88,000 people in 1924 after an outbreak of dog-related diseases. A compromise in 1984 set rules for the keeping of dogs during a four-year experimental period, while leaving the ban on the statute books. Under those rules, <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>'s 850 registered dog-owners pay yearly license fees equivalent to $ 120, each dog must have an annual medical checkup and owners must carry insurance. No dogs are allowed in the city's central district. They must stay out of public parks between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. and can not enter any public building, restaurant, playground, bus or barbershop. Leashes are required at all times. Of the 68,570 eligible voters, 8,777 participated in the referendum. The vote was 5,279 to ban dogs and 3,454 to continue the 1984 program.

 A woman who admitted plotting a toy giveaway with some of the $ 7.1 million stolen from <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 was sentenced Monday to five years in prison. <PERSON> Luz </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON>, 38, an occupational therapist from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, received the maximum prison term, but was spared a $ 10,000 fine for her guilty plea in September to a charge of conspiracy to transport stolen money. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> said a fine would be pointless because `` this lady is indigent for all intents and purposes.'' Her attorney, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieselman </PERSON>, asked that <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> be sent to the federal minimum security prison in <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, noting that she is just a few weeks pregnant and needs to be near her family. But <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> said that because <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> is pregnant, the best prison for her would be in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, Ky. The judge, however, said he would let Wieselman see if arrangements could be made at <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>. On the day a jury was to be picked for her trial, <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> admitted to conspiring with others in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to send between $ 5,000 and $ 12,000 to <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> to pay for toys given away on Jan. 6, 1985, Three Kings Day, the day when people in many <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries traditionally exchange gifts. She said she presumed the money was from that stolen on Sept. 12, 1983, from the <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> in the second largest cash heist in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The government contends that <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> is a leader of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION>, a terrorist group seeking Puerto Rican independence. The group has claimed a role in attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON>' husband, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, who prosecutors say is a key defendant in the <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> robbery, and four other men are now on trial before <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON>.

 Border troops killed 14 Venezuelan fishermen at a weekend picnic, mistaking them for Colombian guerrillas, the government said Monday. Two fishermen escaped the Saturday morning attack by diving into the <LOCATION> Arauca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and swimming a half-mile to a ranch near the border town of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amparo </LOCATION>, sources there said. The Venezuelan-Colombian border incident, the bloodiest in years, took place at <LOCATION> Guafitas </LOCATION>, 360 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. Interior Minister <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Consalvi </PERSON> said the victims were `` peaceful Venezuelan fishermen,'' not members of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> as the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> originally stated `` President -LRB- <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> has ordered a wide, summary investigation into the incident,'' <PERSON> Consalvi </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Grimelda </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amparo </LOCATION> government official, said in a telephone interview the fishermen `` carried no weapons at all. At most some had just knives, as any ordinary fishermen do. `` They were going to have a chicken stew when soldiers started to fire. They were all honest people.'' She quoted the two survivors, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugueto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vollmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinilla </PERSON>, as saying the 14 bodies `` were bullet-riddled beyond recognition.'' Other sources in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amparo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, quoted the two as calling the shooting _ a land attack supported from the air _ a `` slaughter of defenseless, peaceful people who were sailing toward the beach on a weekend picnic.'' Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Camejo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who commands the special border security force, was quoted in press accounts immediately after the killing as saying the group had been armed with light submachine guns, explosives, and grenades, a list of possible kidnap targets, and a map of Venezuelan oil installations in the area. He was quoted as saying the victims were allegedly members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a leftist Colombian guerrilla group. <PERSON> Pinilla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> were transfered under police custody on Monday from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amparo </LOCATION> to police headquarters in neighboring <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristobal </LOCATION>, 400 miles west of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, and will give testimony in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristobal </LOCATION>, the sources reported. Consalvi blamed the shooting on a `` lamentable confusion'' on the part of the troops, who are responsible for guarding the river border against incursions into <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> by Colombian guerrillas. `` This is the only explanation we have for now,'' he said. Earlier Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said 16 Colombians were killed, but two bodies had yet to be found and 14 were still being identified. A ministry spokesman said Monday the men were part of a group of about 50 who were crossing the <LOCATION> Arauca </LOCATION> to enter <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> can pump up to 52,000 barrels per day of oil from the area, and last year completed an oil pipeline from <LOCATION> Guafitas </LOCATION> to a small refinery 90 miles north at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Silvestre </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> increased its border security in February in response to a rise in kidnappings of its citizens by alleged Colombian guerrillas.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mocked <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Monday for claiming the liberal label that the Democratic nominee had long avoided, and ridiculed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' invitation for a third televised debate on election eve next week. Instead, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> debate himself, `` the New Left vs. the Old Left.'' `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ... it should be an entertaining debate,'' the vice president said in rallies in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> who now calls himself a liberal could debate the earlier one who shunned the `` L word,'' which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have used repeatedly to taunt the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor Faced with an apparent narrowing of his lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in several major states, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appealed for the support of disenchanted Democrats. He borrowed a phrase made popular by former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in calling them `` the silent majority.'' As the presidential campaign entered its final week, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee wasted no time in poking fun at his Democratic rival for embracing liberalism Sunday during a campaign tour of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Sunday, and dismissed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' challenge to join him in an hour-long debate the night before the Nov. 8 election. `` An election eve debate? Read my hand gesture. That says it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters accompanying him on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two in a paraphrase of his `` read my lips: no new taxes'' line. The vice president held up one finger, then two, to indicate the two previous presidential debates in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in late September and mid-October. Speaking to a rally in the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked his audience to `` remember how -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- jumped all over me for using the L-word'' in their second debate. `` Well, yesterday, miracle of miracles. Headlines. Read all about it. He's using the liberal label again,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Suggesting that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> debate himself, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee said: `` One could claim to be on the side of ordinary Americans and the other could explain whether he thinks ordinary Americans oppose the death penalty for drug kingpins like he does, favor weekend furloughs for convicted murders ... oppose asking for a requirement for teachers to lead the kids in the Pledge of Allegiance.'' He repeated those lines at a subsequent rally in the remodeled Union Station in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, adding that `` at the end, the moderator should say, will the real governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> stand up.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> boarded a train for a five-minute ride into the cavernous, open-air station, where he addressed several thousand people from a platform he shared with an oversized pumpkin with `` Bush-Quayle 88'' carved in its side. `` We're in a horserace,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the crowd. `` I wo n't settle for anything less than a first-place finish.'' In <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he could now use the `` L word freely,'' and declared that `` we can not let the naive disarmers and the nuclear freezers back into the White House.'' In his appeal to what he called `` abandoned'' Democrats, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had moved away from mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` So, my pitch here, in the last eight days, is to those good Democrats, the rank and file,'' he said. `` I tell them: have hope, have confidence.'' <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, where local polls show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> enjoys a double-digit lead, has nine electoral votes. <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, where polls show the race to be much closer, has 11 electoral votes. At another pep rally in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said told the crowd, `` we are involved in a tough race,'' and repeated his pledge to campaign as if the Republican ticket were 10 points behind in the polls. `` I do n't care what these polls show,'' he said. The vice president planned to spend most of the week campaigning in large Midwestern industrial states before heading for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said the vice president planned to spend much of his remaining time in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' `` must-win'' states `` If you and your opponent are in his base states, then that's a sign you've met your goals and he has n't,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said in an interview. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would continue to campaign `` in our base states.'' Meanwhile, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign distributed a 348-page compilation of the vice president's campaign speeches bearing the title `` Leadership on the Issues,'' in an apparent effort to blunt criticism of negative <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign advertising attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stood by a stack of the books at the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> rally and said, `` This is what the campaign is about, not those TV ads.'' At least one of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speeches reprinted in the book had been sanitized. The vice president's highly publicized misstatement about Pearl Harbor Day occurring on Sept. 7 instead of Dec. 7 during a speech before the American Legion in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> does not appear in the book's version of the speech.

<TEXT>
 Democratic underdog <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a populist pitch for the support of women and young voters Monday, and said his boisterous reception `` smells like victory'' in the Nov. 8 election. He won cheers from an audience at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> for stands on abortion, the environment and economic opportunity, and drew loud, approving boos when he lambasted Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, on the same issues. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refrained from using the word `` liberal'' until a later appearance at <ORGANIZATION> Cerritos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where he cloaked himself in the `` liberal tradition of great presidents like <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> started using the word Sunday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, defiantly proclaiming himself a liberal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had repeatedly taunted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with the `` L word'' during the fall campaign, saying the Democrat has tried to hide his leftward leanings. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides also released a text of a five-minute commercial to be broadcast Tuesday night on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. In it <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refers to <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as well as <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` This election has always been an uphill fight,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says in the ad. `` But about some things, I'm as stubborn as my critics say, and I'm determined that in the intense days of this last week we will continue to see the truth and to speak it.'' He also criticizes the tone of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign, saying, `` They are running for the highest office in the land by waging the lowest-level campaign in modern history.'' At the San Jose appearance, he invoked the names of those three presidents as having provided `` a caring government and caring political leadership.'' Said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: `` That's the kind of president I want to be.'' `` It's Halloween today, is n't it?'' the Democratic nominee reminded his noisy campus audience in this environmentally sensitive state with its bigger-than-any prize of 47 electoral votes. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to be passing himself as an environmentalist. No treat for us. That's the biggest trick in the book,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He reaffirmed his opposition to oil drilling off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast and said the Reagan-Bush administration had `` the worst environmental record in the history of this country.'' He went on the counterattack against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticism of pollution in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. `` I'm not the guy who polluted <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I'm the guy who's cleaning it up, no thanks to Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his friends.'' Making his first major appeal to women voters, a traditional source of Democratic strength, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the Republican ticket had `` been on the wrong side of every issue of special importance to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women.'' He said that if voters believe in comparable wages for both sexes, affordable child care and parental leave laws, `` then we're on your side. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> then dropped his voice when he spoke of abortion. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shook his head when he said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had told a 12-year-old girl last week that if she were raped by her father and became pregnant, `` the government had a right to force her to bear that child.'' The overflow San Jose audience of several hundred people erupted in loud boos. -LRB- <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made no mention of the government when he answered an 11-year-old girl's question in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> last week about his advice in such a situation. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> responded that he favored childbirth over abortion even under those circumstances. -RRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his Republican opponent wanted to outlaw abortions. `` I believe a choice that personal must be made by the woman in the exercise of her beliefs,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He turned to his student listeners and quoted <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s words during a 1960 campaign visit to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` You have to decide which candidate reflects your judgment of our country, of its needs and of its future,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> boasted that he was narrowing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s once-formidable lead in the polls and said: `` There is a feeling in the air and it smells like victory to me.'' He challenged the vice president again to join him in an hour-long, nationally broadcast debate on election eve next Monday night. `` You ca n't inherit the White House,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` You've got to earn the right to be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed the invitation during a campaign appearance in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, mockingly suggesting that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> debate himself in a matchup of `` the New Left vs. the Old Left.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> headed for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a Midwestern industrial state where the Democratic nominee also hopes to overtake <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by election night.

 Judicial authorities on Monday forbid Greek-American banker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> from leaving <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> while he is under investigation following his indictment on charges of forgery and embezzlement. Several newspapers have claimed that members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION>, have financial links with <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> through his ownership of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>.

As students carrying Bush-Quayle signs worked their way to the front of the crowd, supporters of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded in kind, crowding closer and closer to the speakers until they were completely surrounded. <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> police attempted in vain to get the competing camps to pull back. About 200 people attended the rally, and the proximity of the crowd to the speakers made it difficult to hear the speeches from any distance. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters occasionally heckled but did not prevent members of `` Yalies Against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' or <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential candidate's son, from delivering their speeches. When speakers finished their remarks and `` Yalies Against Bush'' responded with `` Go Duke'' and other chants, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters, some of whom remained at the back of the crowd, yelled `` Four more years.''

 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have told the president of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> that a meeting with Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> would damage Turkish ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At the same time, a <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> official said his government asked <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> to stop in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> rather than in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, the capital, so as not to make his visit appear official. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> had asked to stop in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> and see President <PERSON> Kenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evren </PERSON> on his way home from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, said the official, who declined to be named. But Turkish authorities informed <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> that <PERSON> Evren </PERSON> would not be in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> that day and asked the Austrian to stop in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> instead. `` That way it does n't seem like an official visit,'' he said. In a telegram to President <PERSON> Evren </PERSON>, six members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> said they were `` appalled and shocked at the news that <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> will be received by you early in November.'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who has been shunned by Western governments because of accusations that he facilitated Nazi war crimes in World War II, is scheduled to stop in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> on Wednesday en route home from a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> visit. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and the American <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have expressed their view of <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> by banning him from even visiting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the telegram said. `` We wish to see Turkish-U.S. relations strengthened, and receiving <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> would have a very negative effect,'' the lawmakers said. The six representatives were: <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, D-N.Y. Their subcommittee, headed by Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., oversees the administration's policy toward <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and recommends to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the amount of aid the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ally Despite intense <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> efforts, aid for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> has been reduced steadily by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in recent years. The administration asked for $ 914.9 million for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in fiscal year 1988, but only got $ 525.3 million. Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., sent cables and letters to Turkish Ambassador <PERSON> Sukru </PERSON> <PERSON> Elekdag </PERSON> urging his government to reconsider its hosting of Meanwhile, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was greeted Monday in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> with a red carpet welcome and 21-gun salute at the start of his three-day state visit. He had just completed a four-day visit to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The topics for discussion in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> were expected to be the same as those in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>: the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process; the situation in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> stopped fighting; bilateral relations and key international issues, officials said.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' counterattacks have improved his rating as a crimefighter, but the Democratic presidential nominee still suffers from unsteady support within his own party, polls said Monday. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led by 11 points among likely voters in a national survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 52 percent 41 percent, and by seven points, 52 percent 45 percent, in a poll by <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and Associates. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> poll was done in the first half of last week; the <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll was more recent, conducted Friday through Sunday. Its 52-45 result was a very slight narrowing from 53-44 in a <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted Oct. 14-17. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> only recently began to counter <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charges that he was weak on crime, and the <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll indicated some results: Fifty-three percent rated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> soft on crime, still high but down from 63 percent in the earlier poll. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> also indicated that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had scored slightly by portraying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign advertisements as unfair. Seventy-five percent called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ads too negative, while 68 percent said the same of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' ads. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> poll, meanwhile, found support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> uneven within his own party, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> marshalled monolithic backing from Republicans and siphoned away some Democrats. Gallup said the presidential race has been largely stable for months, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead at least since September. But its poll found an underlying factor in his favor: His supporters were more loyal than they had been previously. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, has suffered slow erosion in his popularity, to a point now lower than other candidates in recent years, the poll said. And he lost support in some Democratic groups even while gaining it in others. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead was based upon overwhelming support from Republicans, solid backing from Republican-leaning independents and `` substantial defections'' from some Democratic groups, according to Gallup's analysis of the results. `` For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, on the other hand, his support is not as strong among his own partisans; and he is receiving virtually no defections from members of core Republican groups,'' the analysis said. The survey did find some room for change. Swing voters, those who were undecided or said they might change their minds, made up 27 percent of the likely voters. And only about half of each candidates' supporters backed them strongly. The problem in analyzing the race was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stable lead on one hand versus the softness of both candidates' support on the other. `` If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign can get their act together and speak to their constituencies or potential constituencies, they can win it on the basis of the numbers,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>, Gallup's president. `` But that's a big if, given the course of the campaign so far.'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> poll divides the electorate into 10 evenly sized groups whose members share general values. Its `` partisan poor,'' for example, is a Democratic group; its `` enterprisers'' and `` moralists'' are Republican. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attracted 21 percent of the `` partisan poor,'' in the new survey, significantly poaching in a Democratic stronghold. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, by contrast, drew only 2 percent of the `` enterprisers'' and 3 percent of the `` moralists.'' The last Times-Mirror poll, in September, identified `` disaffected'' voters, set apart by their suspicion of government, as a swing group. After a nearly even division in May, they backed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 61-27 percent last month. In the new survey that preference held steady, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s supporters in the group grew more loyal to him: Fifty-one percent said they were unlikely t switch to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, up from 36 percent last month `` In contrast, on the Democratic side, defections to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have doubled among ` seculars' and significantly increased among the ` partisan poor,''' Gallup said. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offset the losses with gains in other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> groups, it said, the movement was `` indicative of the problems that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has had in achieving enthusiastic support'' from some groups within his own party. Additionally, among all registered voters, not just those likely to vote, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was rated favorably by 48 percent, compared with 58 percent favorable for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The poll analysis said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' rating was `` significantly below'' those of most candidates in recent presidential elections <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> poll was conducted Oct. 23-26 among 2,006 registered voters, of whom 1,505 were considered likely to vote. The error margin for the likely voter group was plus or minus three points. The Harris poll was done among 1,250 likely voters and also had a three-point margin of error. In a state poll Monday, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> put the race in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at 51 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 44 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. That survey was done Saturday and Sunday among 510 likely voters; while the spread was within its margin of error of five points, other recent polls also have found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> slightly ahead there. In a separate poll in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 53 percent to 39 percent among 397 likely voters. The poll was taken last Monday through Thursday and had a margin of error of four points. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, a survey of 1,019 likely voters Sunday through Thursday found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading 45-40. The survey had a margin of error of three points.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>, the producer who terrified millions with the `` War of the Worlds'' and won an Oscar for intimidating his students as the imperious law professor in `` The Paper Chase,'' died Monday. He was 86. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> died at his seaside home before dawn, said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goff </PERSON>, a family friend and scriptwriter. <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>, a longtime friend and colleague, said he had spinal cancer. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> brought a magnetic eloquence to the role of the curmudgeon and gained wide fame while in his 70s as Professor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsfield </PERSON> in `` The Paper Chase,'' a role he first played in the 1973 film and then in the television series. He parlayed his fame and his distinctive speaking style into a lucrative series of commercial endorsements, including ads for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> in which he growled, `` They make money the old-fashioned way _ they EARRNNN it.'' <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>'s characters were marked by a stern, autocratic tone, yet those who knew him well described him as quiet and gentle. `` Behind that austere public posture was the warmest, most generous man in the world _ with his time, his remarkable intelligence, his insight,'' said writer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rintels </PERSON>, who collaborated with <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> on the movie `` Gideon's Trumpet'' and the play `` <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>.'' Said actor <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>: `` He was a gentleman of the old school, polite and courtly. He had wonderful manners. He was an unusual character and I'm going to miss him.'' While he was best known for his work on screen, <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>'s strongest affections were the theater, book writing and teaching His acting students included <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> appears in the new <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> movie, `` Another Woman,'' in which Stiers plays a younger <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>. `` He was somebody who has been responsible, probably, for more people's careers in American theater than any single person, and we're going to miss him very, very much,'' Ms. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> said. At the time of his death, <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> had achieved what he told friends was his ultimate dream: the establishment of The Acting Company, a touring theatrical ensemble of the nation's brightest talents. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> co-produced the `` War of the Worlds'' radio drama for <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>. He later apologized for the nationwide panic induced by the program about invading Martians which aired 50 years ago Sunday. Born <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the veteran actor, director and producer launched his career in 1934 as the director of a Broadway production of the <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein-Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> opera `` Four Saints in Three Acts.'' In 1937 he helped Welles form <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Mercury Theatre, and he co-wrote the original story for <PERSON> Welles </PERSON>' legendary film `` Citizen Kane'' in 1941. During a tribute in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to him in 1987, <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> said, `` The only important thing when you've lived as long as I have is what you've accomplished _ a body of work. ... We all tend to talk about our successes. At least as important are our failures.'' He had many successes to boast about. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> played small roles in the 1938 film `` Too Much Johnson'' and in the 1964 film `` Seven Days in May'' before emerging as a strong film actor in `` The Paper Chase.'' He won a best supporting actor for his portrayal of <LOCATION> Kingsfield </LOCATION>. His film acting credits include `` Rollerball,'' `` Three Days of the Condor,'' `` The Cheap Detective'' `` St. Ives,'' `` Old Boyfriends,'' `` The Fog,'' `` Ghost Story'' and `` Bright Lights, <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' He starred in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television series based on the movie `` The Paper Chase,'' and after its cancellation, he stayed with the series for several years on Showtime pay television. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> starred in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` The Winds of War'' as Dr. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON>, a Jewish scholar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the start of World War II, but the role was taken over by Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> for the sequel, `` War and Remembrance,'' which <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will telecast beginning Nov. 13. During World War II, <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> was head of the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. In the 1950s he produced a television classic, `` The Seven Lively Arts.'' He also produced a number of `` Playhouse 90'' shows. <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> also appeared in the miniseries `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: Behind Closed Doors'' and `` <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>.'' One of his last appearances was a year ago as co-anchorman on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> comedy special `` Our Planet Tonight.'' In September, <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> said he had no plans to slow down. `` I have tapered off a little, but I would n't know what to do with myself if I retired,'' he said three days before his 86th birthday. `` I still have something to offer, even though the roles these days are usually small. `` But I'm 85 years old. I am not going to be offered the role of <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> anymore, or Juliet, for that matter. Yet the limited range I do play, I play well. My range is that of an old man, but what do you expect from someone who started acting at the age of 70?'' <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, and sons <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON>. There will be no funeral, but a memorial service was being planned, said publicist <PERSON> Judi </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Monday extended a 7-month-old cease-fire with anti-Sandinista rebels until the end of November. The government newspaper <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> urged Nicaraguans to prepare for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion. A statement released by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s office said the president extended the truce `` with the objective of enabling Contra -LRB- rebel -RRB- groups to put down their arms, take advantage of the amnesty and enter the normal life of the country.'' The cease-fire would have expired Nov. 1. Monday's action was the sixth one-month extrension by the government. The U.S.-backed rebels have said they extended the cease-fire indefinitely. The formal truce went into effect April 1. Sandinistas and rebels agreed on March 21 to halt operations involving military offense. Two days later they signed a pact agreeing to try to negotiate a peaceful settlement of their 8-year-old war. Talks on a permanent settlement became stalemated in September. Each side has accused the other of frequent violations of the truce. Monday's statement said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s decision `` will not affect popular mobilization plans for the defense of the fatherland.'' <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said the possibility of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion was increasing. Under the headline `` Rising Threat,'' an editorial said Honduran troops on Sunday harassed a Nicaraguan border village and accused <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> of what it called a recent series of cross-border attacks. The government claims the attacks are part of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan to provoke a border war with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops then would invade to back <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. A Barricada caption under a map of a region of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> that juts into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> said about 40 Honduran military posts had been established in the area to protect 4,000 Nicaraguan rebels in camps in Honduran territory. Last week <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> claimed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> armed 3,000 rebels and ordered them back into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to take advantage of the destruction left by Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> that slashed across <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Oct. 22. `` Facing this new escalation of Yankee aggression the people will have to strengthen their forces and mobilize ... their combatants because we ca n't permit genocide,'' <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said.

 A man admitted Monday he took part in an arson fire that destroyed a church which had just been rebuilt from a similar blaze, authorities said. The Oct. 18 fire destroyed the 125-year-old <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fork </ORGANIZATION>. It was the second arson fire at the African Methodist Episcopal facility in six months. Madison County Sheriff <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchich </PERSON> declined to identify the man, who was charged with a single count of arson and was being held on $ 100,000 bond. Members of the church's black congregation have complained of racially motivated vandalism. Last year, racial epithets were carved into the walls, and swastikas were spray-painted on the church. Then, on April 16, the building was destroyed by fire. Undaunted, the congregation voted to rebuild the frame building on the same spot in <LOCATION> Godfrey </LOCATION>, a town of 1,000. The church stood at the end of a gravel road in a remote, wooded area near a mostly white neighborhood. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> was set to reopen Nov. 6 but was destroyed a second time. `` It hurts. I cry practically every day,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DeBruce </ORGANIZATION>, 63, whose great-grandparents escaped slavery and organized the church in 1863. `` I feel like I have lost somebody in my family.'' Investigators declined to say if the man in custody was implicated in the first fire.

 Two gambling clubs and a lone player will share a $ 61.98 million lottery jackpot that officials say is the world's largest, it was announced Monday. The windfall will be divided among a group of 25 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> employees in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, 15 hospital workers in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 45-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> production supervisor who lives in Westminster, said lottery spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Each of the groups and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> will receive one-third of the jackpot, or nearly $ 20.66 million, which will be paid over two decades in equal annual payments after taxes, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. The lottery deducts 20 percent of winnings for federal income taxes. Officials said the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> workers will get an estimated $ 33,000 annually after taxes for 20 years; the hospital workers, $ 55,000 each year for two decades after taxes; and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, $ 826,400 annually after taxes for 20 years. Most of the 15 workers from the hospital in <LOCATION> Fallbrook </LOCATION> arrived at a lottery district office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> riding in limousines to present their winning ticket. At <LOCATION> Fallbrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, respiratory therapist and winner <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> declared, `` I'm about the only working millionaire at this place today. Everybody else is off.'' The overall jackpot increased from an estimated $ 60.8 million to $ 61.98 million when annuities that will be used to make payments to winners were purchased Monday, said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. `` We're very common, real people,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>. `` We have our friends and this is our house. We're not going to move.'' The two now earn about $ 40,000 a year. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he plans to quit his job so he and his wife can travel. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he went to work Sunday and told co-workers of his good fortune. `` They thought I was kidding,'' he said. `` Then they decided I was serious.'' Appliance repairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopita </PERSON>, 42, of the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Shingle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, held the winning ticket for the group of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> workers, lottery officials said. The lottery first scheduled, then canceled a news conference with the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> winners. The employees said they wanted to avoid the publicity and had to return to work, said lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rendahl </PERSON>. A woman who identified herself only as <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> service center said she was one of 25 people in the pool there who won. `` I'm pretty excited about it. Would n't anybody be?'' she said. Surinder Sanghera, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Sangheras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liquors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> group bought its tickets, said of its members: `` They are regulars. I think they've been buying here since the lotto began.'' <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach-Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, a 36-year-old intensive care nurse, held the winning ticket for 15 <ORGANIZATION> Fallbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dragon </PERSON>, a technician at the hospital, said she joined 13 nurses, laboratory technicians and other employees _ as well as a friend of one of the workers _ in putting $ 40 each toward the tickets. All told, she said, the group bought $ 600 worth of tickets. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, another of the hospital winners, said he really had n't had much of a chance yet to celebrate `` Monday mornings are busy around this place anyway,'' he said. `` Betwixt and between seeing my patients, I've had many congratulations.'' Asked what he planned to do with the money, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, `` I'd like to pay my son's tuition -LRB- at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> -RRB- and maybe take a little vacation. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON>, manager at the Circle K store where the group bought tickets, said that half an hour after the drawing one member of the group walked in to pick up the computer printout of winning numbers. `` He got it, kissed it and started walking back out to his truck, but before he could leave he had to sit down on the curb to collect himself,'' <PERSON> McKeel </PERSON> said. The members of both winning groups will be responsible for making their own arrangements to divide the money. The lottery pays out to a single winner, the person holding the ticket. The jackpot was the world's largest lottery prize, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. The previous record was $ 56 million in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gordo </LOCATION> lottery in 1983. The previous North American record was a $ 55.16 million jackpot in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lotto last month, but that prize went to a single winner. The winning numbers that produced the windfalls for 41 players in Saturday night's `` Lotto 6 @ 49'' drawing were: 5, 20, 26, 28, 32, and 39. The jackpot soared because for the fourth consecutive time nobody picked the six winning numbers between 1 and 49 in Wednesday's $ 33.4 million drawing. The jackpot rolled over to the Saturday game and grew with each ticket sale.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A lawyer who specialized in land-dispute cases was stopped on a road and killed by two gunmen wearing army uniforms, radio <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday.

 A church leader gave Salvadoran rebels a report Monday on proposals for a negotiated solution to their 9-year-old war with U.S.-backed governments of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>, Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said the proposal was based on observations about the political, social, military and economic situation from more than 60 Salvadoran organizations. Rebel leader <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella organization for five Salvadoran guerrilla groups, considered the report positive because it demands `` an end to the war and the reasons that led to it.'' He and rebel representative <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> added, however, that reopening talks with the government would be difficult. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> presented the report on what he called a `` national debate'' during a ceremony at a military installation attended by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military commander and de facto ruler. <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and later said they briefed him on visits by rebel representatives to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to promote a negotiated settlement. They said rebel officials would return to those countries to inform the government leaders of their meeting with the archbishop. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said the report contained 140 ideas offered by the 60 organizations in several days of meetings with church leaders, but he gave no details. Salvadoran church leaders have mediated the few meetings between the government and rebels, and frequently urge that talks resume. The last meeting was Oct. 20, 1987 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the report `` can reactivate the peace process,'' but another round of talks with the government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> `` is n't easy now.'' `` Negotiations in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> are quite complicated,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` The Americans oppose them, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> opposes them, parts of the private sector oppose them so we have to build relations among forces to open negotiations.'' He said the rebels have set no preconditions for talks but rejected previous government demands that the rebels lay down their weapons. `` We have given them the message that we are ready to talk with all social forces, including the army, that we are ready to talk at any place or time,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` The one that's established conditions is the government,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has said that in order to talk again with the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- rebels' front -RRB- we have to put down our arms. This is absurd, it's inadmissible. Venceremos, the clandestine rebel radio, said Monday that Salvadoran rebels had killed the mayor of a small town in <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION>, a western province in the war zone. The army said 53 rebels and 29 soldiers were killed in several skirmishes in October.

<HEAD>Ban on Wild Horse `Adoption' Upheld</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal `` adopt-a-horse'' program that is supposed to protect wild horses and burros is actually sending some of them to slaughter, a federal appeals court said Monday in upholding restrictions on the program. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> `` renders the adoption process a farce'' by failing to screen out owners whose intention is killing the horses for use as pet food, said the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The 3-0 decision prohibits the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> from transferring title of any wild horse or burro to a person who is known to intend commercial exploitation _ slaughter or use in a rodeo. The court did not say what steps the government agency must take to learn the intent of a would-be owner. But the ruling was hailed by animal-rights organizations who filed the lawsuit. `` We were determined from the start that the blood money of these ` national treasures,' as the Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act defined these animals, should not end in the hands of already amply paid profiteers,'' said writer <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> <PERSON> Amory </PERSON>, founder and president of the Fund for Animals, one group involved in the lawsuit. He said it was also important that the court had recognized the right of animal-rights organizations to challenge the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION>'s management of animals <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Amory </PERSON>'s group, said the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> reportedly has suspended its adoption program and replaced it with other protective measures, such as a sanctuary for wild horses. But he said the ruling could determine the fate of many of the estimated 8,000 wild horses that have been adopted in the last year. Under a BLM policy challenged in the lawsuit, the agency does not not inquire as to the intentions of an adopter who has taken humane care of a horse for a year. The heaviest population of the horses is in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> James </PERSON> said they can be found over a wide area west of the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. A 1971 federal law, which described the wild horses as `` living symnbols of the historic and pioneer spirit,'' ordered protective measures for the animals on public lands. Later laws set up the adoption program, in which people could pay the government $ 125 per horse and $ 75 per burro for the right to tame up to four animals for riding or make other uses of them. The <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> is allowed to transfer ownership of an animal to an adopter who has assured humane treatment and has taken good care of the animal for a year. Animal rights groups filed suit in 1985 after the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> said it would waive fees for animals that were considered `` unadoptable.'' In response to the lawsuit, the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> conceded that it had allowed adoption of horses by some people who intended slaughter or other commercial exploitation. But the government agency argued that it was within its authority, since another federal law allowed the humane destruction of wild horses that can not be adopted. That authority has never been used, however, and was suspended by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year, the court said. In upholding a ruling by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> McKibben </PERSON>, the appeals court rejected the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION>'s argument that it can transfer title to anyone who has taken proper care of a wild horse for a year, regardless of future intentions. The agency's `` disregard for the announced future intentions of adopters undercuts <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' desire to ensure humane treatment for wild horses and burros,'' said the opinion by Judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Choy </PERSON>. `` In fact, it renders the adoption process a farce, for the one-year requirement of humane treatment and care serves no purpose if on the day the one-year period expires, the adopter can proceed to the slaughterhouse.'' The court did not say whether the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> had the authority to waive adoption fees.

 American hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, in a videotape released Monday by his kidnappers, read a statement that accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of blocking his release and urged the next president to do more. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> denied interfering with efforts to free <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, and his chief spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, denounced the tape as `` a cynical attempt'' to influence the Nov. 8 election. Copies of the 2-minute, 35-second tape were delivered to two Western news agencies in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> four days after <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, marked his fourth birthday in captivity. Statements from the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, which holds <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, accompanied the tapes. `` On the occasion of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s birthday and in response to your letters, and according to his desire to send you a recorded message, we hereby enclose with this statement the recorded message on videotape,'' the kidnappers said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, began the message by identifying himself and saying the date was Oct. 30. `` Once again I'm being given a chance to speak to my family, to my friends and to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' he said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said his spirits were boosted by the birthday greetings he received, `` But as my fourth birthday in captivity passes and as the end of my fourth year -LRB- in captivity -RRB- approaches, I find it difficult to keep my hopes and my courage high.'' `` I've been very close to being released several times over the past two years. But each time it seems that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government uses its influence to stop any agreement from being made. And I do n't understand this.'' In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters his administration had done everything possible to win the hostages' freedom. `` I do n't think that was <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> speaking,'' he said `` I think he had a script that was given to him.'' When asked about the statement on the tape that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government interfered when the hostages were about to be released, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` That is absolutely not true, but let me point something out. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in that terrible confinement at the hands of those barbarians _ any information he has has to have come from there; there is no contact with the outside world.'' `` We have been doing everything we can for the release of the hostages, and the very simple answer is, for those people, to let them go,'' the president said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, `` I gather there's been very little discussion about this problem in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential campaign and that's disappointing, as is President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s complete failure to find a solution during his eight years in office `` But whichever candidate wins this election, remember an unyielding refusal to deal with this matter is not going to make it go away. It is not going to free us.'' He urged the next president to use his influence `` in a positive way, not a negative one,'' to end his plight. Of the two candidates, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> singled out Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I'm not asking President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to deal with terrorists, although both he and Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did so in the Iran-Contra affair and the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijack,'' the message said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not been named previously as a negotiator in the 1985 jet hijacking, in which Shiite Moslems demanding freedom for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> prisoners held 39 Americans for 17 days and killed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver. The vice president has minimized his role in the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The deal became known as the Iran-Contra affair when it was revealed that money for the arms was funneled to Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the comments about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were `` totally incorrect, wrong.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> appeared from the waist up. He was dressed in a gray track suit and read the statement in a steady voice. He was shaven, his hair was combed, and he wore glasses. He said he was being treated well. It was the third videotaped message from <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> released by the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, which kidnapped <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> on March 16, 1985. He is the longest-held of the 14 foreign hostages. Nine are Americans. The previous two messages were released Oct. 3, 1986 and Dec. 24, 1987. In addition to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Islamic </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> holds <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Colo </PERSON>. He was acting dean of agriculture at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> when he was kidnapped June 19, 1985. Islamic Jihad has freed three American hostages in the last three years _ the Rev <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON>, a Presbyterian minister; the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest; and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>'s release on Nov. 2, 1986, was linked to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Our problem could have been solved long ago without such complications as arms deals,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said in his message. `` I heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious efforts to free three trapped whales a few days ago and the president's thanks to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for its help. It is a warming story,'' he said. `` That kind of cooperation and spirit is absolutely necessary to bring this situation to an end.'' The tape ended with a message to his family: `` Peg, <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON>, Dad, kiss my daughters for me.

Mrs. Say, in <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> on Monday, said she continues hoping for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s release, but has given up criticizing federal policy against conceding to her brother's kidnappers. `` You come to a place where you understand that when a horse dies you get off it,'' she said. `` The hostages are not a great enough number to excite the masses.'' But `` if there were a plane load of Americans,'' she asked, `` would we allow our president to not lift a finger?''

 The intense, two-week takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was rather like the storm before the calm, as analysts said Monday they expect <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. to make few changes in the company it is buying for $ 13.1 billion `` I suspect we'll have <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> left alone for a year,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, who tracks both companies for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Diana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed, saying, `` It appears that both companies will be run separately. <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> based his prediction on <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>' history. `` When they bought <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, they left it alone for two years,'' he said, referring to the 1985 purchase of another major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food manufacturer. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> executives did not seek changes in General Foods until the division began having problems, <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> noted, adding that he did not anticipate similar steps to be taken at <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> manages their business better than <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> does,'' he said. In fact, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> might draw on <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s expertise to help <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>' sales and earnings growth, which have flagged in recent years. `` There are more problems at General Foods that <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> could fix,'' <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> announced Sunday that they had signed an agreement under which <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> would boost its tender offer for all of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s outstanding stock to $ 106 a share from $ 90. The <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> board said it was recommending shareholders accept the deal. It appeared Monday <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> investors would enthusiastically endorse the acquisition. The company's stock soared $ 7 a share to $ 103.50 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> rose 62 -LCB- cents a share to $ 95.37 -LCB-. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> had bitterly opposed as inadequate the initial $ 90-a-share offer <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> made Oct. 17. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> then unveiled a defensive restructuring that would pay stockholders a package of cash and securities that <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> valued at $ 110 a share. After negotiations Friday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, company officials worked out a preliminary agreement that the <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> board approved at a meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Hamish </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said. The acquisition _ the largest combination of non-oil companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ would fulfill <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>' goal of reducing its dependence on revenue from its slowing cigarette business. It also would become a tougher competitor against other giant multinational corporations like <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, the giant Anglo-Dutch concern that <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> will displace as the world's biggest consumer products company `` It will boost <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>' sales from about $ 30 billion in 1988 to $ 45.5 billion in 1989,'' Ms. <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> predicted, adding that the combination `` will boost non-tobacco operations to up to 35 percent of sales.'' The acquisition would add well-known <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> labels such as Velveeta processed cheese, Parkay margarine, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> cream cheese, Miracle Whip salad dressing and Sealtest ice cream to popular <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> brands like <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> beer, Marlboro cigarettes, Jell-O and <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> coffee. The combination also would create the world's second biggest food products operation after <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said Monday he has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to launch an antitrust investigation of the deal. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the resulting company would be so large it could seriously affect competition and raise the prices of prepared foods. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business rights. <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said the agency would not comment on whether it was looking into the merger. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said there were no plans to sell any major <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> assets. While the analysts expected <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> to exist as separate entities for the near-future, they said they did not expect the honeymoon to last forever. `` It would make sense if they were combined,'' because the new company could save on manufacturing, distribution and administrative costs, <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday rejected as `` absolutely not true'' charges that he and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made deals with terrorists and deliberately thwarted the release of hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Responding to allegations read by American hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in a new videotape released by his pro-Iranian captors in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` I do n't think that was <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> speaking. I think he had a script that was given to him.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked about the tape at a ceremony where he signed legislation that offers <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> artists and writers copyright protections under an international treaty. On the two-minute, 35-second tape, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, voiced a statement accusing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government of preventing his release. The statement also accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of having dealt with terrorists in the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner and in the Iran-Contra arms deal, another allegation <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> denied. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nightly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I had no role that you are aware of or not aware of, absolutely,'' in the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking negotiations. The Republican presidential candidate also said he was `` a little bit optimistic about their letting these hostages out. I think with Iran-Iraq having a cease-fire, I think it's in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s interest, though they do n't hold the hostages, to do what they can to encourage their release I think it would set whoever is elected president a good tone for the possibility of improved relations.'' Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had denounced the kidnappers, accusing them of `` a cynical attempt'' to use the hostages to influence the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election. Contrary to many instances in the past, the president spoke at length with reporters about the latest hostage tape. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appeared eager to discuss the matter, and stepped up to the microphone to answer reporters' questions. Queried whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had interfered when the hostages were about to be released, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` That is absolutely not true, but let me point something out. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> _ in that terrible confinement at the hands of those barbarians _ any information he has, has to have come from there; there is no contact with the outside world.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> insisted that his administration has been `` doing everything we can for the release of the hostages, and the very simple answer is, for those people, to let them go.'' `` There has never been any interference, nor have we ever been negotiating any more than we would with any other kind of a kidnapper on a ransom type of basis,'' he said. When asked whether he thought the kidnappers were trying to influence the outcome of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election, he said, `` You'd have to ask them; I ca n't fathom their minds.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> then went on to dispute the charge on the tape that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was involved in negotiations in the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and in resolving the 1985 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jet. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed by the hijackers during that ordeal. `` Nor was I, because we were never doing anything of that kind,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied. Asked again if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had played a role in negotiations for the release of the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hostages, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> launched into a spirited defense of his vice president, saying `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> has been a part of everything we've accomplished. I've always felt that a vice president should be an executive vice president, as in a corporation, and not somebody sitting over on the sidelines waiting for me to have a relapse.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went on: `` He's been a part of that, but in a constructive way, and that's why he's my choice in this coming election.'' But when pressed again whether he was answering ` yes,' to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s alleged involvement in the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> turned to answer another query about the circumstances of the release of the tape <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> he was never involved in negotiations either in the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> or the Iran-Contra cases, according to press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. The vice president previously has said he was not a key player in the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and was unaware of details and planning of it. Pressed to explain his and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s involvement in the Iran-Contra affair _ which the questioner described as having developed into a scandal _ the president shot back, `` There was no scandal. That scandal, I'm afraid, has been artificially created by a media that I can not understand.'' About prospects for release of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and other Americans held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the president said, `` I'm not going to give up hope for any of our hostages that are held; that's just too unthinkable.'' But, he said, `` the one thing we can not do is negotiate with the kidnappers on a sort of ransom idea because that just encourages more kidnaping and more hostage-taking.'' Asked what about <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s statement that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appeared to show more interest in the release of the two gray whales trapped in the ice of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> than the fate of the hostages, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded again that he believed <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was only reading a script that had been given him. `` When I was given a script, I always read the lines,'' he added. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, said Monday her brother looked stronger than in the past, adding, `` He seemed somewhat relaxed. I did n't see the kind of tension or fear that has come across in some of the pictures -LRB- released in the past -RRB-.'' She said she has given up criticizing federal policy against negotiating with her brother's kidnappers. `` You come to a place where you understand that when a horse dies you get off it,'' Say said. `` The hostages are not a great enough number to excite the masses. -LRB- But -RRB- if there were a plane load of Americans, would we allow our president to not lift a finger?''

<TEXT>
 American soprano <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Malfitano </PERSON> was cheered after a great performance in the title role of `` Madama Butterfly'' on Monday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Covent Garden. The house had been sold out for weeks for the new production of <PERSON> Giacomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON>'s opera by Spanish actress and theater director <PERSON> Nuria </PERSON> <PERSON> Espert </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Espert </PERSON> shared the acclaim when she joined the cast and production team in taking 11 curtain calls. Few women producers are in the opera business. Ms. <PERSON> Espert </PERSON>, who has her own theater company in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, has done only one other opera. But she is quickly adding a reputation for the difficult art to her fame as an actress and stage director. Asked later in a dressing-room interview if she found any difference between direction by a woman and a man, Ms. <PERSON> Malfitano </PERSON> replied, `` There is n't any. But <PERSON> Nuria </PERSON> is full of wonderful ideas and I was able to ask her questions about the role which I would have been hesitant to put to a man.'' The New York-born singer added, `` If there is a difference, it's a sense that she feels things I might feel about the character because she is a woman But that's not to say that men are n't intuitive and sensitive. Ms. <PERSON> Malfitano </PERSON> gave a heart-tugging interpretation of Cio-Cio-San, the Japanese geisha girl known as Butterfly who falls in love with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkerton </PERSON>. In what looks like a very un-Japanese reaction, the singer writhes on the floor of her tenement apartment when she learns that <PERSON> Pinkerton </PERSON> has deserted her and intends to take their son away. `` Nuria had me do that _ we both have great love for Cio-Cio-San,'' Ms. <PERSON> Malfitano </PERSON> explained. `` We did n't do it from a Japanese viewpoint. This is an opera by a European and it's a European view of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But I think reaction to pain and grief is universal. `` When we are alone we do things the world would not expect to see. It's a private moment that's very painful, an extreme moment we express in an extreme way. It should be shocking and almost surprising and it has the ring of truth,'' the singer said. Ms. <PERSON> Malfitano </PERSON>'s dark-eyed beauty was enhanced by her long hair, worn down to her waist in the role. `` Yes, it is my own _ people are always asking me,'' she said, laughing. Her father's parents emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Linguaglossa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Fiumefreddo </PERSON> di Sicilia in the foothills of the Mt. Etna volcano. Welsh tenor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, who sang <ORGANIZATION> Pinkerton </ORGANIZATION>, also said he found no difference in being directed by a woman. Chewing on a piece of butterscotch _ `` It moistens the mouth and I just happened to have it in my pocket'' _ he said: `` <PERSON> Nuria </PERSON> knows the piece and it's just a matter of interpretation. It's what she wanted and I hope we've made sense of it.'' The opera was first staged as a contemporary story in 1904. Ms. <PERSON> Espert </PERSON> places it in 1937 to heighten the tension between Americans and Japanese, four years before the attack at <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. But she does not transform the story in any way. She said before the first night she does n't believe in `` director's opera.'' `` It is just a fashion. In opera, the true director is the composer and everything is in the music. You need a very good ear and to listen carefully,'' Ms. <PERSON> Espert </PERSON> told <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>. The cleverly designed tenement, set on three floors, was by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ezio </PERSON> <PERSON> Frigerio </PERSON>. His wife, <PERSON> Franca </PERSON> <PERSON> Squarciapino </PERSON>, did the costumes. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schonwandt </PERSON> seemed to draw everything possible from his conducting of the opera house orchestra. Mezzo-soprano <PERSON> Miao </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON>, who sang the role of Cio-Cio-San's servant, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, in her British debut, is the first Chinese artist to sing with the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> and she looked delighted, waving her bouquet at the audience Ms. <PERSON> Malfitano </PERSON> was given three bouquets and happily carried the largest of them away with her, walking down Floral Street with her husband <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> and friends, looking at the posters of the production.

 About 60,000 government workers ended a five-day strike on Monday after receiving assurances that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would consider their demands. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> said the return to work may have prevented a coup. `` We passed the test and now it's a question of erasing the slate and starting over,'' <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> told a news conference. `` If there is no understanding and no dialogue, such abnormalities -LRB- as the strike -RRB- end in a violent confrontation or a coup.'' The workers, members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, struck last Wednesday and the armed forces occupied public buildings until the strike ended Monday morning. The strikers demanded paid vacations, improved job security, civil service reforms and varying pay increases. Their salary now averages $ 500 a month. No settlement was reached. <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> said he promised no retaliation would be made against strikers or strike leaders.

 A federal judge on Monday blocked a state law that would have banned the three major television networks from conducting exit polls just outside voting places to predict winners on election night. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doty </PERSON>, saying the law is likely to be found unconstitutional, issued a preliminary injunction against its enforcement. The 1984 law prohibits voters from being asked how they voted within 100 feet of the polling place. Nearly half the states have some limits on exit polling, in part because of fears that voter turnout will be hampered by early predictions of results. The networks targeted <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> along with six other states where they successfully challenged restrictions they considered so stringent they would effectively ban exit polls. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer representing <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, had argued that the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law violates free speech and would prevent family members from asking each other how they voted if they were within the zoned area. `` We're delighted,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Doty </PERSON>'s ruling. `` It's a First Amendment right that the public have that information. `` If the voter does n't want to answer questions he does n't have to, but if th voter is willing to answer the questions, he should be able to be a part of the process.'' <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> said that one of the principal concerns of the First Amendment is the free discussion of governmental affairs. He also said the First Amendment protects the news media's right to gather information. `` Thus, exit polling, which involves gathering and disseminating information on governmental affairs, is protected by the free speech clause of the First Amendment,'' <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerberg </PERSON>, a special assistant state attorney general, had argued that the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law was passed to preserve the sanctity of the polling place, to prevent harassment of voters, to prevent congestion and confusion around the polling place, and to encourage voter participation. <PERSON> Ackerberg </PERSON> said he would not comment on <PERSON> Doty </PERSON>'s ruling until he sees it Tuesday. <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> said legislators who wrote the law were primarily concerned with `` alleviating the threat that people might be discouraged from voting if a projection indicates that a particular outcome of an election is almost a certainty.'' `` Such a purpose is not a sufficient basis for restricting otherwise constitutionally protected speech,'' <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the networks have successfully fought similar exit polling restrictions in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Exit polling became controversial in 1980 when it became clear after polls closed in the East that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would defeat President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> by a landslide. Many Westerners were still voting when the networks declared <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the winner. The three networks say this year they will project winners of the presidential race state-by-state as polls close, but will refrain from declaring a winner overall until after voters on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> cast their ballots. State Rep. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a proponent of the law, said the Legislature is not likely to repeal the exit poll law unless courts declare it unconstitutional. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said exit polls `` might greatly reduce the voting of people in a democracy.'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the networks may try to obtain a permanent injunction against the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law after the election. But he said the next legal step by the networks will hinge on whether <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> officials `` persist in opposing our efforts'' to conduct exit polls.

 The busy presidential campaign helped persuade the government Monday to settle a false arrest lawsuit accusing <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents of beating a bystander during a 1984 raid on counterfeiters, attorneys said. The government, which needs the services during the campaign season of agents who might have had to testify, agreed to pay <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Scala </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> $ 2,500, but admitted no wrongdoing for the Sept. 8, 1984, incident. <PERSON> Scala </PERSON> had sued for $ 1 million in damages. `` They're busy,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said of the agents who would have had to testify and prepare for a trial. `` This is big crunch time,'' he said, referring to the comings and goings of the candidates. The Secret Service, a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, has the duty of protecting political figures and investigating counterfeiting. Scala charged that when agents burst into his <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> building to raid a counterfeiting ring, they handcuffed him, beat him and dragged him through the hallway and caused him `` severe and permanent injuries,'' said his lawsuit, which was filed 18 months later. The agents struck <PERSON> Scala </PERSON> in the head, neck and groin, according to the complaint. They also entered his apartment without a proper search warrant, it said. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in November 1985 denied an administrative settlement, so he went to federal court for damages and legal costs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Scala </PERSON> was never struck and was only detained after running away from the agents. He was handcuffed for 30 seconds and held for under five minutes until agents were told that <PERSON> Scala </PERSON> was a resident of the building, the attorney said. An agent chased <PERSON> Scala </PERSON> into his apartment on the basis of a broad search warrant, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> added. During the raid, <PERSON> Scala </PERSON> `` was kind of rubbernecking, you might say,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the afternoon raid netted $ 7.5 million in counterfeit currency, the largest such seizure at the time in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The bogus bills were mostly in denominations of $ 10 and $ 20. Five people were arrested and convicted or pleaded guilty, he said. <PERSON> Scala </PERSON>, in his 50s, could not be reached for comment. His home telphone number is not published. His attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, declined to comment on the settlement. He said his client was unemployed. The suit did not specify the nature of <PERSON> Scala </PERSON>'s injuries.

 Oscar campaigns begin earlier every year, and already the guns of autumn are firing for such potential nominees as <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON>. The studios and publicity offices are readying trade paper ads to offer films and performances `` for your consideration.'' The ads will feature reviewers' comments that a certain actor's work is deserving of Academy Award recognition. The champ in that department is <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>. The affable <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> has been the subject of the biggest publicity blitz since last year's blast for <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, who ended up with the best-actress Oscar for `` Moonstruck.'' First with `` Big'' and then with `` Punchline,'' <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> has been the recipient of glowing reviews, many of which mentioned his Oscar chances. A Hanks nomination seems certain, but for which movie? If Academy voters judge by financial success, they might choose his role in `` Big'' as the youngster who is transformed overnight into a 30-year-old. But they might consider his troubled comic in `` Punchline'' more of a challenge. Some observers believe <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> is overdue for an Oscar, and she is likely to be nominated for her role as the obsessed naturalist <PERSON> Dian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fossey </PERSON> in `` Gorillas in the Mist.'' If the Academy had an award for bravery, she would certainly win it for working intimately with the wild gorillas. Two recent performances have drawn Academy predictions from many reviewers: <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>'s rape victim in `` The Accused''; <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON>'s innocent among the Mafia in `` Things Change.'' Unlike 1987, when most of the Academy hopefuls were clumped in the final weeks, this time an impressive array of films and performances has been spread out over the year. Although more potential nominees will appear in November and December, it's possible to offer a survey of possibilities thus far As with last year, the strongest race appears to be among the female stars. Aside from <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, other performances which have attracted strong support include: <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>, `` Madame Sousatzka''; <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON>, `` A World Apart''; <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>, `` A Cry in the Dark''; <PERSON> Whoopi </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, `` Clara's Heart''; <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON>, `` Punchline''; <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowlands </PERSON>, `` Another Woman.'' Joining <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON> as possibilities for best actor: <PERSON> Forest </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, `` Bird''; <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Neill </PERSON>, `` A Cry in the Dark''; <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON>, `` Pascali's Island''; <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>, `` The Last Temptation of Christ''; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, `` Stand and Deliver''; <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>, `` Bull Durham.'' However, so far no runaway has been sighted for best picture of 1988. Here are some possibles: `` Big''; `` Gorillas in the Mist''; `` Punchline''; `` A Cry in the Dark''; `` Bull Durham''; `` Madame Sousatzka.'' The Oscar race will undoubtedly change as new entries reach the marketplace. The most promising works include: _ `` Rainman,'' with <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON>. _ `` Torch Song Trilogy,'' starring <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON> in the film version of his hit play, with <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bancroft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>. _ `` Mississippi Burning,'' starring <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>. _ `` Talk Radio,'' with <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>. _ `` The Accidental Tourist,'' co-starring <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. _ `` Beaches,'' with <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON>. _ `` Working Girl,'' starring <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>. The 61st Annual Academy Awards will arrive early next year _ March 29.

<TEXT>
 Parishioners found moistened sponges in the holy water fonts recently at the <LOCATION> Modena </LOCATION>'s 12th century Roman Catholic cathedral. Archbishop <PERSON> Santo </PERSON> <PERSON> Quadri </PERSON> apologized, explaining that the fonts had to be drained to stop drug addicts from using them to rinse their needles. Drug addiction, said the archbishop, `` is one of the heaviest crosses <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is carrying today.'' In the first nine months of this year, 500 deaths in the country have been attributed to heroin overdoses _ more than all of 1987. Former Premier <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON> said Mafia-controlled drug smuggling and killings will soon reach `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> proportions'' in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and called for life sentences for pushers. Police seizures of heroin have risen from 11,440 ounces in 1987 to more than 14,080 ounces so far this year. The use of cocaine, once reserved for the wealthy, is booming, with police seizing more than 17,600 ounces this year, compared to 14,472 ounces in all of last year. Drug pushers and users have been growing younger every year. A common urban sight has been police and sniffer dogs inspecting students' bags at the gates of high schools. On the first day of school in September, 113 drug peddlers were picked up across the country while lurking outside school buildings. The drug explosion has also stoked the spread of AIDS, which can be transmitted through dirty needles, turning <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> into the second worst affected country in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> behind <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, most of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s 2,233 AIDS victims have been heroin addicts The spread of drugs has been most spectacular in the rich north, home of high-tech companies, sleek factories and many of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s estimated 300,000 heroin addicts The communist municipal government in <LOCATION> Modena </LOCATION>, where Ferrari racing cars are made, has started subsidizing rehabilitation clinics and methadone substitution programs. Opera star <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>, a city native, has performed free for anti-drug benefits. In the neighboring <LOCATION> Lombardy </LOCATION> region, which accounts for nearly one quarter of the heroin deaths, the city of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> has put drugs just behind motor vehicle traffic as a top municipal priority. City workers have been detached to scoop up 3,000 to 4,000 discarded syringes daily from streets and parks. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, a similar municipal service has collected close to half a million in the past year. Because of the Sicilian Mafia and the Camorra crime organization in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is considered one of the main international shipping points for heroin to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. For years, the gangs largely refrained from selling on their home turf out of a sense of honor. But more and more drugs are being distributed at home because of a glut in other markets, according to the Italian <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s current drug law was passed in the wake of the more lenient atmosphere of the 1970s. It penalizes peddling while allowing possession of `` modest quantities.'' Sociologist <PERSON> Saverio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vertone </PERSON> charges that the law has turned every buyer into a potential pusher. `` Parliament followed the prevailing winds at the time,'' said <PERSON> Vertone </PERSON>. `` Even LSD was considered OK for personal consumption.'' <PERSON> Vertone </PERSON> has joined the chorus of Italians who are demanding tougher measures in the drug war. Pushers now face a maximum term of 30 years. The Rev. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Picchi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest who runs a string of rehabilitation centers, believes users should not be placed in the same category as pushers. `` Drug addicts need assistance,'' he said. `` You ca n't punish an alcoholic just because he's had a drink. The dealers of death, on the other hand, must face tougher sentences.'' One of <PERSON> Picchi </PERSON>'s proposals would provide for fines for recreational drug users.

<HEAD>Sweden Toughens Requirements for Soviet Asylum Seekers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> has toughened its requirements for granting asylum to Soviet defectors, acting on the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s word that the human rights climate is improving So far as is known, the Swedes are the first in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to modify their refugee policy to adjust for glasnost, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness. The Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has issued deportation orders against 10 Soviets asking to stay. The board held that they did not qualify as political refugees and that the risk has diminished they will be punished if they return home. Until last spring, asylum requests were routinely granted, on the assumption that anyone who was sent back could be prosecuted for anti-Soviet behavior. But now `` the legal environment has changed'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Westin </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> official, and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> now will judge each case on its merits. All 10 of the Soviets ordered deported have appealed and are still in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. While the 10 were turned down the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> approved about 80 other applications, officials said. <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> said those who were refused `` are not refugees. We do n't turn away refugees. He added that the board, after checking each case with the Swedish embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, was convinced that none would face reprisals. `` If that had been the case, we would n't turn them back.'' <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, which has one of the most liberal refugee policies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, gets more requests for asylum from Soviets than any other country on the continent. Defectors often leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with legal visas, then refuse to go back when their visas expire. Others reach the West after dramatic escapes. Last year a farm hand flew a crop duster airplane across the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and crashed near <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s Gotland island. Among 18,000 or so people granted asylum in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> last year, 73 came from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, while other countries in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> accepted fewer than 10 Soviets each. The number of Soviets asking to stay in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> was expected to reach 120 by the end of this year, partly because Soviet authorities were allowing more people to travel abroad and were less careful to make sure they intended to come back, officials said. Officials questioned in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> said the rules for Soviet citizens are no different from for any other country and have not changed in view of glasnost. `` Of course overall developments in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> play a role, but we would n't go so far as to say that due to glasnost and perestroika -LRB- restructuring -RRB- the problem has been solved,'' said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoeni </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s refugee commissioner in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, which is the only non-communist country to share a long land border with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and has a `` friendship pact'' with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, has handled the question of Soviet defectors delicately and usually in secret. Many reportedly have been turned away or quietly told to take the next ferry to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s decision to scrutinize <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> asylum seekers more carefully has caused consternation among Soviet emigres, who say they have less faith than the Swedish government in Soviet pledges of human rights reforms. <PERSON> Ulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignatz </PERSON>, editor of an Estonian-language newspaper published in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, said that those who return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may not be imprisoned as before but may find their careers blocked or face other forms of harassment. `` The legislation has not been changed,'' <PERSON> Juris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaza </PERSON>, a Stockholm-based freelance journalist specializing in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said of the Soviet pledges on human rights. `` The statute against anti-Soviet activity is still on the books. It's an arbitrary decision not to prosecute,'' he said. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s move also caught human rights groups by surprise. `` It's quite a new problem for us,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolling </PERSON>, of the Swedish branch of the London-based <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` We ca n't say that from our point of view asylum seekers face less of a risk today. We have no such information.''

 A clandestine group calling itself the Sons of <LOCATION> Glendower </LOCATION> has stepped up a 9-year-old arson campaign against English-owned property in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, increasing fears that the attacks will begin to claim lives. The group chooses violence to fight what many Welsh oppose _ the increased immigration of the English into <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Celtic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> has been united with <LOCATION> Saxon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> for 452 years, but nationalism remains a strong undercurrent in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, and the English influx is widely blamed for diluting the Welsh language and culture and inflating house prices beyond reach of the local people. Such themes are not confined to <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. Regional nationalism is a flourishing, often divisive force in this <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, not to mention subdivisions like <LOCATION> Cornwall </LOCATION> and the Isle of Man, where outsiders' vacation homes are also a target of local nationalists But in this western, coastal region of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the Welsh extremists have struck more frequently in recent months and have pushed across the border to burn down property in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The arsonists, who have their supporters but are shunned by the nationalist mainstream, also have expanded their targets from mostly vacation homes to commercial property like real estate offices, and they have begun using more sophisticated incendiary time-bombs. Nobody expects the attacks to escalate into a conflict like <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s, which has killed about 2,700 people in the past 20 years. But the time-bombs, which could go off at the wrong time or in the wrong hands, are causing serious concern. `` We have been so concerned about this change in tactics,'' said Inspector <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes-Jones </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Colwyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> headquarters of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> police. `` It is a miracle that nobody has been seriously injured or killed. With the recent escalation, the odds of that happening are shortening all the time.'' Recent weeks have seen at least 11 attacks on real estate offices, shops and a vacation home. Eight of those came on one weekend in early October over a widespread area of western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Fears also are growing that the campaign might encourage old prejudices and discourage job-creating inward investment _ problems <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> knows well. `` Obviously, anything of that sort would not exactly advertise the place,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wales </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Cardiff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has the potential of developing into a major problem.'' Since 1979, 19 men have been convicted of arson and damage offenses, police say, but the force has made no arrests in three years, and it is being criticized for failing to unmask the Sons of <LOCATION> Glendower </LOCATION>. Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party which has three seats in the 650-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, strongly opposes the violent campaign. Its president, <PERSON> Dafydd </PERSON> <PERSON> Elis </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, has called the police `` most ineffective'' and urged the government to apply pressure for better results. The police say they lack evidence partly because the public is uncooperative. `` It's quite a big percentage who -LRB- a -RRB- obviously know something but do n't want to tell us, or -LRB- b -RRB- those who know something that they do n't know would help us,'' <PERSON> Hughes-Jones </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, brought under English rule by King <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> in 1282 and united with <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1536, has a long history of protest against its conquerors. In the 1960s, for example, a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welsh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> waged a violent anti-English campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> Welsh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for years has waged non-violent protest against English immigration, staging sit-ins in real estate offices and glueing their locks. Non-violent nationalists support measures such as limiting property sales to English newcomers and imposing higher taxes on second homes. The Sons of <LOCATION> Glendower </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Meibion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glyndwyr </ORGANIZATION>, take their name from <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Glendower </PERSON>, a 15th-century Welsh rebel leader. The group is believed to be responsible for most of the 150 arson incidents, counted primarily in rural, picturesque north <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> since the first attack, on a cottage in Mynydd Nefyn Dec. 13, 1979, police said. The group, which initially broke into empty homes and built simple fires, has made erratic phone calls and delivered letters claiming responsibity over the years. `` The target now -LRB- sic -RRB- the colonists and the capitalists,'' said a letter delivered to <ORGANIZATION> HTV </ORGANIZATION>, the Welsh television station, after recent attacks on a tackle shop and canoe gear store in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. `` They are the enemies of the people. Their free markets are killing <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. We demand justice.'' It was signed <PERSON> Rhys </PERSON> <PERSON> Gethin </PERSON>, who was a lieutenant of <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Glendower </PERSON>, police said. The extremists' most prominent public supporter is the Welsh poet R.S. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a retired minister, who earlier this year described them as the only true defenders of Welsh language and culture. <PERSON> Owain </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a founding member of a new nationalist movement called Y Cyfamodwyr, or the Covenanters, does n't go that far, but says he wo n't condemn <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' stance because `` the situation is desperate. It needs desperate measures.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> added: `` They are expected to lie down and take it as a streamroller crushes them west into the sea. We are becoming the dispossessed in our own land. This is our last foothold.'' The British government's <ORGANIZATION> Welsh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says it has no statistics showing how many of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>' 2.8 million people are English, but nationalists say their numbers are multiplying significantly. The English are believed to comprise less than 20 percent of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>' population but reliable statistics on their numbers and the migration trend are hard to come by because the British are not required to register their English or other nationality. But Welsh nationalists say the English immigrants' numbers are multiplying significantly. Middle-class English people are taking advantage of a property boom in southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to sell high at home and buy cheaper homes in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, which many believe to be an idyllic spot for raising a family, as well as for retirement, weekends and vacations. A recent revival of the Welsh economy has made it easier for the English to find jobs in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, and many of those who do n't find local employment choose to commute. Some go as far as <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which is about 200 miles to the southeast, or a train ride of about four hours from this coastal resort. Meanwhile, the percentage of people speaking Welsh, which is taught in schools and is highly visible on the nation's bilingual signs, has declined to 64 percent in the Welsh-speaking areas this year from 71.3 percent in 1981, a recent survey for <ORGANIZATION> HTV </ORGANIZATION> indicated. The survey also showed that 57 percent of the 1,000 people questioned in west and north <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> supported the aims of the Sons of <LOCATION> Glendower </LOCATION>, although only 6 percent endorsed the arson campaign.

<HEAD>Ayn Rand Epic Makes It to American Cinema 46 Years Late</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Theasa Tuohy</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an adventure with almost as many twists and plot turns as the movie itself, Ayn Rand's `` We the Living'' is about to make it to American theaters. The 46-year-old film was thought to have been destroyed by <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>. `` We The Living'' was made in war-time <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in 1942, and was based on the novel of the same name by Ayn Rand, whose `` objectivism'' philosphy in such works as `` The Fountainhead'' and `` Atlas Shrugged'' made her a cult figure in the 1970s. The movie has caused a stir over the years, and has repeatedly won critical acclaim, from the Venice Festival of 1942 to the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Annual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> last month. A surface indictment of communism, the lushly photographed, romantic saga is set in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> as the tidal wave of revolution boiled down to a new party system that meant enormous changes in the way people lived and loved and survived. <PERSON> Rossano </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazzi </PERSON> co-stars as a tubercular aristocat who ca n't get a job or a slot in a sanitarium because aristocrats are out of fashion. He said he made arrangements for Rand to get her first look at the film when he met her in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> after the war. However, he did n't think <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s fascist government had ordered the movie to be destroyed. It went out of circulation because the `` natural life of the film was over,'' <PERSON> Brazzi </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Massimo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrara-Santamaria </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> lawyer who was general manager of the studio where the movie was made, said he was called before a fascist tribunal and ordered to destroy negatives and copies of the film, and was stripped of his position at the studio and as lecturer at Italian universities for his role in making the movie. `` In the tragic Italian war situation, the film was called by the public ` <PERSON> Noi </PERSON> <PERSON> Morti </PERSON>' -LRB- ` We the Dead' -RRB-,'' he said in an interview, adding that Nazi propaganda minister <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Goebbels </PERSON> banned the film in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> personally showed it at <PERSON> Goebbels </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> home in October 1942 `` At the end of the screening, <PERSON> Goebbels </PERSON> told me that the Russians were habitually presented to the German public in a much more negative way than in this picture, and therefore it was no good for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Erika </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, the movie's producers, were Rand's lawyers in the 1960s Mrs. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said the author believed the banning story and authorized a search for the film that took the two attorneys through hundreds of interviews and dusty archives. It finally culminated two years later when they met a dealer with `` a bunch of Italian films for sale.'' They rode through the bumpy back streets of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> with a load of potentially explosive nitrate-treated film in the back of an old truck, including the negative for `` We the Living.'' They had the movie transferred to `` safety film'' before flying it back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> believes they found the original nitrate negative, which <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> had hidden. <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> and others say <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> ordered the film destroyed about five months after its release on the grounds that though the message might purport to be anti-communist, it could also be taken as anti-totalitarian _ a strong statement for individualism, regardless of political coloration. The fascists did n't want that kind of propaganda message playing on the homefront with <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Axis troops stretched from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION>, and the Allies storming the beaches of <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. Rand had a hard-line, libertarian philosophy. It was best exemplified by <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> in the `` Fountainhead,'' who played an architect who blows up his own creation rather than allow it to be desecrated by the whims of popularism. Mrs. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said Rand liked the film version of `` We the Living'' even more than `` The Fountainhead,'' although the author had written the latter's screenplay herself and was not asked for permission for the Italian film. <PERSON> Brazzi </PERSON> said it was a so-called war movie: `` We'll worry after the war about paying for it.'' He said Rand eventually did receive compensation from <PERSON> Scalera </PERSON>, the producing studio. Mrs. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said that once she and her husband recovered an original nitrate negative, Rand went through the film frame by frame to identify exactly how she wanted it edited. The Italian version was made in two parts and ran over 4 -LCB- hours. The project was set aside when Rand had other commitments, and was not picked up until after the author's death in 1982. The film was restored by <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. The epic was shot entirely on indoor, elaborately built Italian war-time sets recreating Russian country scenes, trains, ships and <LOCATION> Petrograd </LOCATION>. `` I'm told almost the entire White Russian community in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was used as extras,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said. The new version, distributed by <PERSON> Angelika </PERSON> <PERSON> Films </PERSON>, is under three hours, and is set for release Nov. 5 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, Nov. 11 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and Nov. 25 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It will play to other major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets before January. The film also stars a young and radiant <PERSON> Alida </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON>, the female lead in the 1949 British thriller, `` The Third Man''; and <PERSON> Fosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Giachetti </PERSON>, who was the No. 1 box-office draw in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> when the movie was made, according to its producers. `` We the Living'' has a bit of soap opera in it: Beautiful <PERSON> Kira </PERSON> loves <PERSON> Leo </PERSON>, the tubercular aristocat; <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> of the dreaded secret police loves <PERSON> Kira </PERSON> because she has the courage to be independent and defiant of the new order. But underneath the suds is a hard reality: <PERSON> Kira </PERSON> forsakes her love when he turns out not tough enough to toe a moral line. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> kills himself when he realizes first that <PERSON> Kira </PERSON> used him to get <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> a spot in a sanitarium, and that his adored party leaves no freedom for individuals to decide whether they wish to be scoundrel or saint. <PERSON> Kira </PERSON> goes forward, wiser but unbowed, a testimony to the strong and the living, and the survival of the toughest. Rand, who espoused a personal philosophy based on unfettered capitalism and `` rational selfishness,'' held individual freedom as the highest ideal. She said alturism was weakness, and blamed it for much of the world's woes. But she also attacked libertarians of the right who often identified with her philosophy.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ They go through bizarre rituals that caricature everyday behavior. They become puppets of a relentless compulsion and lose the capacity to trust their senses. The disorder, not as rare as one would think, has long been intractable, but now breakthroughs in drug and behavior therapy bring new hope to those so strangely afflicted. The first of two stories.

 Every morning for 20 years, April rose before dawn. While her family slept, April scrubbed: sinks, toilets, floors, doorknobs, an ever-growing list. Sometimes she ran through it twice. On bad days, she'd be halfway to work before realizing she'd forgotten something at home `` Once I went out, I was contaminated,'' she says. `` Going back in meant I had to shower, change clothes and clean house all over again.'' On <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s worst days, he spent hours darting about his apartment in panic. Was the door locked? Stove off? Window closed? Some days, he'd check for hours and still not be sure. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> had to count: the steps he took, the coins in his pocket, the times he chewed every bite. Though not superstitious, `` I was counting to make sure I did n't do anything 13 times,'' he says. `` If I did, I felt my father would die of a heart attack.'' April, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder, for centuries one of the most baffling and intractable mental illnesses. Throughout history, OCD sufferers from <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> have been slaves to the intrusive, irrational thoughts known as obsessions, and the senseless, repetitive rituals, or compulsions, that accompany them. Now, breakthroughs in drug treatment and behavior therapy are bringing new hope to <LOCATION> OCD </LOCATION> victims. The discoveries coincide with mounting evidence of a link between OCD and other neurological illnesses and movement disorders, such as some forms of epilepsy, <ORGANIZATION> Parkinson </ORGANIZATION>'s Disease, and <PERSON> Tourette </PERSON>'s Syndrome. Along with generating wide medical interest, the developments are helping ease the stigma long felt by <LOCATION> OCD </LOCATION> victims, who are seeking help in unprecedented numbers. As a result, researchers have concluded that the illness, once considered rare, is actually fairly common. `` Whether you know it or not,'' says one expert, `` you do know someone with this disease.'' Chances are, you do n't know it. OCD usually strikes healthy, sane people who are adept at hiding their symptoms from spouses, employers and friends. That they're able to do it is remarkable, given the debilitating nature of the illness: _ A respected accountant can not mail a letter without tearing it open to make sure his daughter is n't sealed inside. _ A skilled engineer ca n't drive to work without retracing his route over and over for fear he ran over a pedestrian on the way. _ A young housewife turns her basement into a repository for everything from used <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Litter </PERSON> to carpet lint, for reasons she's at a loss to explain Some conceal their behavior by distancing themselves emotionally and physically. Compared to the general public, people with OCD are nearly twice as likely not to marry and more likely to divorce if they do. Revised estimates now hold that the so-called `` doubting disease'' affects roughly 2 percent of the population, between 4 million and 6 million people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone. The majority of them are as aware _ and as ashamed _ of their aberrant behavior as they are powerless to stop it. `` Telling a person to stop washing or stop checking is like telling the average person to stop breathing,'' says <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON>, a wife and mother who says OCD stole 15 years of her life. Like others who agreed to discuss their illness, she asked that her last name not be used. <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON>'s illness began with a cancer obsession that sent her scurrying from doctor to doctor. `` I began having hysterical reactions, like worrying so much about getting a bump on my tongue that I would actually get a bump on my tongue.'' Abruptly, those fears vanished, replaced by something worse: relentless, incapacitating fears of losing control and stabbing her children. `` I had my suicide all planned,'' <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> says. `` I was going to lock myself in the garage and turn on my car.'' Instead, <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> sought treatment at a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> clinic. Like an estimated two-thirds of the OCD patients who undergo the new behavior therapy or drug treatment, she got better. Dr. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> is chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Obsessive-Compulsive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disorder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>. In three years of treating <LOCATION> OCD </LOCATION>, `` I have seen it go away, although most people are not totally free of symptoms. After therapy the obsessions are still there. The difference is they no longer have to perform the compulsions.'' Today, <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> estimates her illness is with her 2 percent of the time. She keeps it at bay with a small maintenance dose of an anti-depressant. When they do surface, she says, `` the thoughts are manageable and easily discarded.'' <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> now works full-time, attends graduate school, and helps run the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION> OCD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, an education, information and referral service she founded with a small group of patients. <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON>'s obsessions _ fear of disease and fear of harming others _ are among the most common, as are fear of death, dirt or germs; of harming oneself; of uttering obscenities or insults; of discarding something of great value. Others include perverse sexual or violent images, blasphemous thoughts, exaggerated fears of chemical or environmental contamination. Compulsions often include ritualistic washing or cleaning; counting to certain numbers or avoiding others; continually checking doors, windows, stoves; hoarding or collecting newspapers, mail, lint, string; arranging and rearranging drawers, closets, cupboards. Most people with OCD pass through a washing phase at some point during their illness. While specific obsessions may change over time, the themes tend to stay the same, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> says. For many patients, fear of cancer has been replaced by fear of AIDS, a disease `` made to order for OCD victims,'' one expert says. Dr. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapoport </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> believes that compulsive behavior _ handwashing, checking or counting _ actually comes first, followed by the obsession, or rationale for the behavior. `` Man is a rational being. When he finds himself doing something that looks purposeful _ for example, repeated washing _ his logical mind has to find a reason,'' she says.

 Obsessions and compulsions can turn up in families previously untouched by mental illness, but are more likely to cluster in families with histories of OCD or its frequent companion, depression. Although it affects men and women in equal numbers, children with OCD are twice as apt to be boys. It often strikes young adults, but many can recall bouts of obsessive behavior from childhood, and doctors have spotted it in children as young as 3. Obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors lurk beneath the surface in nearly everyone. Most people regard neatness and exactitude as desirable traits. And who has n't raced home to double-check an appliance, worried excessively about cancer, or gotten a tune `` stuck'' in his head? No one can pinpoint where meticulousness or rigidity leave off and illness begins. Still, the experts agree that the periodic preoccupations of everyday life bear little resemblance to the relentless, involuntary, all-consuming nature of OCD. At their worst, according to <PERSON> Rapoport </PERSON>, the habits of OCD patients `` become gross caricatures and distortions of useful everyday behavior.'' `` My patients fight exhausting battles with invisible germs daily, even hourly,'' <PERSON> Rapoport </PERSON> writes in `` The Boy Who Could n't Stop Washing,'' the first `` popular'' book on OCD, to be published by E.P <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> in January. <PERSON> Rapoport </PERSON>, who's been treating the illness since 1972, is hoping the book will lure more victims out of hiding. At the core of the doubting disease is `` the inability to be reassured by the senses,'' <PERSON> Rapoport </PERSON> writes. Somehow the message _ that the house is clean or the doors are locked _ does n't get through. `` In one way or another,'' she says, `` every patient with OCD wants to know how to know.'' Unlike gambling, overeating or other activities commonly labeled `` compulsive,'' OCD's senseless rituals bring no pleasure. `` I hated to count,'' says <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, a young shoe salesman. `` All I ever wanted was to stop.'' Like others with the illness, he had no choice but to keep counting: steps, stairs, shoes, everything. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>, a secretary in her 30s with flowing brown hair and a bubbly, outgoing manner, could n't stop cleaning, a compulsion that literally popped up overnight. `` One weekend when I was 21, I went away with my family,'' she recalls. `` We walked into a motel room, and everything felt dirty. When I brought my clothes home the next day, they felt dirty, too. That was the beginning.'' Soon, other things bothered <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>: `` The drugstore. The hospital. The garbage truck. Anything that had to do with germs or disease.'' On a good day, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> bathed with bar soap and water. On bad days, she scrubbed her skin raw with Lysol. `` I stashed Lysol all over the house, like an alcoholic hides booze. I carried it in my purse.'' Over time, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>'s life became more and more disrupted. Though lonely, she stayed away from her parents and turned down dates to protect others from her `` contamination.'' She did much of her work twice: once at the office and again at home, where she put on rubber gloves and copied everything over on `` clean'' paper. She bypassed the corner grocery and drove to distant supermarkets, so as not to contaminate any stores she might one day need to go back to. `` If I'd buy a new outfit, suddenly it would be contaminated. You either washed it to death or threw it out. I looked like hell. I could n't use makeup because I'd contaminate it, and how many times can you afford to throw away your makeup and buy all new stuff?'' April, whose symptoms were similar, became her own plumber and repairman. Her house was off-limits to all but her husband and sons; as soon as they got home at night, they were required to use the shower April had installed in the basement. Showering in the upstairs bathroom was forbidden. Though she had two children and a full-time teaching job, April could n't accept help with the housework. `` I would have no way of knowing what my husband had touched before he picked out our groceries or whatever.'' Her sons were n't allowed to go to movies or play in the yard but were confined to a concrete patio April hosed down each morning. At school, she could n't use the bathroom no matter how long her day, and she retreated to her classroom whenever hallways were crowded. If a student inadvertently bumped her, it would bother her for a week. `` What was life like? It was hell,'' says April, a neatly dressed middle-aged woman with short, graying hair, a tense mouth and reddened eyes that burn with sorrow. `` If you have a cancer or a heart condition, you can be consoled. With this, you'd be ostracized. You have to hide it. People would think my judgment is impaired, even though I'm a good teacher.'' Her eyes fill and her voice quavers as she recalls her medical history: `` I've been hospitalized, put on medications, given shock treatments. The psychiatrists said to restrain me. To take away all my buckets.'' Unlike April, who for 20 years never stopped seeking help, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> would still be hiding if a friend had n't found out and urged her to get treatment. Otherwise, she might never have known her terrible secret had a name. Many doctors do n't know either, often mistaking OCD for depression or schizophrenia. `` Physicians want to diagnose things they can treat,'' says <PERSON> Rapoport </PERSON>, who adds that until recently, her profession had little to offer OCD patients. For the time being, most doctors view OCD as a chronic illness that can be controlled but not cured. But given stepped-up research by scientists and drug companies around the world, the prognosis is increasingly hopeful. Meanwhile, April waits. After seven years of drug and behavior treatments, she feels more in control of the illness that has tormented her for 21 years. But she knows she has yet to break free. `` My son wants to come home from college for Thanksgiving and shower upstairs,'' she says sadly. `` I do n't think I'm ready for that.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's called obsessive-compulsive disorder and is as unpleasant as it sounds, forcing victims to irrational repetitions of such mundane tasks as cleaning and washing. It has been a hard disease for therapists to outwit, but they are succeeding now through ingenious methods. One is `` flooding'' patients with the fears that drive their compulsions.

 Gathering dog hair, directing home movies and simulating storms are n't part of a typical therapist's repertoire. But for <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Beidel </PERSON>, such things are often all in a day's work. Turner and <PERSON> Beidel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>'s Western Ptute and Clinic are among a growing number of specialists who are using behavior therapy to tresychiatric Instiat victims of obsessive-compulsive disorder, a mysterious illness of senseless, repetitive rituals driven by runaway doubts. People with OCD often engage in excessive cleaning, counting or checking, to ease intense fears of contamination, disease or other catastrophe. Much of their energy typically goes into hiding their illness from others. Until recently, OCD, which affects about 2 percent of the population, was considered among the most treatment-resistant tments and new therapeutic techniques pioneered in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. At the Anxiety Disorders Clinic run by the university's medical school, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beidel </PERSON> treat OCD patients by `` flooding'' them with exposure to the very objects, images or events they fear most. The patients are then prevented from carrying out their compulsions. `` The theory behind flooding is that the stimuli that has the ability to produce anxiety loses that ability through repeated exposure,'' says <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, an associate professor of psychiatry. For a woman obsessed with contamination caused by animals, treatment meant enduring a lapful of dog hair, followed by exposure to a dog. After touching the hair and petting the dog, the patient was not allowed to carry out her washing compulsions. Later, a therapist visited the patient at home, where she had routinely spent up to 18 hours a day cleaning. Together, patient and therapist made their way through the house, touching doors, walls, clothes, towels and sheets. Although the sessions made her anxious and upset, the woman agreed not to clean or wash afterward. The anxiety gradually diminished, and the need to perform the rituals faded. Finally, the woman completed her treatment by bringing a friend's cat into her home and playing with it. Just as obsessions and compulsions vary from one patient to another, so do the treatments <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beidel </PERSON> concoct. One former patient was obsessed with thunderstorms, to the extent that darkness or even clouds made him frantic. Because of the unpredictable nature of real thunderstorms, his therapists re-created one, using taped sound effects and narration. For a woman who served meals in the basement for fear of contaminating the kitchen, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beidel </PERSON> made a videotape of family members `` eating in the kitchen, smashing crackers with their feet, really messing things up.'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who's been treating OCD patients since 1980, says behavior therapy might reduce a patient's primary symptoms in as little as three to five months. But often, considerable follow-up may be needed. `` They have to learn their limits for handling stress. We try to help them recognize what constitutes stresses for them, since the illness often follows periods of emotional distress,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> says. People who have spent years in self-imposed exile may need help with interpersonal skills. Others may need marital therapy to repair years of damage done by their illness. In addition, says <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, compulsions can take up huge chunks of time. Patients who get better often need help figuring out how to fill their days more productively. The prognosis may depend on the extent to which the patient believes his obsession is real. Other factors include `` what else is wrong in their lives, and how socially adjusted they are,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> says. Turner describes the therapy as unorthodox and time-consuming. `` But the response can be very dramatic,'' he says. `` As a rule, they do get better.'' Like others, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> often combines the therapy with drug treatment. Many patients have shown dramatic improvement in controlled studies of drugs such as Anafranil and more recently, Fluoxetine and Fluvoxamine. All are powerful anti-depressants that affect serotonin, a chemical transmitter within the brain. Laboratory rats with altered serotonin display ritualistic `` checking'' behavior that resembles compulsions. Fluvoxamine and Anafranil, or clomipramine as it's known generically, are available in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on an investigational basis only. Fluoxetine, -LRB- trade name Prozac -RRB-, is available for use in depression. Experts point out that it's worth trying all three, since not all of them work for all patients. That the illness responds both to drugs and to therapy is a puzzle to researchers. But the pieces are beginning to fall into place. Harsh discipline, premature toilet training and unresolved Oedipal conflicts have long been considered prime suspects in OCD. Today, all findings point to a new culprit: biology. <PERSON> Freud </PERSON> himself had suspected as much. Until 30 or 40 years ago, though, the worst cases were treated with lobotomies and-or hospitalization, replaced over the next 20 years by psychotherapy or psychoanalysis, neither of which did much good. The old theories began to give way during the'70s, when sophisticated diagnostic tools brought a heightened emphasis on the link between physiology and mental illness. The result has been a wealth of new evidence culled from laboratory research, drug testing and interviews with OCD victims. Among the most compelling arguments is the connection between OCD and <PERSON> Tourette </PERSON>'s Syndrome, a disease marked by involuntary tics, multiple motor movements and the uncontrollable blurting of sounds, phrases and in some cases, obscenities. Obsessions and compulsions occur in one-third of all cases of <PERSON> Tourette </PERSON>'s, a disease of the basal ganglia, the main relay station between sensory information, learned behavior and motor movement. Positron Emission Testing -LRB- PET -RRB- scans, diagnostic tools that enable researchers to study the working brain, have revealed abnormalities in areas of OCD patients' brains that correspond to areas affected by <PERSON> Tourette </PERSON>'s. `` If anyone's been skeptical, the relationship between OCD and <PERSON> Tourette </PERSON>'s really settled it,'' says <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Obsessive-Compulsive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disorder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. One emerging theory holds that OCD may trigger `` fixed action patterns,'' sequences of primitive behaviors that, while no longer relevant to 20th-century life, continue to be stored within the brain. Dr. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapoport </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, a pioneer in OCD treatment, sees models for human compulsions throughout the animal world _ in the hoarding behavior of squirrels, for example, or the grooming rituals of rats. Among the most valuable resources for researchers are the growing numbers of OCD victims coming forward for treatment. But many more remain hidden away. `` Typically, they do n't camp on your door,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> says. `` Two percent of the population is still a huge number of people. We're not seeing them.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Growing herds of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sea lions that converge on Puget Sound each fall are becoming a nuisance, raiding the fisheries and getting in the way of divers. It's a Catch 22 for environmentalists that the law intended to protect endangered marine mammals also has produced a threat to some endangered fish.

 Fishermen, divers and coastal residents on Puget Sound are being frustrated by large herds of sea lions and harbor seals feasting on bottom fish, salmon and endangered steelhead trout headed upstream to spawn. The federal law that protects endangered whales and other marine mammals prohibits killing the sea lions which kill and eat more than half of the steelhead run each year. Up to 2,000 sea lions converge on Puget Sound each fall and their numbers are on the rise, wildlife experts say. In addition to their threat to the fisheries, floats designed as divers' rest spots are typically crowded with barking sea lions, and at least one ferry dock has reeked from their droppings. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sea lions arrive from their sunny summer climes off <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in October and November and stay in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> into April and May before migrating back south. Sea lions and harbor seals, which reside year-round in the same area, have flourished under the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, originally designed to save whales, sea otters, and other marine mammals, including some seals and sea lions, whose numbers were decimated over the past 100 years. `` People like to watch the bears at <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, but if they get into the garbage cans or pose a threat they are taken and removed, and if they return once or twice, the animals are destroyed,'' says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> of Trout Unlimited in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` One learns it from the other. You have to learn to eliminate the ones that have learned to go to the garbage dump.'' The learning process that brings bears to dumps in parks is the same learning process that has attracted sea lions to the <LOCATION> Ballard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Locks </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, where salmon and steelhead must use a fish ladder to gain access to fresh waters of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the streams where they spawn. Once one sea lion learns the fish are easy pickings, he brings his buddies, scientists say. `` It's just got worse and worse since 1980,'' says <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>. She said that while a few sea lions used to show up, up to 26 sea lions are expected to be on hand at the fish ladder when steelhead start running this month. Last winter, about 800 wild steelhead managed to spawn, with sea lions blamed for killing more than that number. The previous winter, less than 500 fish escaped to spawn. A group of commercial and sport fishermen had sought changes in the Marine Mammal Protection Act this year that would have allowed federal fisheries managers to shoot sea lions that encroached on the fish. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavletich </PERSON> of the Salmon and <ORGANIZATION> Steelhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unlimited </ORGANIZATION> notes that various efforts to chase away the sea lions or net off the fish ladder approach, have failed. Unless the sea lions are somehow driven off, he says, the endangered wild steelhead could be goners. Despite efforts by fishermen, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decided against giving managers the option of killing the sea lions. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refused to bite the bullet,'' <PERSON> Pavletich </PERSON> says. `` It's understandable. It's a very emotional issue. There is strong support to protect marine mammals at any cost. Even at the cost of our fisheries resources, and that is unfortunate.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did, however, continue the act five more years, and is calling for research into fisheries and mammal resources in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, a move that some fish managers applauded. A large environmental coalition, led by <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, also was pleased with the outcome in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Deeble </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> ocean ecology campaigner for <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, says <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> simply did n't believe the marine mammals should be subject to control by lethal means because of the one problem case in Puget Sound. <PERSON> Pavletich </PERSON> says the law allows parties to petition for a review of marine mammal populations and the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> could authorize shooting the sea lions in some cases. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Scordino </PERSON>, marine mammal coordinator for the Northwest regional office of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, says the sea lion has n't been endangered since it was hunted in the 1920s. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, says he would like to see a regional management council for marine mammals, like the fisheries commission, to develop a policy on marine mammal management. According to Scordino, an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 sea lions feed in Puget Sound each year, from fall to spring. Each year, their numbers and the length of their stay appear to be on the rise, <PERSON> Scordino </PERSON> says. There may be as many as 4,000 more sea lions fattening up each winter in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, and as many as 157,000 may inhabit West Coast waters altogether. While direct links between sea lions and hake, or whiting, stocks have n't been established, <PERSON> Cyreis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, a state fisheries marine biologist, said the fishery has plunged from an estimated 45 million pounds in 1983 to 14 million pounds this year. She said the fishery may have to be closed for a couple of years if it's to be saved. Sea lions were estimated to have eaten up to 2 million pounds of hake this year, while fishermen were allowed to take only 500,000 pounds. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearin </PERSON>, biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, says hake, a much slower fish than salmon or steelhead, was found in 68 percent of sea lion scat studied in the sound in 1987. Meanwhile, harbor seal populations in Northwest coastal waters have increased 10 percent a year since 1976. They forage freely in areas where they used to be shot by fishermen, <PERSON> Scordino </PERSON> says. More than 75 percent of the gill-net salmon fisheries at <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Willapa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> are being destroyed by harbor seals, he says, adding, `` I think we're just seeing the tip of the iceberg.'' Fortunately, <PERSON> Scordino </PERSON> says, tackling sea lion nuisance problems unrelated to fisheries has been a lot easier. Large timber floats for divers at the Edmonds Underwater Park were recently replaced with smaller foam floats that the basking, barking sea lions ca n't leap onto. A floating platform at the local ferry dock has been fenced off, so the stench from the beasts is dissipating.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ In the large colonies of Hmong refugees in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, police are noticing a dramatic increase in the use of opium, a powerful narcotic that was part of the culture in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Federal customs agents have seized 450 shipments of opium bound for <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> in the past five years and they figure that's only a fraction of the amount that got through.

 In the cold-cream containers mailed to <PERSON> Xiong </PERSON> <PERSON> Yer </PERSON> <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs inspectors discovered globs of a black, tar-like substance. It was opium, police say, a powerful narcotic from which heroin and morphine are derived. It's also part of a culture many Hmong refugees were n't willing to leave behind in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Federal and local authorities say opium smoking is on the rise in Hmong communities across the country. `` It's very cheap, very available, and we're seeing more young people addicted,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Westermeyer </PERSON>, who oversees the treatment of Hmong opium addicts at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` It looks like the coming thing,'' says police Lt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where police recently pulled more than 5,000 red and violet opium poppies from a Hmong family's backyard garden. `` We expect a lot of the Hmong community are using opium because it's an accepted practice in their own country. We're just trying to be more aware of what's happening in the Hmong community, communicate to them that it is not accepted.'' The Hmong, who fought on the American side during the Vietnam War, fled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from their native <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> by the tens of thousands after the end of the war. No one knows how many Hmong refugees are smoking opium, but experts say the stress of adjusting to a radically different environment accelerates the slide toward addiction. `` The stress, frustrations, prejudices, language problem and family problems probably contribute'' to heavy opium use, says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, a Hmong community services officer with the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The drug hinders the process of learning to succeed in a new culture. `` In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, I have never seen an opium user who has a full-time job,'' <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> says. `` They are taking food literally out of their families' mouths,'' adds Westermeyer, an expert on Hmong culture who spent a decade working in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> `` They're not learning the language, not learning to survive.'' <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, with about 20,000 Hmong, and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, with about 12,000, have the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> populations of the refugees from the mountains and jungles of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. Smaller Hmong communities are scattered around the country in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and elsewhere. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> police gained a new appreciation of the opium problem last winter when federal customs agents showed them a computer printout of 450 Minnesota-bound shipments seized in the last five years, says police Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON>, head of the narcotics unit. The seized shipments _ believed to be only a small fraction of the number that made it through _ ranged in size from a few ounces to more than 10 pounds. <PERSON> Khang </PERSON>, 39, whom police believe is a major opium supplier to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s Hmong, is awaiting trial on a charge of narcotics possession with intent to distribute, as well as a federal narcotics importation charge. Authorities arrested him in March after intercepting the cold-cream shipment and then keeping his home under surveillance. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> authorities worry that seizures have n't kept pace with the flow of the drug into the area. There is just one other opium case pending in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> now, <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> says. There have been only about 10 opium arrests in the Twin Cities area in the last decade, says <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs narcotics group supervisor in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, seizures of opium `` have increased substantially over the last couple years,'' says <PERSON> Orve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, resident agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> office. `` What were once a few ounces now are 10 pounds or so at a time,'' he says. Police have sometimes been overly tolerant of opium use by the Hmong. `` There was a feeling, ` How can you prosecute this poor old man who fled his country and brought his custom with him?''' <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> says. `` And how do you prosecute someone who does n't realize he broke the law?'' In his 1983 book, `` Poppies, Pipes and People: Opium and Its Use in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>,'' Westermeyer notes that opium is commonly used as medicine by a native population short on doctors and pharmacies. And by custom, he says, respectable households keep some on hand for guests and special occasions. But <PERSON> Westermeyer </PERSON> maintains that heavy use of the poppy's fruit is no more accepted in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> than it is here. In contrast to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, police in <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, report no opium problems in their sizable Hmong communities. `` The Hmong people in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> have acclimated very well,'' says <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION> police Capt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Foust </PERSON>. `` To my knowledge, there is no opium use. Either that or we're not on the ball.'' <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> says, `` We know there's a lot of it coming in, but we do n't see the problem on the street. `` There's always the possibility it will seep out of the Hmong community into the general population. Then we do have a problem.'' End Adv for Sunday, Nov. 13

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> prosecutor with a penchant for performing, getting his message across to the jury with a few lines from a song. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> does n't claim to be another <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>, or even a Prince, but to him singing is more effective than boring speeches.

 They call him the singing prosecutor, a legal eagle given to serenading the judge and jury. His trials, one critic says, `` have taken a turn for the verse.'' A judge complains that singing in court makes light of serious business. No matter, says Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Petro </PERSON>, singing often beats a lot of talking. `` I do n't fancy myself a singer, but I think it's an effective means of communication,'' <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> says. In recent months, the 55-year-old prosecutor has entertained courtrooms in southwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> with excerpts from `` Home Sweet Home,'' `` Moonlight and Roses'' and `` Pennies from Heaven.'' `` A trial attorney can be very effective if he uses references to literature or poetry that are known by everybody,'' <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> says. `` Frankly, I do n't think there's anything different in reciting, say, a famous quotation or excellent poem than singing a couple lines of a song. After all, when you think about it, the best writers of concise English are really the lyricists.'' His latest, tuneful tour de force came during the September trial of a woman charged with stealing two country music cassettes from a department store. `` Every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven,'' <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> crooned during his opening argument. `` Do n't you know each cloud contains, pennies from heaven. You'll find your fortune falling all over town.'' He suddenly switched from song to speech, without missing a beat. `` Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the defendant's fortune was falling all over <ORGANIZATION> Gee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION>,'' he recalls telling the jury. Then, he says, `` I went into the facts.'' `` Singing helps to focus the jury's attention to certain things and to listen to the arguments,'' <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> says. `` But in the great majority of cases, the jury will follow the facts.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrew </PERSON>, jury foreman for the retail theft trial, said the guilty verdict, indeed, was based on testimony and evidence. `` Singing just did n't seem appropriate, but that's my opinion. We did n't discuss it,'' says <PERSON> McGrew </PERSON>, 49, who manages a welding and fabricating business. Juror <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON>, 71, a retired feed mill worker, laughed out loud and slapped his knee when <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> broke into `` Pennies from Heaven.'' `` I was surprised. You very seldom hear anybody singing that song,'' <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> says, chuckling. `` Everybody was laughing. Something new, you know?'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> was not amused. It was the second time <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> had burst into song in his courtroom. `` I do n't think anything he's done has been prejudicial or I would have stopped it,'' <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> says. `` My only objection is that it makes light of what is a very serious matter.'' The Observer-Reporter newspaper noted on the editorial page following the retail theft trial that <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> `` has done nothing really wrong here, other than to trivialize the judicial system.'' `` Save us from the singing prosecutor,'' the headline pleaded. His trials take `` a turn for the verse,'' Managing Editor <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON> wrote. Criticism, much of it tongue-in-cheek, also has come from defense attorneys. One lawyer suggested that <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> consider `` Jailhouse Rock.'' `` Of course, that's not my speed nor would I,'' <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> said. `` That would be inappropriate.'' <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> insists his musical selections always are relevant, thankfully few and far between, and in good taste. He chose `` Home Sweet Home'' for his opening argument in a February murder trial before <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, his courtroom singing debut, to `` indicate this great tragedy occurred in a guy's home.'' `` It just seemed right to sing,'' says <PERSON> Petro </PERSON>, a baritone. `` I did n't bother to ask anybody. Probably it's a good thing I did n't. They would have said, ` You're nuts.''' In May, <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> put on another a cappella performance, this time the first line of `` Moonlight and Roses,'' to show that an alleged burglary occurred on a moonlit night. `` Pennies from Heaven'' was <PERSON> Petro </PERSON>'s most spontaneous rendition. He decided to give the defendant `` some special treatment'' for fear she might be acquitted because of the relative insignificance of the alleged crime. In all three instances, `` it's something I've felt is appropriate,'' he says. `` I feel it's proper. It's not demeaning. We're not reducing the courtroom to a variety show.'' <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> is modest about his signing talents. `` I've sung in the church choir, but I've never pretended to be a soloist,'' he says. Every time he's sung, he's won. As a result, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettit </PERSON> does n't object. `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> does a good job,'' <PERSON> Pettit </PERSON> says. `` I entrust to him some of the more difficult and complicated cases that come into the office. If from time to time he feels a certain thing is going to aid him in making the jury understand his point, then I certainly do n't see anything wrong with it.'' For Petro, verse is superior to verbosity. `` I do n't know if you've ever bothered to read court opinions,'' he says. `` They're not considered great literature. I mean, they're well-written But they're not the type of material that really stimulates people.'' Singing, on the other hand, `` is very effective. I think the people like it. No question about it because, unfortunately, too many speeches in the courtroom are boring.'' <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> has no idea when or what he'll sing next. `` To use a pun,'' he says, `` you've got to play it by ear.''

 <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> is n't rich or famous, according to the foremost authority on the subject _ <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>. `` To be rich you have got to start at $ 50 million,'' says the host and creator of the syndicated television show, `` Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.'' And although <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> ca n't go to the local supermarket without being accosted by autograph seekers, he does n't consider himself a celebrity. `` I am two people. I sit and watch the show and that's a cartoon character I see on the screen,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> says in an interview at his home on a lake in this western <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> city. As the man responsible for persuading millionaires and celebrities to open their homes and reveal their bank balances in televised interviews, the 47-year-old <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> has made the elite and their toys his specialty. The son of an office manager, <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> left school at age 15. He was working as a night news editor for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> when he became disillusioned with his low wages and decided to take a year off. `` I'd never been to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and I'd never been to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and I flipped a coin and it came out heads for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' says the native of <LOCATION> Harrow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` It was the biggest giggle, it was the biggest adventure of my life.'' He arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> 25 years ago with just $ 135. `` I did not know a soul. I had no contacts. I had no nothing,'' he says. But within a day, he had changed his mind about staying for just one year. `` It was one of those things that I could never explain, that I could never put into words, but I felt that I had arrived home,'' he says. After a three-month stint selling shoes at a department store, <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> went to work for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. He later started his television career reporting for the morning shows on <ORGANIZATION> KABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He joined <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` People Tonight'' in 1980 and went on to become a reporter for `` Entertainment Tonight.'' `` Lifestyles'' was launched in 1983. From the time he started work as a newspaper reporter, <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> has been interested in the world of entertainment, attributing his fascination to the `` strange and interesting'' people who populate it. A divorced father of three sons, <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> now travels more than 300,000 miles a year to film `` Lifestyles'' and its offshoots, `` Runaway With The Rich and Famous,'' and `` Fame, Fortune and Romance.'' All three programs are produced by <ORGANIZATION> Televison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Telerep </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Lifestyles'' airs in 19 countries, including <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, which finally bought the show this year. <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>'s three-bedroom home is a long way from the shabby hotel room with a hot plate he rented the day he arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But compared to the opulence of `` Lifestyles,'' he lives modestly. There is a sunken bathtub in his bedroom, a whirlpool bath in an annex off the kitchen, and two jet skis bob on the lake at the end of an `` English'' flower garden. The wine in the cellar, however, is from local vineyards and a solitary <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is parked in the driveway. <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> attributes the success of `` Lifestyles'' to hard work and the American Dream. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has always been basically and traditionally a country where winning is very important,'' he says. `` The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dream </ORGANIZATION> is very much alive and well. Entrepreneurial behavior, where hard work is rewarded with success, is the only system in the world that works.'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> works 16 to 17 hours a day, seven days a week, as the executive producer and part owner of the three television shows. As for being a television show host, he says, `` It's a job like anyone else's job. `` The difference is that I do n't take what I do very seriously. How can you? It's not brain surgery, we're not saving lives. We are not doing anything constructive. `` It's entertainment to make people smile and laugh or to nudge their neighbors and say, ` Is n't that disgusting?''' He assumed the role of host reluctantly when he could find no one suitable to do the job, and then cultivated a voice that would ensure that his listeners stayed tuned. <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>'s loud, brash, made-for-televison English accent has become a trademark of `` Lifestyles.'' `` Some people actually think it's nice,'' he says. `` That's extraordinary It's not meant to be nice.'' He says the knack of getting people to appear on his shows boils down to the fact that he was often the first one to ask. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> are the only famous people whom <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> is still anxious to interview. But he says he has n't even scratched the surface of potential guests. Moreover, with plans for two new shows and contracts for two books, including a cookbook of recipes enjoyed by the rich and famous, there is plenty ahead for <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>. A memoir will come later, says <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, who eventually wants to retire to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and write. `` There is no burning <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> novel inside me, but just one book of all the madness that went on in the world of the rich and famous,'' he says.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Unlike other proud fighting units in World War II, such as the paratroopers and PT boat crews, the glider pilots have been all but forgotten. The National World War <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glider </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which has about 1,300 members and was instrumental in establishing a Silent Wings Museum in <LOCATION> Terrell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is dedicated to correcting that oversight.

 They were called the silent wings. The men who flew them had a `` G'' _ for guts _ emblazoned on the silver wings they wore on their uniforms. `` The mass of Americans do n't know a thing about the gliders,'' says <PERSON> Bard </PERSON> <PERSON> Coatsworth </PERSON> of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, a former state commander of the National World War II Glider Pilots Association. `` I decided it's time that we stop sitting around telling old war stories and let the world know about the contribution of gliders to the war effort.'' Gliders owe their military history to the Germans, who were banned as part of the Versailles Treaty from manufacturing aircraft with engines, <PERSON> Coatsworth </PERSON> said. `` They used them to fly demolition experts across the lines into <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> at night to destroy the pillboxes and guardposts.'' <PERSON> Coatsworth </PERSON> was working at the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> _ the same place <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON> learned to fly _ when he heard the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was looking for experienced pilots for glider training. He signed up in July 1942 and wound up at <ORGANIZATION> Ong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Goodland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, where he got 25 hours of training, landing without power from various altitudes, day and night. From there, it was on to two air bases in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and more night and day dead-stick flying, with some practice in gliders made from converted power aircraft. He got his first glimpse of the Waco CG4A -LRB- C for combat, G for glider -RRB- in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and remembers wondering, `` How could anybody fly a thing like this.'' The gilder, with a wingspan of 83 feet, 8 inches, an overall length of 48 feet, 3 -RCB- inches, and a height of 12 feet and 7-odd inches, `` looked like a big olive green bomber,'' he says. It was n't designed to be pretty. `` It was an aerial truck,'' <PERSON> Coatsworth </PERSON> says, `` but the power pilots who criticized it did n't know what they were missing. It handled like a dream.'' Although the war ended before <PERSON> Coatsworth </PERSON> had to fly a glider in combat, he did have some rather harrowing experiences during training. Once the tow rope broke loose from the power aircraft pulling the glider and narrowly missed breaking the windshield of the glider. The rope became tangled around the landing gear and <PERSON> Coatsworth </PERSON> had to maneuver the craft through a clearing in some trees to land. Snagging the rope would have resulted in a crash, he said. On a night run, <PERSON> Coatsworth </PERSON> and his co-pilot had to cut free because they were incorrectly signaled that the tow plane was in trouble. <PERSON> Coatsworth </PERSON> and his co-pilot had a choice of landing on a highway with traffic or at a rock quarry. `` We set it down about 20 feet short of the edge of the quarry, in snake-infested country,'' he says. `` We spent the night on the wing until they found us in the morning.'' <PERSON> Coatsworth </PERSON>, assigned to the 66th Squadron of the 403rd <ORGANIZATION> Troop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carrier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the CG4A could carry 13 soldiers and a crew of two. Some carried mini-bulldozers, Jeeps or mortars. The gliders were first used in the war on July 9, 1943, when they carried British airborne troops from an airfield in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> to Axis-held <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. In February 1944, gliders carried troops and equipment behind enemy lines in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> to set up landing areas to be used in a massive air assault that surprised the Japanese. Gliders played a key role in the D-day invasion of <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> on June 6, 1944, and saw action in southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bastogne </LOCATION> and Varsity. `` They were slated to join forces for a final airborne assault on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> proper, but we dropped the big one before it came to that,'' <PERSON> Coatsworth </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Coatsworth </PERSON> says the National World War II Glider Pilots Association, formed in 1971, has about 1,300 members. He estimates there were probably 10,000 men trained to fly gliders. The association was instrumental in establishing a Silent Wings Museum in <LOCATION> Terrell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, where people can view one of several restored CG4A gliders and other memorabilia. `` My big concern now is that we get our proper place in history,'' <PERSON> Coatsworth </PERSON> says. `` All the other services _ the paratroopers, the PT boat crews, and the like _ have gotten theirs, and I do n't deny them that. But it's time now for the country to recognize the glider pilots.''

 <LOCATION> LOS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> ANGELES </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` War and Remembrance,'' the sequel to `` The Winds of War,'' is more of a megaseries than a miniseries. Filmed at a cost of $ 104 million, it will run at least 30 hours, making it the most expensive and the longest-running film project of all time. The first 18 hours will be televised on seven nights over an 11-day period beginning Sunday. The final 12 hours are still being edited for showing after the first of the year. However, the exact number of hours will not be determined until the editing is completed. `` The Winds of War'' and `` War and Remembrance'' are based on the best-selling novels by <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wouk </PERSON>. The first told of the coming of World War II. The second is about the winning of the war. The first miniseries ran 18 hours in February 1983 and attracted an estimated 140 million viewers. The sequel, which includes 1,785 scenes, was filmed at 267 locations in six countries over a 14-month period. It has 358 speaking parts. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON> continues his role as <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> `` Pug'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, the naval officer who was on the scene for many of the events leading up to the war in `` The Winds of War.'' In the new show he is promoted to admiral and participates in the major sea battles in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. But the sequel also will feature some new faces in starring roles. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochner </PERSON>, rejected as too young for `` The Winds of War,'' grew into the role for the sequel. Nearly eight years ago, <PERSON> Bochner </PERSON> met with producer-director <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> to talk about the role of <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, the youngest son of <PERSON> Pug </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, who marries <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGraw </PERSON> -RRB- in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> just as World War II begins. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> felt I was too young,'' <PERSON> Bochner </PERSON> says. Instead, the role in the 1983 miniseries went to <PERSON> Jan-Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bochner </PERSON> picks up the role of <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> a few days after <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. He is a submarine officer in action in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON>, who is Jewish, is trapped in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and is trying to stay one step ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON>, now played by <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, is accompanied by their child, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>, and her Uncle <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>. Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> takes over the role of <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON> from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Topol </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> return in their roles from the first miniseries. The story, <PERSON> Bochner </PERSON> says, `` focuses on the family and how their lives are affected by the war.'' `` You do n't get just an overview,'' he says. `` You get details because somebody from the family is usually there. You see me in the submarine, my dad on the battleships, <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, my sister's husband at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> developing the bomb.'' Since completing the miniseries, <PERSON> Bochner </PERSON> has also starred with <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> in `` Die Hard'' and went to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> for a psychological thriller called `` Apartment Zero.'' <PERSON> Bochner </PERSON>, the son of actor <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochner </PERSON>, made his film debut during his college freshman year as one of the sons of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> in `` Islands in the Stream.'' He did n't work again until he graduated, then played the bad guy in `` Breaking Away.'' He has worked mostly in feature films and miniseries. This is the third miniseries <PERSON> Bochner </PERSON> has been opposite <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>. In the first, `` East of Eden,'' he was her son. In the second, `` The Sun Also Rises,'' he was her love interest. And in `` War and Remembrance,'' they are married. `` I was working on ` Making Mr. Right' when I signed for the role,'' he says. `` I read the books to get acquainted with the character. I'd never seen ` Winds of War' because I was out of the country when it came out. So I stayed away from it. I wanted to have my own interpretation. `` Byron in the beginning is not terribly focused. For lack of a better reason, he gets involved in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> because of parental pressure. He had been studying art in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It was his boyishness and brashness and passion that appealed to this older woman.'' <PERSON> Bochner </PERSON> spent several months in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the sequences in which he becomes a naval courier and attempts to find his wife and child. But most of his scenes are at sea aboard submarines. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has only two World War II diesel submarines, so it was necessary to tow a boat on display at <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> out to sea. To prepare for the role, <PERSON> Bochner </PERSON> spent a week aboard a nuclear submarine operating off <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` When we shot the battle sequences I thought at first something had gone wrong with the special effects,'' says <PERSON> Bochner </PERSON>. `` The explosions were so powerful. They rocked the whole boat. `` We filmed under some pretty tough conditions. The temperature inside the sub never got below 110 degrees. We worked 15 hours a day. Our objective was to re-create life exactly as it was on a submarine _ hot, exhausting and frightening.''

 When actress <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> first tried to land the role of <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lune </PERSON>,'' she could n't even get an audition. <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON>, a wary, never-married waitress in a definitely down-scale diner, was n't anything like <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, the divorced, working mother of two girls on TV's `` One Day at a Time,'' the role Miss <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> played for nine years. Casting directors, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> says, `` think that's who you are, rather than what you play. It's real frustrating because I know what I can do.'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>, the original <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON>, were replaced by <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitz </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weitz </PERSON> decided to leave, Miss <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> put in another, this time successful, appeal to audition. Miss <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Musante </PERSON>, known from TV's `` Toma,'' went into `` <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON>'' on Sept. 13, after three weeks' rehearsal They're enjoying the collaboration so much they want to work together again. `` We're so lucky,'' she says. `` There're only two of us out there on stage. The trust has to be extraordinary. It could have been we did n't trust each other and did n't get along.'' The play is about the relationship between a waitress and a short-order cook. He decides on their first date they should become a couple. She, having been physically hurt and then dumped by a longtime lover, wants a man in her life but is afraid to allow herself to be vulnerable again. `` It's a wonderful play,'' Miss <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> says. `` The more I do it, the more I love it.'' Audiences identify with <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON>, Miss <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> says. `` She is afraid to be left, damaged and hurt again in her life. I think elements of that are in all of us. `` <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> pushes so hard. Men do n't want to see themselves as steamrollers. But he's saying ` Love me; let me into your life.' He finally tells her, ` I'm not good with people.' `` I think people get things from the play, wherever their own pain is _ children, marriage, commitment or whatever. This is such a love story. We've all had successes and failures in that part of our lives. I think that's what affects so many people. And <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> writes so beautifully, in a certain poetic rhythm.'' She saw the play originally, Miss <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> says, after her husband of eight years, producer <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Minoff </PERSON>, saw it with his daughter. `` I loved it,'' she says. `` I knew I would be wonderful in it and I wanted to play it. I knew the director, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>. We both worked in <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>'s factory. He was in ` The <ORGANIZATION> Jeffersons </ORGANIZATION>' for nine years as the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative `` I called him and said, ` I saw your play and I want to replace <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>.' He said, ` I'll put you on a list.' The producers did n't see me. Maybe it was because of ` One Day at a Time.' I would n't be playing the mother of two kids.'' Miss <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> recalls that after her Broadway debut in the musical `` Applause'' she had trouble being considered for anything other than musicals. She thought she'd have lots of time to see movies and friends while acting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Miss <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> says, but finds that only from noon till 4 p.m. can she `` have a life other than the work.'' She starts preparing for the play about 4 p.m. `` I take a nap. I get up and wash my hair. I think it is important for the show that my hair not have a real stylish cut. I bought an ankle bracelet, three rings and earrings and painted my toenails. That's all <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON>. `` I take a good, strong half-hour walk to the theater. When I get there, I light a candle, put on classical music and do vocal exercises. There's a lot of talking in this play.'' Asked about the future, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> says, `` I know I'm going back home to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in January. I think it's important I have a marriage. I would n't mind going back on TV. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> and I are hoping we'll get <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> to write us a series.''

<DATELINE>GOVERNADOR VALADARES, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Ronaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perim </PERSON> readily acknowledges it: at least 30,000 residents of <LOCATION> Governador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valadares </LOCATION> _ a tenth of its population _ are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, most illegally, and others are doing everything they can to follow them. They do n't want to stay there, he indicated _ just make their fortunes `` in the land of opportunity'' and return home to live in the financial comfort that escapes many Brazilians in these days of economic hardship. In August, 46 Brazilians were discovered stowed away amid sacks of cocoa beans and coffee on a cargo ship docked in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Forty were from <PERSON> Governado </PERSON> <PERSON> Valadares </PERSON>. Of the stowaways, nine escaped from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration officials and the rest, who were sent home, vowed to try again. A lot of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rubbed off on <PERSON> Governador </PERSON> <PERSON> Valadares </PERSON>. English commonly is heard along with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s Portuguese language on its tree-lined streets and in it cheery one-family homes. Goods can be paid for in dollars as well as Brazilian cruzados. People speak of traveling to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 4,000 miles north, as they do of a jaunt to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, 400 miles south. `` I worked like crazy in the worst jobs to make enough money to live without worry in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> now,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAmorim </PERSON>, 39, who said he spent 20 years living illegally in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before earning enough money to open a small restaurant in <LOCATION> Governador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valadares </LOCATION>. <PERSON> DeAmorim </PERSON> took 11 members of his family with him when in 1966 he moved to `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' as they call it here. He lived up and down the Northeast coast working as a bellboy in hotels, clearing tables in restaurants and assisting passengers on cruise ships. `` There's no way to earn money here,'' said <PERSON> Altair </PERSON> <PERSON> Silveira </PERSON>, 40, who first headed northward in 1967, to work illegally on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tourist visa, and who has returned regularly since being deported in 1969 to visit his son and daughter-in-law in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> you can save money to start a decent life, buy a house, a car, things you could never have on a Brazilian salary,'' he said. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> never has been a major source of illegal emigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But with inflation spiraling at a projected annual rate of 2,000 percent, unemployment at 25 percent and wages 40 percent lower in real terms than they were two years ago, more and more Brazilians have their eyes on `` America.'' `` The growing number of Brazilians living illegally in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a source of concern,'' said <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, head of the Consular Section at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. `` We must take firmer steps to reverse the trend before there is an explosion.'' <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest country, has a population of more than 143 million. Though precise figures on illegal aliens are hard to come by, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s Consulate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> estimates about 100,000 Brazilians live in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, half of them illegally. A similar number are thought to live in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and thousands more in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. According to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s federal police, 1.25 million citizens have emigrated legally over the past three years to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. But thousands more simply overstayed tourist visas or sneaked into foreign countries. Some have unpleasant memories of life in `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` No one likes living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Silveira </PERSON>, who was deported nearly 20 years ago. `` To the contrary, people live in such awful conditions to save money that they come back with bitter feelings.'' There is even a bimonthly newspaper for the homesick, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brasileira </ORGANIZATION>, which is printed in <LOCATION> Governador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valadares </LOCATION> and sent to some 10,000 Brazilians abroad. According to Mayor <PERSON> Perim </PERSON>, the city's economy depends on money earned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and sent home. Each month, people who have emigrated send an estimated $ 3 million to relatives at home, and often the money goes to pay installments on a new home. In <PERSON> Governador </PERSON> <PERSON> Valadares </PERSON>, new office and apartment buildings have risen between chic boutiques, jutting above the barren rural landscape. According to <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavares </PERSON>, who owns a construction company, 46 high rises are currently being built and more than half will be higher than 10 floors.

<HEAD>GOVERNADOR VASLADARES: 10 floors.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` It would be a financial disaster for the city if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> channel were closed off,'' <PERSON> Perim </PERSON> said. `` The city would literally collapse, without resources or jobs.'' The ties between <PERSON> Governador </PERSON> <PERSON> Valadares </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are almost as old as the city, which grew up in the late 1930s around its rich mineral deposits, principally mica. During World War II, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technicians established mica mines and built a railroad from <PERSON> Governador </PERSON> <PERSON> Valadares </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Vitoria </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast. After the war, mica dropped sharply in value. <PERSON> Governador </PERSON> <PERSON> Valadares </PERSON> turned to timber, but it soon ran out. In the late 1960s, with no new income sources in sight, some 20 residents, now called `` pioneers,'' turned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. During the 1970s, years of economic prosperity in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, plenty of jobs were available and emigration fell off. But it picked up again in the recession-plagued 1980s. In 1985 the federal police in <PERSON> Governador </PERSON> <PERSON> Valadares </PERSON> issued 1,747 passports, 2,408 in 1986, and 3,568 in 1987. That number is expected to double this year, a federal police source said. `` Here I earn about 50,000 cruzados -LRB- $ 100 -RRB- a month but I know that in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> I can earn at least seven times that amount,'' said taxi driver <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Reis </PERSON>. `` I'll do anything I must to get in.'' Last year the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> issued 70,000 tourist visas, refusing about 25 percent of applicants, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. This year the <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> expects to issue 95,000 visas with the same rejection rate, with an additional 20 percent probably to be turned away by immigration officials at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports. A shady market of false documents, visas and illegal trips has grown up around the exodus. In just one year, the number of travel agencies in <LOCATION> Governador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valadares </LOCATION> grew from four to 13. Most opened their doors with offerings of illegal, guided trips across the Mexican border at $ 3,000 a person. Despite the financial benefits for the city, many in <PERSON> Governador </PERSON> <PERSON> Valadares </PERSON> are concerned by the number of neighbors moving northward. A theater director, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambari </PERSON>, month filled a 500-seat theater for a month with his latest production, `` Last One to Leave Turn Out the Lights,'' a comic revue that tells of the tough life immigrants face in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Gradusen </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest, said he cautions in his weekly sermons against pursuit of what he calls the `` holy dollar.'' `` Often husbands go off leaving their wives behind, and when they return, the wives have taken up with someone else,'' <PERSON> Gradusen </PERSON> said. `` And most of those who make the trip sell everything they have to meet the costs. They often take out a loan that they ca n't always repay We want people to see that they risk their happiness in the name of making money.'' The economic crisis has spurred other Brazilians to think of leaving. An August opinion poll published by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Folha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> showed 62 percent of those in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, the country's largest city, would live abroad if they could

 On a recent Saturday, the Tagansky Gastronome had for sale: one fresh green vegetable, two kinds of fresh fruit, pig's heads and trotters and beef that was at least half fat and gristle. There was no veal, no lamb, no fresh fish, no other kinds of pork. Muscovites consider the Tagansky one of their city's finest supermarkets. Before 9 a.m., about 200 shoppers were lined up across the dirty concrete floor waiting to buy soft gray sausages that looked like knockwurst. Others snapped up bunches of onions, plastic sacks of apples and green, unripe Cuban grapefruit. A poster hanging by the bread counter read: `` Conserve bread _ it's the property of the people.'' In the eight aisles of the southeast <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> store, and others like it nationwide, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ambitious economic vision runs smack into gritty Soviet reality. In the fourth year of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s tenure, what people here euphemistically call `` the food question'' seems as acute as ever. x -RCB- Ptis program of economic reform depends in large part on his government's ability to improve the food supply and convince the public his program is worth the greater effort it demands. In a country that has experienced at least two disastrous famines in a lifetime, many if not most Soviets gauge <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for `` perestroika,'' or restructuring, by what it puts on their grocery shelves <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belov </PERSON>, deputy director of the state committee on statistics, told reporters recently that food supplies reaching Soviet stores are short by more than 1.3 billion rubles -LRB- $ 2 billion at the official exchange rate -RRB- of the annual need and the 1988 economic plan. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told a key <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting on agriculture that even factories in the Soviet defense complex have been put to work making farm implements with the goal of improving the nation's harvest, and consequently, its diet `` Life demands that the earth should produce, and that livestock units should produce, because that produce is greatly needed by our society,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the Oct. 12 meeting. To better feed Soviets, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, himself the son of a Russian peasant, has broken with 60 years of Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy to call for the leasing of arable land around the nation to individual farmers. For Americans accustomed to year-round abundance, freshness and a choice of supermarkets, the food situation in the other superpower is frankly bleak. At the delivery end of the food chain, in stores like the Tagansky Gastronome, what the Russians call `` deficits'' _ chronic shortages _ are wide-ranging and frequent. `` It is humiliating that we still are n't able to feed ourselves, buying even bread, and oil, and meat, and fruits, and vegetables abroad,'' the poet <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON> lamented in a much-discussed essay published this year. `` The rationing system that we have in many regions is our shame.'' After 70 years of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> power, some food items regarded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as staples are rationed in eight of this country's 15 constituent republics. According to recent reports in the state-run media: _ Food shortages are so acute in parts of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Federation </LOCATION> that meat is rationed in 26 regions, butter in 32, and sugar in 53 Some regions cover more territory some individual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states. _ In the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountain city of <LOCATION> Berezniki </LOCATION>, meat is so scarce that residents can buy only 300 to 400 grams of sausage a month, the equivalent of five or six good-sized hot dogs _ Food is so short in <LOCATION> Ryazan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> cities that their residents stream into <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and each year carry off a half-million tons of meat and meat products alone A joke goes: What is long, green and smells like sausage? Answer: The Moscow-to-Tula train. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is no land of freeze-dried, vacuum-packed, microwavable, one-stop food shopping either. For many, finding something good for the dinner table is an ordeal and challenge that can mean hours of being jostled in line, dealing with surly shop clerks, and frustration over long-term `` deficits.'' `` You get mad at city officials every time you go shopping after working hours or try to get a bite to eat downtown,'' the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> groused in a recent criticism of the capital's state-run stores and restaurants Many Soviets have alternate food sources. One <LOCATION> Yaroslavl </LOCATION> factory runs its own pig farm and greenhouses to supply employees with pork and cucumbers. Peasants with private plots can sell their produce in special markets for more than the price fixed in state stores. Outside the Tagansky, a man with a moustache hawks persimmons from the southern republic of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>. He belongs to a cooperative, one of the free associations of producers and vendors that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is counting on to relieve the country's consumer shortages. Perks for top party and government officials include food parcels and access to a special network of shops selling meat, sturgeon, caviar and other hard-to-find items. Bureaucrats' black Volga sedans regularly pull up to the rear door of the Tagansky, and drivers enter to fetch cardboard boxes crammed with delicacies. Not all news from the farm is bleak. <PERSON> Belov </PERSON> said overall agricultural output increased 4 percent in the past nine months compared to the same period in 1987. There will be less grain and fewer potatoes than last year, but more corn, he said. But as <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, the late premier, once said, `` You ca n't make pancakes out of statistics.'' An American food processing expert who visited Soviet packaging plants this summer estimated that one potato in two never makes from farm to market because it is ruined or rots in transit and storage. By improving the way crops are harvested, transported, stored, processed and delivered to consumers, the country could increase production on some foodstuffs by as much as 40 percent, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the meeting on agriculture. Until this is done, however, `` deficits'' will remain an exasperating part of Soviet life. On a recent train trip, a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> reporter offered a cup of Western-made instant coffee to a traveling companion, a professional violinist from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The man tasted the coffee, sighed, and said: `` You know, our Soviet instant coffee is better. But there is n't any of it.''

 Before clocking in at her job in central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> one recent morning, <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON> was already working to find the makings of that night's dinner for herself and her husband. By the time she finished, she had spent two hours 17 minutes in lines, taken a side trip on a streetcar, and paid a total of 14 rubles -LRB- $ 22.80 -RRB-. Although Ms. <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON> earns more than the average industrial worker's salary of 200 rubles -LRB- $ 322 -RRB- a month, the meal turned out to be an expensive one not only in money but also in time. In the morning, Ms. <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON> stood in line for 20 minutes at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> supermarket to buy two frozen chickens. The scrawny looking fowl, sold in plastic bags, cost 4.72 rubles -LRB- $ 7.69 -RRB-, or $ 1.30 a pound, heads and feet included. Mrs. <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON> was late to work because of the delay. She worked until 6 p.m., and then took the subway to <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prospekt </ORGANIZATION> in the city's southwest. At a butcher's shop, Mrs. <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON> waited in line for 43 minutes to buy beef for the beet soup, or borscht, she had decided to prepare. The meat, enough for generous helpings for two people, cost her 3.75 rubles -LRB- $ 6.11 -RRB-. She then hopped on a streetcar and rode for 15 minutes to a vegetable store. Once more she stood in line, this time for 37 minutes, and bought beets, cabbage, potatoes and some grapes for dessert. Cost: 3.43 rubles -LRB- $ 5.59 -RRB-. One ingredient was still missing for the borscht _ sour cream. Lugging her purchases, Mrs. <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON> walked to a milk shop, where she waited 22 minutes to buy an enormous dollop of the cream the Russians call `` smetana.'' It cost 1.70 rubles -LRB- $ 2.77 -RRB-. There was one final stop for Mrs. <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON> _ the bakery. She stood in line there for 15 minutes to buy two loaves of bread for 40 kopecks -LRB- 65 cents -RRB-. When Mrs. <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON> returned home to her one-room apartment, it was 8:30 p.m. By the time she and her husband sat down to a dinner of borscht, fried chicken, mashed potatoes and grapes, it was 11:30 p.m. According to Mrs. <PERSON> Ivanova </PERSON>, it was an all-too-typical day.

 At this 25th anniversary of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination, it's fair to ask, `` What if he had lived?

 Mesmerized by the commanding view of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from a hill atop <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> remarked in 1963 that he could stay there forever. Later that year, an assassin would strike him down, and he would be buried near the site he admired so. In a city filled with monuments and memorials, the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> grave site, striking in its simplicity, remains to many the nation's most emotional symbol of life and death, of hope and lost dreams, even 25 years after his violent death. `` <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s grave brings out a lot of emotions in people,'' said <PERSON> Kerri </PERSON> <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>, the cemetery's historian who was a second-grader when the president was gunned down in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Nov. 22, 1963. `` A lot of memories come back. People do n't just remember <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination. They remember that whole period of their lives, their families, their friends. People tell me they remember smells, sounds.'' Adults weep openly at the grave. Admirers silently leave flowers on the granite bed. A blind woman, after visiting the cemetery dozens of times, cried when she `` saw'' it for the first time as she was allowed to run her fingers over the stones and feel the heat from the eternal flame. There's another eternal flame. It burns warmly in the memories of those who knew and served with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, friends and advisers who can visualize him still alive, still keeping a hand in the direction of his nation. `` Without question, he would have continued to be an extremely active, public-spirited, heavily involved person in all matters that would have to do with social progress and world peace,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, who served as the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s liaison to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He recalls the late president occasionally referring to life after the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ he would have been only 51 if he'd served the maximum eight years _ and the talk revolved around academic life, perhaps at his alma mater, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Instead, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> renamed its government school in <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>'s honor as a `` living memorial'' to the 35th president <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s closest confidants from his first campaign for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to that tragic November day, envisioned a post-presidential <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as a roving ambassador of sorts. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> used to wonder why former presidents `` were n't put to better use,'' according to Powers, who served as a special assistant to JFK. `` I think <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have gone to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or wherever was necessary.'' <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> recalls a delegation of Soviet generals visiting JFK's grave In minute detail, they told where they were and what they were doing when they heard the news that the president, who had confronted their own leader over <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> but later joined <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khruschev </PERSON> in a nuclear Test Ban Treaty, was dead. Like many Americans, they wondered what might have been. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> and Powers doubt <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have run for political office after serving two presidential terms, but others wonder. `` It's just possible he might have stayed in politics, going back to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON>, who served as <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s secretary of state Author and former <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> agrees, saying that the late president would have followed the example of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The sixth president was the only one to return to a lower public office after serving in the White House. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> served in the House for 18 years after his single term as president. `` He would have run for office and would have stood for a continuing voice on national affairs, and would now be the senior senator from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s youngest brother, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, is the state's senior senator. `` He talked about two things: a Kennedy library and writing, but that was n't his life,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said, suggesting such academic pursuits were too sedentary for a man of action. <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s national security adviser during such tumultuous times as the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban missile crisis, took the idea of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> holding public office after the presidency a step further. `` He'd probably agree with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on exactly one subject: that the 22nd Amendment is a nuisance,'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said, referring to the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms. `` I think by now he'd be ready to try again. `` If they had repealed the 22nd Amendment, let's say five years ago, this -LRB- election -RRB- might be <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' he said. `` It would be quite an encounter.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have been six years younger than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. If JFK had lived, <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> thinks he would still be revered, but the Kennedy years would not have taken on mythic proportions. `` He would not have given any thought to the idea of Camelot,'' <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> said. `` His time in office was a serious time. There was nothing ` Camelot' about it. His life was filled with serious crises.'' Though it's difficult to guess how a living <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would be viewed by Americans today, his grave tells something. An estimated 4 million visitors each year walk up the steps to a large, elliptical plaza surrounded by a short granite wall that contains quotations from <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>'s 1961 inaugural address. To the northeast, through a valley of trees, is a clear view of the Lincoln Memorial across the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, linking <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to another martyred president. To the southwest and up a grassy hill is the Custis-Lee Mansion, the one-time home of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and the place where <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> made his remarks about the beauty of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> shortly before his death. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s grave lies near his brother's. Up another short set of steps is a rectangular terrace that includes the JFK grave site, an 18-by-30-foot area. The focal point is the eternal flame, lit during the interment ceremony by his widow, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>. How many of the grave's visitors silently echo JFK aide Powers? `` What might have been,'' he said, `` we'll never know.''

 Americans rank <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as the nation's greatest president, remembering him with a striking sense of loss a quarter-century after his assassination, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found But <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s exalted place in history rests more on his potential and his personal qualities than on his accomplishments in office. In the national survey he was rated far higher on charisma than on other attributes. Slightly more than one-fifth of the 1,125 adults surveyed picked <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as the greatest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president, more than named any other. Only <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> came close in popularity. Among all respondents, a plurality rated <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as a good president, not a great one. Still, a majority said they believed that had he lived and served a second term, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be a better place today. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, at 43 the youngest president elected, served nearly three years before he was shot and killed in a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> motorcade Nov. 22, 1963. Twenty-five years later, his name is invoked and his words are quoted by politicians seeking to assume his mantle of popularity. In more recent years, the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> image crumbled a bit with reports of extramarital affairs and of meetings with a Mafia boss. In the survey, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s judgment was rated lower than other qualities. Most striking, however, was the depth of feeling associated with the slain president. More than six in 10 respondents said they still felt a personal loss from <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>'s assassination, including many who were children or were not yet born in 1963. Among his contemporaries, seven in 10 feel a loss. In another gauge, the poll asked if respondents remembered where they were when they heard <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had been killed. Of those 30 and older now _ meaning they were at least 5 years old then _ more than 90 percent said yes. To order the pantheon of presidents, the survey asked: `` Who do you think was the greatest American president?'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was named by 21 percent; <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, 17 percent each; <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 7 percent each. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has led similar lists in other polls over the years. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was most popular with 30 - to 44-year-olds, who were children or teen-agers when he served; nearly a third of them called him the greatest president In other ratings as well, that group viewed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> especially favorably. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who moved to enforce civil rights laws in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, also was rated particularly highly by blacks. Eight in 10 felt a personal loss from his death, and 60 percent of blacks called him a great president, compared to 31 percent of whites. Overall, a third of respondents said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a great president and 40 percent said a good one. He did better with Democrats and the less-educated, and as the first Roman Catholic president, he was rated highly by <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> also was more popular with liberals, but his standing to a great degree transcended ideology. He achieved his high ratings even though 40 percent identified him as a liberal, while only 15 percent identified themselves as liberals. To gauge the components of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s image, the poll took measures _ excellent, good, fair or poor _ of his accomplishments as president, his potential for accomplishments had he not been assassinated, and his leadership, judgment and charisma. Although he was rated highly in all categories, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> drew far and away the best ratings for his charisma _ 60 percent excellent. Next were his leadership and his potential, both rated excellent by 39 percent. But <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s excellent ratings fell off on his accomplishments and his judgment: In both, about two in 10 said excellent. Half said good, but in his only sizable negative scores, more than a fifth rated him just fair in both categories. There was a partisan aspect to many of the ratings. Fifty-two percent overall said the nation would be a better place had <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> lived and served a second term; that included 68 percent of the Democrats polled, compared to 34 percent of the Republicans. Doubts emerged on the specific issue of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. About a third said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have prevented the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from becoming deeply involved in the fighting there, but 44 percent said not. The rest did n't know. The survey found considerable familiarity with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>; more than half the respondents 30 and over said they knew a great deal about him. But such awareness waned among younger adults: Of those 18-29, only 25 percent shared that sense of familiarity with the former president. The poll, conducted Sept. 6-14, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 Oh, how the world has changed in 25 years. Then, <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>'s bragged `` Over a Billion Hamburgers Sold from Coast to Coast,'' now it's simply `` billions and billions.'' The Chrysler Theater was on the air, the <ORGANIZATION> Weavers </ORGANIZATION> were on their farewell performance tour, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> and his American <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were peddling hate. In those days of the quickening civil rights movement, blacks still were referred to in newspapers as Negroes. In 1963, `` superb men's suits'' sold in the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> clothing chain for $ 39.95, sirloin strip steaks went for $ 1.39 a pound, a quart of <ORGANIZATION> Dewar </ORGANIZATION>'s White Label was $ 6.39. Snow tires on sale were $ 10.22, wheel balancing and mounting free. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Palooka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and The <ORGANIZATION> Pirates </ORGANIZATION> were in the funnies and so was Pogo. Condoms were sold in gas station restroom vending machines or from under the counter in drug stores. Boys still blushed when they asked for them. Tempus fugit. Time flies. It stood still that day in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was killed. But the world that he knew _ and that knew him _ is a different world today. Then, it cost $ 950 to send a kid to a state college, $ 1,907 to a private school _ room, board and tuition. Now those figures are $ 4,445 and $ 11,330. <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s day is <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. Southern <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' 113 member states have grown to 159, the world's population from 3.2 billion to more than 5 billion, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s from 189 million to 244 million. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, then an outcast, a technological pygmy, now bids to launch American satellites. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which rattled the nuclear saber and blustered `` we will bury you'' in <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>'s time, is working with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reduce the number of horrible weapons. At the time of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s Cuban missile crisis, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had 5,000 nuclear weapons, the Soviets only 300. Now each country has over 25,000. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> revived Depression-era food stamps as a pilot program; now 19 million people use them. The number of farms in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has fallen by more than 1 million, to fewer than 2.2 million. Baseball's major leagues crossed the border to embrace <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> got into the majors and so have <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, halfway between <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, home of <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>. The nation's game, however, is no longer played professionally in the nation's If you were shopping for early Christmas presents in 1963 you could choose from wood tennis rackets, home movie projectors, portable typewriters, most of which can still be gotten but who needs them in the days of graphite rackets, camcorders and laptop computers? You could n't buy a telephone then; you can now. When people talked about using `` calculators,'' they meant slide rules or adding machines. You could take the SS <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, buy a <ORGANIZATION> VW </ORGANIZATION> bug, which everyone thought would be around forever. Cars from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>? Do n't be silly. In 1963, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON> became the second golfer ever to make $ 100,000 _ <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, of course, was the first.

More than 58,000 young Americans lost their lives.

The deficit built into in <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1989 proposal _ $ 129.5 billion _ is more than the entire <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> budget. The debt ceiling was $ 315 billion. It is now _ hold your breath _ $ 2.8 trillion. That's 2,800 billion dollars.

JFK's son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who saluted bravely as his father's coffin passed, is a strapping, handsome 28-year-old. In 1963, 77 percent of American homes had television sets; 98 percent do today. And three out of four homes had telephones; now 93 out of 100 homes have them. More than half of all homes have video cassette recorders, which were virtually unknown then. Radios have multiplied: 156 million in 1963 and 530 million now. There is no change in older folks' complaints about the younger generation's taste in music <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had committed the nation to going to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> in the decade of the'60s, and it did, but when he died only six Americans had gone into space. Since then, 12 Americans have walked on the moon and, in all, 208 astronauts have been aboard 57 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space flights. The Soviets have sent 138 cosmonauts on 65 flights. They have female astronauts, and so have we. In 1963, there was no transplanting of hearts, but there was cocky confidence that virtually any infection could be controlled with antibiotics and chemicals. That was before toxic shock syndrome, <ORGANIZATION> Legionnaire </ORGANIZATION>'s disease and now, the dread AIDS. Tempus fugit. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s beautiful young wife is a grandmother. The world has changed. The torch, as he said, has passed.

 In fairy tales, the beautiful princess marries the handsome prince and they live happily ever after. But <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouvier </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' fairy tale short-circuited on a warm day in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> when her pink suit was splattered with her prince's blood. In the ensuing 25 years, she has had to write her own happy ending. The plot twists she has chosen have not been popular with the adoring multitudes who would have preferred that she remain the national widow. Her 1968 marriage to Greek shipping tycoon <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> engendered outrage, and her penchant for privacy has bred some resentment. But once a year, she kneels alone at Arlington National Cemetery. And once again she becomes the stoic, black-veiled widow who stood at that spot in November 1963 to bury her husband, President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` One must not let oneself be overwhelmed by sadness,'' she once said.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 It is important to remember what <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and to the world. She was the glamorous, whispery-voiced brunette whose appearances caused as much commotion as her husband's _ so much so that he laughingly introduced himself as <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>'s escort. She was the fashion plate whose designer dresses, pillbox hats and white gloves spurred the fashion industry as much as her hatless husband wounded the fedora trade. `` We are on the threshold of a new American elegance thanks to Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s beauty, naturalness, understatement, exposure and symbolism,'' said <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassini </PERSON>, her official designer. She was the young hostess of a televised tour of the White House, the graduate of Miss <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s School and <ORGANIZATION> Vassar </ORGANIZATION> who said her prime responsibility was to `` take care of the president so he can best serve the people.'' She was 34 years old when <PERSON> JFK </PERSON> died, a striking contrast to her matronly predecessors, <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. Most of all, she was mistress of Camelot.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 She forfeited that title when she married <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, the aging Greek who seemed the antithesis of the elegant <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Many said she was a golddigger; she never explained the marriage publicly, never responded to such headlines as `` Jackie: How Could You?'' `` She, by surviving and being with him -LRB- JFK -RRB- when he died so dramatically, became a legend in her own lifetime,'' said a friend, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON>. `` And she can not live up to it because no human being could.'' The marriage foundered quickly, and <PERSON> Ari </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> lived separate lives. When he died in 1975, he left her $ 120,000 in his will; she won a $ 26 million settlement from the <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> family. At the same time, stories about JFK's escapades while he was president began to spread _ stories about alleged liaisons with <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> and the mistress of mobster <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Giancana </PERSON>. And others suggested that JFK's most lasting legacy was the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Camelot was n't what it used to be.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 With her millions, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> could have done absolutely nothing, enjoying her 14-room apartment on upper Fifth Avenue, her estate in <LOCATION> Bernardsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and the oceanfront compound on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard while raising her two children, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Instead, she entered the job force in 1978 as an editor for <ORGANIZATION> Doubleday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. She works there 3 -LCB- days a week _ producing ideas and acquiring books from authors and agents, then guiding the writing of manuscripts Her primary publishing interests are art and entertainment, never politics. Her bestsellers have included <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s autobiography, `` Moonwalk,'' and ballerina <PERSON> Gelsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>'s `` Dancing on My Grave `` I think people who work themselves have respect for the work of others,'' she has said. Her salary, reportedly $ 40,000-50 ,000 a year, is a pittance of her net worth _ estimated at around $ 50 million, plus $ 200,000 a year from a trust fund bequeathed by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> She has made some public appearances in recent years. She has supported efforts to save city landmarks like Grand Central Terminal, attending news conferences but saying little and slipping out through freight entrances. On her infrequent appearances at social galas, she often dons the designs of <PERSON> Carolina </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>. Her date is usually longtime friend <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON>, 58, a Belgian-born diamond dealer and international businessman. On autumn weekends, Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> sometimes rides with the <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, near her <LOCATION> Bernardsville </LOCATION> estate. She often is among the spectators at the annual steeplechase in nearby <LOCATION> Peapack </LOCATION>; she does not mingle with the locals. She has been seen sailing and waterskiing off <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard with <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON>, but often eludes the public eye camouflaged in a scarf and sunglasses. Her island house is at the end of a 2,000-foot driveway. The signs out front say `` No Trespassing.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' battles with paparazzi are legendary. She repeatedly went to court to thwart the attentions of photographer <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Galella </PERSON>, first obtaining a court order barring <PERSON> Galella </PERSON> from coming within 30 feet of her or her children, then going to court to enforce that order. She declines all interviews, according to her spokeswoman, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckerman </PERSON>. She would not speak on the 20th anniversary of the assassination; she will not speak on the quarter-century anniversary. But occasionally, New Yorkers catch glimpses. One newspaper recently showed <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, a still youthful-looking grandmother, crossing a street while engrossed in a book, oblivious to the photographer. Even celebrity-immune New Yorkers stare when they spot her jogging in Central Park or shopping on Madison Avenue. `` You have two compartments. Your private and your public life,'' she once explained. `` I think I'm more of a private person. I do n't really like to call attention to anything.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Twenty-five years after the assassination, after <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>'s fall from grace with a Greek, after revelations about the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> era and after her determined efforts to maintain her privacy, a poll asked Americans to list their most admired first ladies. First was <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, the most active of all president's wives Second was <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whose anti-drug campaign was the stuff of current headlines. And third was <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouvier </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> took the podium at the Democratic National Convention in July, the national memory drifted back nearly 25 years, to the mind's image of a 3-year-old boy saluting his father's horse-drawn caisson. But this was no `` John-John'' on the stage in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. This was a darkly handsome, well-spoken law student who would soon be declared <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s sexiest man by a national magazine; this was a 28-year-old millionaire who had traveled the world and worked with the poor. More than a quarter-century has passed since <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his sister, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>, now 30, charmed the nation with their Oval Office shenanigans. They endured the assassinations of their father in 1963 and their Uncle <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> in 1968. They adjusted when their mother married Greek shipping magnate <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> in 1968. Still, by all reports <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> thrived _ they did well in private schools, became proficient in sports, made lasting friendships and avoided the drugs that so twisted the lives of some of their cousins. Like their mother, both <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> children guard their privacy and decline all interview requests, said family spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckerman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> earned a fine arts degree at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, then served as manager and coordinating producer of the office of film and television at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She abandoned a career in photojournalism because other people aimed cameras at her every time she tried to take pictures. She married author-artist <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlossberg </PERSON> in July 1986. After a $ 1,250-a-week internship in 1987 as a summer associate at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm, she graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law school in May. She gave birth to a daughter, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlossberg </PERSON>, on June 25. Her brother has kept a more public profile. Now an athletic 6-foot-1, with matinee-idol good looks, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> recently was named by <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> as `` the sexiest man alive.'' Like his father, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has been described as extremely shy, although he did make a few campaign speeches when his cousin, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, ran for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> acted in two productions at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, where he graduated in 1982. In the summer of 1985, he starred in a revival of a play called `` Winners,'' staged and directed by his fellow <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> graduates at the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. His co-star was <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Haag </PERSON>, an actress and his steady girlfriend of the past two years. They have known each other since they were both 15. There have been no theatrical experiences since. `` Acting is just a hobby,'' he once told a reporter. While an undergraduate, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> spent a summer traveling in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON>, his mother's friend, has mining and manufacturing interests. Another summer he worked as a <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteer in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. Later, he spent six months working with the poor in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. In 1984, he began his first job, in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Office of Business Development. He also spent one summer as a $ 1,100-a-week intern at a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> law firm. The young <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who lives in a modest apartment in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, is a millionaire, thanks to a trust fund left by his father and the settlement his mother made with the <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> estate. Although he has no personal recollection of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> days _ he was only 3 when his father was killed _ he majored in American history in college, has studied his father's administration and is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Despite speculation about a possible political future, he has steadfastly denied having any definite career plans beyond <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where he is completing his final year.

<TEXT>
 Television viewers are being offered basically two ways of marking the 25th anniversary of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination _ as nostalgia or as unsolved mystery. The most compelling special is most likely to be the <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s uninterrupted six hours of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> news coverage of the assassination as it appeared on the network 25 years ago. The special even begins on the dot at 1:56 p.m. EST on Nov. 22 by breaking into regular programming. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> will offer highlights of its coverage, too, in a two-hour special on Nov. 17. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> plan commemorative documentaries more about <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s life than his death. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s documentary also examines what the country was like in the early'60s. Investigative reporter <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> puts forth his conspiracy theory in a syndicated special _ he says <ORGANIZATION> JFK </ORGANIZATION> was murdered by hit men. <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> is host of a replay of the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> production that put <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> `` on trial,'' with a real judge, lawyers and witnesses. Here are some of the TV specials on <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the assassination, in order of their airing: Nov. 2: <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s live, two-hour, syndicated special in which he states flatly that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was assassinated by `` underworld hit men with connections to the Third World.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> also asserts the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> knew and hid the truth. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who bases his conclusions on interviews with an underworld figure now deceased, says he'll interview former president <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, the last surviving member of the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Marita </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON>, described as <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s mistress, and former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operatives <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> and <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. Nov. 6: <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> premiere of its special, `` JFK: In His Own Words,'' featuring never-before-seen film footage and rare audio tapes in which <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> talks about his childhood, his political career and his presidency. It has additional playdates on Nov. 9, 14, 19, 22 and 25. Nov. 6: The <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> presents the first part of `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>: A Celebration of His Life and Times.'' The series, created in cooperation with the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family, is divided into three sections, the first from <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s birth through his election to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Part two, airing Nov. 13, is called `` The Race for the White House.'' Part three, on Nov. 20, is `` The Presidency and the Legacy.'' Nov. 15: PBS' `` NOVA'' science series takes a scholarly look at the question `` Who Shot President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>?'' Documentary filmmaker <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> put the theories of conspiracy buffs to present-day scientific tests. For instance, he says, updated photo enhancement techniques get a clearer image from a controversial Polaroid picture taken by a bystander that supposedly showed a gunman on the grassy knoll near the motorcade route. The picture was previously considered too blurry to be conclusive. Nov. 17: CBS' two-hour special, gleaned from its own 53 hours of coverage of the assassination, includes the bulletin that interrupted `` As the World Turns'' at 1:40 p.m. when then-CBS anchor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> first reported the shooting; the first live reports from the scene; <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>'s exclusive report that the president had died; <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reasoner </PERSON>'s tribute to <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>; the arrest and subsequent shooting of <LOCATION> Oswald </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s funeral. Nov. 21: <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` JFK _ A Time Remembered'' intersperses archival footage with present-day reminiscences by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> associates, reporters and others. Those interviewed include <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> aides <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON>; reporters <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sander </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanocur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wicker </PERSON>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Felder </PERSON>, a bearer of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s casket in the funeral procession. Nov. 22: <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` JFK Assassination: As It Happened,'' a rebroadcast of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s coverage of the assassination. A & amp; E is running the six-hour special without commercials. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> team covering the assassination, is the host. Viewers who do n't have six hours can tune in at 6:30 p.m. for a 90-minute wrap-up. The special will be repeated on Saturday, Nov. 26, beginning at 10:56 a.m. Nov. 22: <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> is host of `` On Trial: <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>.'' This is the five-hour mock trial that aired in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and on Showtime cable in November 1986. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lucius </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> presided and attorneys <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Bugliosi </PERSON>, who prosecuted the <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> family, and <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, who litigated the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Silkwood </PERSON> case, cross-examined actual witnesses. A jury, selected from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> residents, found <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> guilty in 1986. This time, viewers can call a 900 number and register their opinions. Nov. 22: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s one-hour special, `` A November Journey: Kennedy Remembered,'' anchored by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, a retrospective on <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his time through archival footage and interviews.

A decade has passed since the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assassinations </ORGANIZATION> ended its work by concluding that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and King were apparently the victims of conspiracies, but the committee documents, which scholars say would be important research tools, appear no closer to being opened to the public. `` What we're talking about is the records of our political history _ two of the most important events of the 20th century,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a former committee aide who has led a small group of private Kennedy researchers in the fight to open the records. `` This is about the public's right to know.'' Most of the work conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which concluded that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> acted alone in the <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> slaying, has been opened to the public, a move that has helped researchers evaluate _ and in many cases strongly criticize _ that investigation. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee, the only government investigation to conclude that conspiracies were involved in either murder, ran out of money and was dissolved before voting to release its documents. Without such a vote, the materials fell under the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s so-called `` 50-year rule,'' keeping congressional documents under lock and key for a half-century The late Rep. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., a member of the select committee, had taken up the scholars' cause in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, fighting for a resolution to release most of the documents But he died in 1987. Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, the committee chairman, originally led opposition to that resolution, but had a change of heart after <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>'s death, from AIDS, and said he would work for the information's release. That buoyed researchers, but the 1988 legislative session came and went without any action on the committee documents. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> to act next year on a measure that would immediately open some of the records, but he declined to provide specifics. The committee sent shockwaves around the world in December 1978 when it concluded that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s killing in 1963 was probably the result of a conspiracy _ pointing to accoustic evidence that experts said clearly showed the presence of a second gunman. The committee also concluded that a conspiracy likely was behind the King slaying in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> five years later. But in 1982, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> concluded that there was no evidence of a second <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> gunman and that the independent experts used by the committee incorrectly analyzed a tape recording made from a motorcycle policeman's open microphone. The experts' testimony had been the key to the committee's conclusion; before it, the panel had planned to conclude that there was no conspiracy Despite the academy study and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s final conclusion this year that there was no conspiracy in either slaying, <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> stands by his committee's report. `` It's a difference between scientists,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said.

 After 25 years, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> finally has matched courage with cash and will open the sixth floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depository </ORGANIZATION> to the world. Over the decades, the old warehouse has survived arsonists and calls for demolition. For a time, all buyers shunned it. All this ill will because of a new young order clerk named <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, who, perched at a corner window on boxes of `` Rolling Readers,'' apparently fired two, maybe three, rifle shots at a motorcade passing below. Now workers are just a month away from topping off an outside elevator that will carry up to half-a-million visitors a year to the infamous sixth floor, where they can view an exhibit on President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and look out that corner window down to <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>. It's a $ 3.5 million project 12 years in the making _ one that <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, for a long time, never wanted for fear of drawing more attention to a tragedy that heaped shame on the city. `` What we are doing is facing up to our history,'' said <PERSON> Lindalyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, who has made the exhibit a decade-long personal crusade. `` The old saying is, ` Time heals all wounds,''' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the chief of the county commissioners who made completion of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> exhibit a priority in his 1987 inauguration speech. `` It's not unusual that sites of tragedy in history only recover over some period of time, like <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, or the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, or Yorktown,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` It's taken <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> 25 years to reach this consensus.'' Every day of the year, virtually around the clock, a steady trickle of tourists and tour buses makes the pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> and the grassy knoll. They find monuments but then learn they honor the city's founders. They see a 10-sentence plaque on the side of the book depository. The nine sentences noting the spot where <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> was settled are followed by this: `` On Nov. 22, 1963, the building gained national notoriety when <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> allegedly shot and killed President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> from a sixth floor window as the presidential motorcade passed the site.'' And then they invariably count six floors up. Next Feb. 20, on President's Day, `` The Sixth Floor Exhibit'' will open to the public. More than $ 1 million has been raised privately, with $ 300,000 to go. The fundraising effort took years, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said, and did n't really pick up until <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made it a county priority `` It's easy to misunderstand what we're doing,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` There is a feeling among many of us who were living in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> at the time that we'd just as soon not be reminded.'' To permit construction to begin, the county advanced $ 2.2 million, which will be repaid through the $ 4 admission charge. The exhibit will be a maze of historical panels tied together with videos and movies produced by acclaimed filmmaker <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurow </PERSON> -LRB- `` Terms of Endearment,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Waltz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Across </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` Breakfast at <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION>'s'' -RRB-. `` It's far more than an assassination museum,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` It's about the life of President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and his death. It's about the'60s and what <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> was like It puts everything in the context of American cultural history.'' The non-profit exhibit will have few actual artifacts _ no rifle, for example, only an original of the black-bordered anti-Kennedy ad, headlined `` Welcome to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>,'' that appeared in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that day, along with a reporter's notes and an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> teletype machine. There will be 400 photographs, many taken by the 22 people who were photographing the motorcade when the shots were fired. The corner window will be sealed by glass panels, although the actual green-painted window frame was removed by a previous owner. The spots where <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s rifle, three spent cartridges and palm prints were found will be recreated, based on police photos. The building, like <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>, is remarkably unchanged from Nov. 22, 1963. The school book brokerage kept its lease in the building for eight years after the assassination. A <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, promoter bought it but failed to raise enough money to convert it into a Kennedy Museum. Ownership reverted to the previous owner, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> oil and real estate mogul <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, who then could not sell the building. Calls for its demolition were turned back because the city refused to issue a demolition permit. In 1977, voters approved a bond package that included $ 400,000 to purchase the warehouse and convert it _ except for the sixth floor _ into county office space. It is now the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Administration Building. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s second-floor office looks out on the spot where <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was shot `` No one can visit this building regularly and fail to be struck by the number of curious visitors,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` And everyone who works here is aware they're located in a place of unusual public interest.'' Over time, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> realized the world probably would never stop coming to <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>. `` Over time, people finally felt they were able to put the experience behind them and they felt like the world was no longer viewing them as a community somehow responsible for the assassination,'' he said. `` Over time, the community has seen that the interest of the world is permanent and enduring.''

 `` Where were you, and what was your reaction when you heard that President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had been shot?'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovich </PERSON>, who was 8 years old when he overheard the school principal whisper news of the shooting to his teacher, recently put that question to 250 celebrities and assembled their responses into a book, `` Reflections on <ORGANIZATION> JFK </ORGANIZATION>'s Assassination,'' published by <ORGANIZATION> Woodbine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, recalled being near the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chambers and realizing that Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., was the presiding officer `` I immediately dispatched a page to tell Senator <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to leave the rostrum for a matter of utmost emergency. It was then that Senator <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> learned of his brother's shooting.'' Singer <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> said he first tried to console an eighth-grade classmate who was crying. He later took a long walk, feeling `` a deep bitterness and a despair I had never before experienced in my life.'' <PERSON> Rona </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> columnist, remembers being `` at a famous <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> racquet club. People came running out of the clubhouse screaming that someone had shot <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said the assassination `` proved to me that we have a lot more subversive activists in our country than we realize.'' Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he had walked into his warehouse to weigh a load of grain when a group of farmers told him of the shooting. He said he prayed, and `` wept openly for the first time in 10 years _ for the first time since the day my own father died.'' Novelist <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON> said all he could think about was `` that I did n't want <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. But I got him.'' <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacharach </PERSON> said he was working on a song with <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> when he found out about the shooting. He said he left the building and went to a bar, where he eventually got `` into a fight with some people who were having a good time laughing, etc., totally disrespectful of the moment.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``The Accused''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Rape has been treated frequently in television movies and in such films as `` Extremities,'' which featured a remarkable performance by <PERSON> Farrah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawcett </PERSON>. What more can be done with this vital but overworked subject? Producers <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, who struck gold with `` Fatal Attraction,'' have fictionalized a headlined gang rape and added a degree of cinematic hype. The result is `` The Accused,'' which has one scene of pure shock and a riveting performance by <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>. The screenplay by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Topor </PERSON> is obviously inspired by the 1983 case of a poolroom-table gang rape in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` The Accused'' begins with the half-clad, battered Foster escaping from a roadhouse, where a college student calls police to report the ordeal that she has suffered. What actually happened in the bar and the game room that night? Was the young woman brutalized by the boozing men without provocation? Or was she responsible for inciting them by her dress and banter? That is the mystery of the film, and it is not solved until the final minutes. The victim, <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, falls into the hands of an assistant prosecutor, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON>, who conducts a plea bargain with attorneys for the accused rapists. Without consulting Foster, <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON> allows the defendants to plead guilty to a lesser charge, the equivalent of a judicial rap on the knuckles. Foster is understandably furious that her right to vindication had been traded away without her knowledge. Only when she makes a scene at <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON>' dinner party does the attorney agree to defy her male superiors and reopen the case. It seems hopeless until she locates a convenient law and the key witness. <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> is sensational, invading the skin of the foul-talking waitress who seems to antagonize everyone who tries to help her. What prevents `` The Accused'' from being an all-absorbing film is the character of <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON> and the subdued manner with which she plays it. Perhaps it is in the writing or the direction of <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, or maybe she is merely overshadowed by a remarkable performance. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> builds up the suspense to the climactic retelling of the rape, and it is indeed a horrific sequence. The producers say it lasts only three minutes. It seems like a punishing half-hour. The Paramount release is rated R, with good reason because of language, nudity and sexual content. Running time: 110 minutes.

 A glistening, half-naked muscleman strikes a huge gong to signal the beginning of some of cinema's most cherished products _ the movies from the <ORGANIZATION> Rank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. From the 1940s through'60s, Rank films dominated British filmmaking with such gems as `` Great Expectations,'' `` Blythe Spirit'' and `` Brief Encounter.'' The company made stars out of <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogarde </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>. Rank stopped making feature movies in 1980. But its treasure trove of delightful comedies, melodramas and historical epics is available for the home screen from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, including `` Doctor in the House'' -LRB- 1954 -RRB-, `` The Captain's Table'' -LRB- 1958 -RRB- and `` Carry on Doctor'' -LRB- 1968 -RRB-, which is part of the outrageous `` Carry On'' series. The videos all retail for $ 19.95 and are unrated. `` Doctor in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' starring Bogarde, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> More </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> <PERSON> Justice </PERSON>, tracks the misadventures of four overage medical school students at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Swithin </LOCATION>'s Hospital. One is determined to flunk out so he can continue collecting an allowance from his wealthy aunt; another wants only to play rugby; a third is a womanizer; the fourth just might make a good doctor. The movie inspired a TV series and several sequels. Elsewhere in video news, <ORGANIZATION> Vestron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> will release a new National Geographic series in December: `` The Superliners: Twilight of an Era,'' in which life aboard the Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> 2 is explored; `` Rocky Mountain Beaver Pond,'' a day in the life of the frisky and busy little rodent; `` The Secret Leopard,'' the elusive cat and its habits on the <ORGANIZATION> Masai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. Videos reviewed this week: `` Gaby _ A True Story,'' `` Frantic,'' `` The Unholy.''

 `` Gaby _ A True Story'' -LRB- RCA-Columbia Pictures Home Video; VHS-Beta, $ 79.95; Rated R -RRB-. `` Gaby _ A True Story'' is a remarkable film based on a remarkable life. <PERSON> Gaby </PERSON> <PERSON> Brimmer </PERSON> was born severely disabled by cerebral palsy, very intelligent but able to communicate only by moving her left foot. With the help of a devoted nanny and loving parents, she perseveres, graduates from college and becomes a successful writer. Her proud spirit, good humor and insight triumph again and again. `` Gaby'' is reminiscent of `` The Miracle Worker,'' especially because the nanny -LRB- <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleando </PERSON> in an Oscar-nominated performance -RRB- is so central to <PERSON> Gaby </PERSON>'s emergence from her isolation. <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> is wonderful as <PERSON> Gaby </PERSON>, able to convey a range of emotions with just her left leg and very limited facial expressions. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Liv </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullmann </PERSON> also give excellent performances as <PERSON> Gaby </PERSON>'s parents, who refuse to give up on their daughter and never fail to show their love. Her father says, `` Your foot can write the same words as any philosopher or poet. I refuse to pity you.'' Such support gives her the strength to fight and win admission to public school. Director <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandoki </PERSON> takes chances and succeeds, dealing frankly and romantically with sex between disabled people. His film also is forthright about the frustrations <PERSON> Gaby </PERSON> and a disabled friend feel. It's easy to recognize her anger when <PERSON> Gaby </PERSON> writes, typing with her big toe: `` God is a fly on the wall. Nanny, give me a flyswatter.'' The movie also succeeds at showing what <PERSON> Gaby </PERSON> has in common with all young people _ she tries makeup and beer; there's a peace sign on the back of her wheelchair; she falls in love. `` Gaby'' is warm and witty, funny and sweet. It's easy to watch on a television screen, and well worth seeing. _ By <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacVean </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Frantic'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 89.95; Rated R -RRB- `` Frantic'' is a modest Roman Polanski thriller that takes a plot idea better suited to an hourlong TV drama and pads it into a two-hour movie. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> plays an American heart surgeon who arrives with his wife -LRB- <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> -RRB- for a convention in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, only to have her mysteriously abducted from their hotel room while he is in the shower. His desperation and determination to find her lead him into the Parisian underworld and an unlikely alliance with a young French girl of dubious morals -LRB- <PERSON> Emmanuelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Seigner </PERSON> -RRB-. She is far-and-away the most interesting character in the movie and deserves better than the fate -LRB- shades of `` <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>'' -RRB- that she suffers at Polanski's hands. Polanski invites comparisons to the great <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> with this story of an ordinary man thrust into peril through no fault of his own. But the mood of believable, this-could-happen-to-anyone suspense is shattered after the first half-hour or so and the film becomes a series of improbable chases and confused confrontations. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has to carry most of the movie and tries hard, but his range of expression varies only from extremely anguished to somewhat anguished. All in all, a disappointment from the creator of such original and unsettling films as `` Knife in the Water,'' `` Repulsion'' and `` <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON>'s Baby.'' _ By <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` The Unholy'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Vestron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 89.98; Rated R -RRB- One wonders what <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Holbrook </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON>, <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> are doing in a limp horror movie called `` The Unholy.'' The unemployment lines must be real long in movieland to make such celebrated and talented actors want to embarrass themselves in the Camilo Vila film. The premise is a good one: A horrific demon exists and can only be brought down by the purest of mortal souls. However, the filmmakers cloud the issue with loose ends and vagueness and a plodding plot. The action, such as it is, takes place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> where two priests are brutally slain at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Enter Father <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> -RRB-. He takes over the parish, resists temptation from a young woman named <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> who works at a satanic club, is told by an old blind priest that he is the `` chosen one'' and must fight a demon. So far, so good. But then <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> finds a book that talks about a demon called the Unholy, who preys on the innocent. <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, an unbelievable virgin, thinks the demon is after her, naturally. To save her soul, she thinks she should give herself to Father <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Ahem </LOCATION>. The movie quickly rolls downhill from there culminating in the bloody and silly clash between Father <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and the demon. It's not a bad diversion for the home screen. But if you're a fan of the supernatural, you'll want something a little more devilish. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` Close-Up'' -LRB- Reprise -RRB- _ <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON> The latest offering from <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON> is a lot like his other records _ melodic, upbeat and full of accomplished musicianship. But it's jazz for people who do n't really like jazz. Where jazz is improvisational and daring, <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON> is arranged and methodical. Where jazz allows a musician ultimate freedoms from written music, <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON> and band are chained to the notes. On `` Close-Up,'' <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON> and his band of crack sidemen plow familiar ground. <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON> is an outstanding, albeit unimaginative, saxophonist, and the record is chock full of his full-steam-ahead style and catchy hooks. He knows how to blow a good riff. On tunes such as `` Slam,'' `` Pyramid'' and `` Touch,'' the band lays down a funky, percussion-filled rhythm track that lets <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON> pick out the melody. The songs build to a climax that usually has the leader hitting a high, solid note and then cascading down the keys. Sound familiar? See 1984's `` Straight to the Heart.'' Other tunes show a glimpse of a slightly different <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON>. `` Same Girl'' takes on a mournful quality as a duet between saxophone and piano between <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who wrote or co-wrote five songs on the record. `` J.T.'' also finds <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON> in a lyrical mood, as does `` So Far Away.'' `` Close-Up'' is cleanly produced and includes such session men as <PERSON> Nile </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and `` Saturday Night Live'' guitarist G.E. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who most recently has been touring with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON> never misses a note, and his latest record makes pleasurable listening. It makes one wish he'd take his considerable ability out a bit further on the musical fringe. _ By <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

This time out, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> covers `` Spanish Eyes'' -LRB- with <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON>, no less -RRB-, `` <LOCATION> Moon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>,'' `` Some Enchanted Evening,'' `` To Each His Own'' and six other Revered Standards. These songs are pretty, and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> sings'em pretty. If you liked `` Stardust'' and `` Somewhere Over the Rainbow,'' you'll like this. But for those of us who fear that <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> is becoming the <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the 1980s, who wonder what ever happened to the creator of such classics as `` Crazy'' and `` Night Life'' _ his own classics _ this collection is one more piece of evidence that <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> does n't work here anymore _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Back To Avalon'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Loggins </PERSON> When he's on, <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Loggins </PERSON> is capable of creating impressive pop music, the kind of hook-laden tunes that sound good on car radios and stubbornly refuse to get out of your mind. When he's not, as for most of `` Back to Avalon,'' <PERSON> Loggins </PERSON> deals in ordinary `` soft rock'' that really drags over an album's length. The news here is that `` Back to Avalon'' is <PERSON> Loggins </PERSON>' first album in three years, during which time he has carved out a lucrative sideline making hit songs for movie soundtracks. Not to go out on a limb too much, the new album includes two of those cinema tracks _ the bouncy `` Nobody's Fool,'' a recent hit from `` Caddyshack II,'' and the lush `` Meet Me Halfway'' from the 1987 <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> film, `` Over the Top.'' Opening and closing the album, respectively, they are easily the best songs. The rest of the LP flows from one mid-tempo rocker to another, with breaks for the stately title track and a dance-floor cover of the oldie `` Tell Her.'' <PERSON> Loggins </PERSON> also has a visit from the ubiquitous <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> for a vocal duet on `` She's Dangerous.'' You've heard this one, or something like it, before. On `` Back to Avalon,'' <PERSON> Loggins </PERSON> sounds comfortable as a singles artist but stretched to the limit when faced with the demands of an LP. _ By <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON> did n't need to go far to research his role as a poor Italian immigrant who becomes entangled with the Mafia in <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s new film `` Things Change.'' `` From the standpoint of knowing the character, I probably never played one that I knew any better,'' he said. `` My father was born and raised in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and he did n't come here until he was 25. The accent was totally his; he had it until the day he died. `` Pop was a man of integrity, within the confines of his own concept of what was right and wrong, the same as <PERSON> Gino </PERSON> in ` Things Change.' So things were easy, as far as knowing what to do with this character. The only difference is that <PERSON> Gino </PERSON> is Sicilian, and Pop was from the middle of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON>'s performance as the ingenious cobbler who manages to beat the mobsters at their own game drew a best-actor award -LRB- shared with co-star <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON> -RRB- at the <ORGANIZATION> Venice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> is planning an Oscar campaign for him. The actor has another major film coming this fall: `` Cocoon: The Return,'' repeating the role that brought him the Academy Award as best supporting actor of 1985. Not bad for an 80-year-old. <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON> still looks in wonderment at the events of his so-called sunset years. He said the Oscar came as a complete surprise. `` I did n't believe I would win,'' he recalled. `` Everybody was saying that <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandauer </PERSON> would win. I did n't see ` Out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,' but I understand that he was magnificent in the picture. I was sitting with my oldest son when they announced my name. All I could say was, ` Oh, my God!' `` It meant a lot, but nothing like it means today. When I look at the figure sitting on the living room table, it really means an awful lot.'' <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON> could understand the underworld types of `` Things Change.'' His boyhood was spent in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, where his father operated a saloon frequented by Sicilians. `` When I was 7 or 8 years old, I was sitting in an automobile outside Pop's saloon,'' he reminisced. `` He threw two men out the front door and down the three stone steps. They wound up a few feet from me sitting in the car. Both were Sicilians, and the younger man was beating up the older man. Pretty soon the older man came up with a knife in his hand, with a blade about that long. He hit the other man three times in the front and four more times in the back as he went down. `` Once I poured water on an enormously powerful man that Pop had hit across the shoulders with a baseball bat. We thought he was dead. I poured gallons of water on him until he revived. `` Yes, I saw incredible things in that saloon. I saw it all.'' After four years of drift in college, <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON>'s mellifluous voice made him a popular actor in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> radio. By the mid-1930s, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> was calling. `` I made one test for <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> in August of 1935 that they turned down,'' he said. `` I saw it, and I hated it _ but then I found out later that I hated everything I did. `` An agent, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> was his name, thought he saw something in my test. He showed it to <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanuck </PERSON>, who arranged for me to have a test in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in December of 1935. In January he signed me for one picture, ` Sins of Man,' with one-year options for seven years.'' <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON> settled with his family in <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION>, which was a much different place in 1936: `` <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> was a two-lane concrete road from <LOCATION> Sepulveda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> to where I lived on Louise Avenue. There may have been 40 stores in that two or three miles.'' The stretch is now a high-rise corridor. A versatile actor who was equally at home with musicals, comedies and dramas, <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON> became <PERSON> Zanuck </PERSON>'s busiest star. His most enduring film was `` <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>.'' When his film career waned, he stayed active in other media, returning to the big screen with <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> in `` Trading Places.'' The once-slick hair has thinned, but <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON> remains a vigorous figure at fourscore. His recipe? `` My doctor was a very down-to-earth man with a wonderful outlook on life,'' he said. `` He was a firm advocate in moderation in everything. Drink? All right, but be awfully careful of it. He hated smoking. He recommended exercise, arguing that what did not grow would atrophy, and he said the same thing about a mind. He insisted that if you did n't try to stretch the mind, it was going to atrophy the same as muscles.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pianist <PERSON> Krystian </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimerman </PERSON> has come a long way since the days when audiences only wanted to hear him play <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON>. At the Nov. 14 <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> gala celebrating the 45th anniversary of <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>'s conducting debut with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>, he'll be soloist in <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>'s `` The Age of Anxiety.'' Next year he'll record all the <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> concertos with <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> conducting the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Philharmonic. On Dec. 1, <PERSON> Zimerman </PERSON> will perform the North American premiere of <PERSON> Witold </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutoslawski </PERSON>'s `` Piano Concerto'' with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION> and conductor <PERSON> Zubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON>. He played the world premiere at the <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> during the summer with the composer conducting. `` I'm entirely devoted this time to contemporary music,'' the 32-year-old pianist said in an interview. `` I want to show a different side, because I was usually playing the romantic and classical repertory.'' <PERSON> Zimerman </PERSON> has two new recordings out on <PERSON> Deutsche </PERSON> <PERSON> Grammophon </PERSON>, a Chopin recital, his first <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON> recording in eight years, <PERSON> Liszt </PERSON>'s `` Totentanz'' and two concertos, with the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> conducted by <PERSON> Seiji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozawa </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> DG </ORGANIZATION> has a recording of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' `` Sonata in E flat for Violin and Piano,'' by <PERSON> Zimerman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kyung </PERSON> <PERSON> Wha </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, ready to be released. <PERSON> Zimerman </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Zabrze </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. His father, an architect, started teaching him piano at 5, and soon hired him a teacher. `` He was 24; I was 7,'' <PERSON> Zimerman </PERSON> said. `` Today I look back _ I think it was a blessing I was his first pupil. He did n't have any fixed idea of how learning should go. I could play the most difficult pieces because I wanted to play them. `` He said OK to the Rachmaninoff ` Piano Concerto' when I was 12. I looked forward so much to play this piece I made progress much quicker than playing scales. `` I had the opportunity to play concerts, which I think is important for a kid, to know what you're working for. Music does n't exist without the person who's listening to it. <PERSON> Zimerman </PERSON> remembers growing up in the communist world. `` There were not toys for children,'' he said. `` A piano at home was a big toy. You push a key and the sound is coming, something really incredible. I spent a lot of time sitting at the piano. We were a very poor family. I felt somehow rich.'' He filled in when his father and his musical friends played chamber music. `` I played all the parts. You look at a score and you can swallow it immediately. That gives you a very important skill to play chamber music, which for a pianist is incredibly important. `` A pianist can go through life without playing one note with anybody else. You can phrase however you like,'' he said. `` Chamber music puts you back into the right way of controlling yourself. You ca n't just fly around with phrases as you like.'' At 19 he was the youngest of 118 entrants in the 1975 <ORGANIZATION> Chopin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. He won. `` When you get older, it is more difficult to play in competitions,'' the pianist said. `` I was n't aware of many things and that helped me a lot. My teacher never prepared me to play in a competition. He said, ` You play your music, love the music and do n't care if someone else plays better or not.' `` A jurist said to me when I asked him why did he chose me, ` When you started to play, it was like it was fun. We just enjoyed it.' It is amazing that people can hear anything after 30 pianists. It is the reason I never want to be on a jury. I would probably have terrible doubts and gray hair after voting, if it was the right decision or not.'' <PERSON> Zimerman </PERSON>'s career began after his win, but went slowly for about four years. He could n't afford to stay and tour in a town where he'd played. `` In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> I wanted to hear other concerts, to be in this atmosphere. That was extremely difficult. It took awhile until I was ready to fill the season with so many concerts I could make my existence and could have time to practice and learn new repertory. `` What helped a lot were recordings and the fact that <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> invited me in 1976 to perform in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I think he got a tape from the competition. In 1979, <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbado </PERSON> invited me to his first concert as music director of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Symphony, to open the season. `` At the beginning, no agent wanted to accept me for anything but just <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Zimerman </PERSON> recalled. `` For almost two years I just played <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON> recitals. It is beautiful music but it is like having the same dish all the time. `` So I have tried to expand in all possible directions. On my first recital in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> I played some <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON> and some <PERSON> Szymanowski </PERSON>. He was a great Polish composer nobody plays in the West. He wrote a lot for piano. It would make about 10 records and every piece is something.'' <PERSON> Lutoslawski </PERSON>, who also is from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, wrote his concerto for <PERSON> Zimerman </PERSON> over the last 10 years. `` We were always phoning each other, meeting and talking about it. It's a beautiful concerto, solid writing without any tricks.'' <PERSON> Zimerman </PERSON> is interested in more than music: `` I get 22 monthly magazines about all the fields of science, psychology and art,'' he said. `` I try to resist this specializing in a narrow field. If you look at a tree and know how it grows, you can live more consciously.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Future of the Stones in Doubt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> were like wedded jewels in the rock world, two diamonds in the rough who made the Rolling Stones shimmer for almost three decades. Now that union has become a little jagged at the edge: A feud between the guitarist and the lead singer has left the legendary group's future in doubt. Over the past two years, <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> has pursued a solo career. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> has just come out with his first solo LP, `` Talk Is Cheap,'' and will give his first solo concert Nov. 29 at the Beacon Theater in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I tell him he's blowing 20-odd years of integrity of the Stones because he's got a problem,'' the 43-year-old <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said in an interview at his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office, where pictures of the rock star line the walls. `` I ask him, ` What's your problem. What's so tough about being <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>?' Suddenly you got to complete and be fashionable. The Stones do n't need that. I love the guy and I love to work with him but I do n't understand this star trip he's on.'' On his new album <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> has a song especially for his longtime friend, `` You Do n't Move Me.'' It begins like the Stones' `` Honky Tonk Woman,'' with guitar and drums. The lyrics say: `` What makes you so greedy? What makes you so seedy? Why do you think you got no friends? You drove them all around the bend.'' `` The melody and the beat came about like they usually do,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. `` Songs come to you; you do n't make them. They decide that they're going to visit for a while.'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said he wrote the song about <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> on the advice of drummer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who co-produced the LP. `` At the time I was going to write it, I just dried up. It was frustrating me,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> said to me, ` When in doubt, write about <PERSON> Mick </PERSON>.' He's hurt me a lot and I just had to get it out. It's not entirely about <PERSON> Mick </PERSON>. It's about anybody that gets disappointed about a friend and has to let it out. It's a weird mixture of roughness and melody.'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> played `` You Do n't Move Me'' for <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, who he said talked all the way through it. But <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> thinks the song will eventually sink in. `` After these interviews, he's probably going to go to a room and listen to it. He'll make this a mirror for him instead of just having a mirror for him to look into.'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> have known each for nearly 40 years, living in the same <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Dartford </LOCATION> for a while as children, and forming a lasting friendship as teen-agers based on their mutual interest in blues and rock' n' roll. As <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> tells it, they met on a train around 1960 with <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> carrying a pile of blues albums under his arm. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> was already playing guitar and <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> was doing some singing, so they promptly began rehearsing together. They met up with another guitarist, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, and shared a flat in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, starving as <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> recalls, and playing music. They auditioned for a bassist and decided on <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON>, chosen at the time more for the large amplifier he owned than for his playing. Drummer <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, who had played with <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> in a blues group, joined the Stones in 1963. The Stones began, in <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' words, as `` young missionaries,'' determined to bring blues music to a mass audience. Their name was taken from a Muddy Waters song and much of their early material were covers of blues and soul classics. In 1965, `` The Last Time,'' became their first self-written single to reach the Top 10. Then came, `` Satisfaction,'' No. 1 in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and still the Stones' most famous song. They had the best of both worlds for a while. Critics loved the Stones, naming them `` The World's Greatest Rock' n' Roll Band.'' The fans loved them, not just for their music, but their belligerent attitude. That attitude came at a price. In 1967, <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> were arrested for drugs and briefly jailed. Although the charges were minor, <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> for possession of four amphetamine tablets and <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> for allowing marijuana to be used on his premises, both were given lengthy sentences and the group's future was in doubt. After a public outcry, they were released and the Stones bounced back in 1968 with the single `` Jumpin' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Flash </PERSON>,'' and the album `` Beggar's Banquet.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, however, was suffering from the strain of repeated drug busts and losing his girlfriend, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallenberg </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. He made only a minor contribution to `` Beggar's Banquet,'' and in June of 1969, announced he was leaving the Stones because of `` musical'' differences. He was found dead in his swimming pool a month later.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: a month later.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a 20-year-old blues guitarist, replaced <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and played on some of the Stones' greatest albums: `` Let It Bleed,'' `` Sticky Fingers'' and Exiles on Main Street.'' He left the group in 1974 and his replacement, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, is still with the band. <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> once noted that the Stones had always been able to understand their own abilities and limitations. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> was the singer, <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> -LRB- and occasionally Wood -RRB- the songwriters, <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> the bass player and Watts the drummer. Unlike their onetime rivals, the Beatles, the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION> had each accepted their roles. But <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> sees <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s concentration on his solo career as a departure from that way of thinking. `` <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> and I used to pride ourselves on watching these new bands screw up and make these obvious mistakes. Now it's happened to us,'' he said. What happened was not just <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s recording of two solo albums, but his refusal to tour behind the Stones' most recent LP, 1986's `` Dirty Work.'' `` I made the record to go on the road and suddenly the rug was pulled out from under that,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. `` He took the Stones for granted and thought he could just hire another Stones around the corner.'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> once brushed off the idea of making a solo album, believing that `` bands splintering up for individual members to record their own stuff is pointless.'' Why the change of heart? `` Because if I do n't work I go mad,'' he said. `` At least I fear I'd go mad. Also, over the last couple of years I found the people I wanted to work with. People kept asking me to do it.'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> makes no claim to being a ` natural' singer, although he was a soprano in the choir at <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abbey </LOCATION> and the Festival Royal Hall for three years. `` My voice broke and that was that. My career has gone downhill ever since,'' he said. But he has a way of putting across a song. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> has a generous supply of friends on hand for `` Talk is Cheap'': bassist <PERSON> Bootsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and keyboardist <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrell </PERSON> of Parliament-Funkadelic fame, producer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horns </ORGANIZATION>, session guitarist <PERSON> Waddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> and many others. <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> is also on the record, playing on `` I Could Have Stood You Up,'' a song that shows <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s influence on <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s longtime keyboardist, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, plays on the cut. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> met <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> during `` Hail! Hail! Rock' n' Roll,'' the critically acclaimed concert film on <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. It's been 30 years since <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> first heard <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> and became his most famous fan. The Rolling Stones' first single was a cover of <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s `` Come On.'' The Stones also recorded `` <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>,'' `` Let it Rock,'' `` Around and Around'' and several other <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> songs. Originals such as `` Brown Sugar'' and `` Star Star'' are openly patterned after <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s music. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said exposing <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> and other black artists to white audiences was the primary reason the Stones were formed. `` We were idealistic,'' he said. `` The initial reason for putting the band together was not to make the Rolling Stones stars. We just wanted to turn people on to Muddy Waters and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. We figured if we could play stuff good enough then other people would want to know where we got it.'' Ironically, the Stones developed a sound so distinctive that listeners were often unaware where such songs as `` Time Is on My Side'' and `` It's All Over Now'' came from. But now the Stones are struggling to continue. The early obstacles no longer exist: They no longer have the Beatles to compete with; their days as rock's `` bad boys'' are long gone. `` It can certainly be pulled back together,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. `` The positive side is the stuff I've learned the last two years _ just having that breather, some fresh air.'' Wood has favored a reunion all along. <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> has suggested the group call it quits. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, struggling with his solo career, has said he'd like to record with the Stones again. <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> has left it for the others to decide. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> is optimistic: He sees another Stones album coming out in 1989.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> is a storyteller. `` <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>,'' her third novel, is the story of a storyteller. `` I come from a long order of tradition,'' <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` I used to listen to the maid and cook tell stories in the kitchen. I loved that. I've read stories since I was very little. I grew up with storytelling.'' `` <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Knopf </ORGANIZATION>, $ 18.95 -RRB- takes place in a Latin American country closely resembling <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. The title character is orphaned as a child and grows up poor, working as a domestic. But she soon discovers she can earn a living by telling stories. `` I never realized it was something that I had and that I could trade for something else,'' <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> said. `` Like <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, I realized when I was 40 that I had been trading stories for other goods and making a living of it.'' Storytelling, the author explained, is a way of preserving memory. Since leaving <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> after the 1973 military coup, she has struggled to remember the environment that shaped her as a child. `` I realized about myself that I have lost something that was invisible, that I could not put in words,'' said <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, who became a resident of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. `` The only word I could think of was roots. It's memory.'' And what <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> misses goes beyond specific sights and sounds. Living in a foreign country, she struggles for a sense of identity. `` If you walk in your own city, in your own country with your people, you hear the language of your own country. You have the feeling that somehow you know the subtle rules and you know how to get along. `` When you're taken away from that, you do n't belong anywhere. You're all by yourself, you have no roots and the memory of the past starts fading away.'' So Allende uses her stories to keep the past alive. `` I have the feeling I have lost my family, my country, my friends, the accent of my own language,'' she said. `` But very specifically, the memory _ something that had been with me naturally. Now I'm reconstructing every day. Now it's finally mine, it's printed, portable. I can take it with me.'' <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, whose father was a diplomat, was born in 1942 in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, but moved to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, at the age of 3. She lived comfortably as a child and was spared the poverty under which so many in her country lived. `` I grew up in a world on contrasts _ extreme wealth and extreme poverty,'' she said. `` I belonged to the bubble. That means I've been fortunate, but I was also aware of that inequality Though I was always touched by that, I never came to terms with it until the military coup.'' She married an engineer when she was 19 and had two children. She supported the government of <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allende </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> elected president in 1970. -LRB- The author says she's a distant cousin -RRB-. He was overthrown by the military in 1973 and executed. After Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> took over and declared a state of emergency, he tortured and murdered political opponents and censored the press. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a journalist at the time, recalled the day of the coup: `` I left my house very early in the morning and I went to my job. I saw only soldiers passing in tanks and airplanes and everybody hiding in their homes. I saw the bombing of the -LRB- President's -RRB- palace. That very day, I had the feeling my whole life was changing.'' She was an outspoken opponent of the regime and went into exile in 1975, leaving her family behind. They were later reunited. `` When I learned I could be taken into prison with my children and have them tortured in front of me, it became unbearable. I had to leave,'' she said. Her first novel, `` House of the Spirits,'' was released in 1982 and combined her strong political beliefs with `` magic realism,'' a writing style associated with such Latin American writers as <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>. `` You can not be an artist for the sake of art only in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` I would say the same goes for any country in the world where there is great repression and violence.'' Magic is also essential. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> writes in <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>: `` I was writing a new episode every day, totally immersed in the world. I was creating with the all-encompassing power of words, transformed into a multifaceted being, reproduced to infinity, seeing my own reflection in multiple mirrors, living countless lives, speaking with many voices.'' And magic also is part of her roots: `` It's a combination of legends, superstitions, myths. The Indian culture, the African culture. The dreams of the Spaniards who came here. The possibility of finding Utopia.'' <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>'s second novel, `` Of Love and Shadows,'' came out in 1987, and had the same themes of good and evil, darkness and light, that appear in all her works. She balances <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>'s passionate love affairs with the violence and oppression of the outside world. `` I think that I'm surrounded by violence, shadows, confusion,'' the author said. `` Writing is maybe a naive attempt to make the world more comprehensible, more tolerable. `` Shadows for me are all those things that are threatening and have always been there, are still there. Death, repression, abuse, inequality, mystery _ things in which I'm immersed, constantly.'' <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> is divorced from her first husband and recently married a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer. With Chileans rejecting the presidency of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in a recent plebescite, she will visit the country in December. `` I froze a country 15 years ago and took it with me,'' she said. `` When I go back, I wo n't know where I'll belong. Who will be my friend when I go back?'' But no matter what, <ORGANIZATION> Allende </ORGANIZATION> will go on telling stories. `` <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON> can not only trade the stories, she can make her life better and others around her. She makes the world more tolerable. That's what I try to do all the time.''

 <PERSON> Irlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON>, the youngest of the performing <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON> sisters, believes she'll always be overshadowed by her two versatile siblings. But she's the only one seen weekly on television. She's in her fourth season on `` <PERSON> Hee </PERSON> <PERSON> Haw </PERSON>,'' the syndicated hour-long program of country music and corn pone humor. All three starred in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> variety show, `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON> and the Mandrell Sisters,'' which ran for two seasons ending in 1982. Now country music singer <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON> is seen periodically on television specials while the remaining sister, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>, is seen primarily in a TV shampoo commercial. <PERSON> Irlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON>, in an interview between tapings on the `` Hee Haw'' set, said her sisters are tough acts to compete against. `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> are great showmen,'' she said. `` It would be hard to top them.'' But she's moving in that direction with her comic sketches on `` Hee Haw,'' which is in its 21st season as one of the longest running TV shows in history. On the program, <PERSON> Irlene </PERSON>'s featured segments show her as a telephone operator and a highbrow society figure, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, also known as BMW. As the telephone operator, <PERSON> Irlene </PERSON> is scatterbrained much like her character on the old network Saturday night variety show. `` People are always commenting about the spot, ` I hope I do n't get you as an operator The call would never get through,''' she said. `` It's fun to do,'' she said. `` You get to dress different and use a different accent.'' She also appears regularly in segments set in a general store and truck stop. Her tenure on the program is a return engagement of sorts. Twenty years ago, she was on the show as a drummer in <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>'s band When not busy taping `` <PERSON> Hee </PERSON> <PERSON> Haw </PERSON>,'' Irlene makes personal appearances, does some emcee work and appears occasionally with her sisters at concerts. At those shows, mostly at conventions, she opens the act by singing a number or two. Then <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> sings and plays her fiddle, followed by a segment by <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> before all three join together. `` There's some slapstick like on the old -LRB- network -RRB- show,'' she said. On that program, she often was portrayed as the dippy sister in comedy spots. `` I guess they thought I'm a little dingy,'' she said. `` I miss the show a lot. We really liked to work together. I miss them.'' After the show went out of production, <PERSON> Irlene </PERSON> had two acting roles in the `` Love Boat'' series. She also did some dancing and singing on a road show with the <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Krofft </PERSON> puppets, who had been featured regularly on the variety show. Serious acting, though, is a career ambition. `` I love comedy and I'm trying to get more involved in drama. I'm capable of it. Anything that came up, I could handle.'' But for the past two years, career moves have been delayed by motherhood. `` I end up pregnant every time something is happening,'' she said. `` The last few years I've been mainly mothering which I love. They are No. 1, second only to God.'' <PERSON> Deric </PERSON> is 2, and <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> is about 1. <PERSON> Irlene </PERSON> was born into a musical family in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. She was raised in <LOCATION> Oceanside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, until the <PERSON> Mandrells </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> when she was about 12. `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> was special, even in grade school,'' she recalled. `` To me she's always been a superstar. I remember our grandmother used to tell us not to pound on the piano, but she could tell even then that <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> had musical talent. `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> are both honest, soft hearted and wonderful.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> still does concerts and performs periodically in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> while maintaining a recording career. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>, meanwhile, recently has been the opening act for comedian <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. The careers of all three are managed by their father, <PERSON> Irby </PERSON>, a former singer and guitarist. Their mother also is a former musician. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovullo </PERSON>, producer of `` <PERSON> Hee </PERSON> <PERSON> Haw </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Irlene </PERSON> has done well on the long running program. `` She came from a show where it focused on three people. She's adapted well with the ` <PERSON> Hee </PERSON> <PERSON> Haw </PERSON>' gang.

 As many as 6 percent of Americans may be so obsessed with sex it interferes with their lives, but experts ca n't agree how to treat these `` sex addicts'' _ or even if they're <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a pioneer in the field, says there's no question that sexual addiction exists, and that his patients include men who are `` masturbating 10 to 15 times a day resulting in physical injury, hiring prostitutes on a daily basis, -LRB- or having -RRB- multiple anonymous sexual encounters without any regard to risk of health or commitments to family or relationships.'' The concept has become increasingly popular in recent years, spurring the creation self-help groups modeled after Alcoholics Anonymous. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a psychologist who founded the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> chapter of Sex Addicts Anonymous, has estimated that up to 6 percent of Americans are addicts. However, sociologists <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Troiden </PERSON> wrote in the August issue of the Journal of Sex Research that the sex addict theory amounts to `` transforming sin into sickness.'' `` There's no such disease as sexual addiction or sexual compulsion. It does n't exist,'' said <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, at <ORGANIZATION> Bloomfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` You ca n't be addicted to sex. Addiction is a physiological dependency on a substance.'' He and Troiden, of <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, wrote that `` the invention of sexual addiction and sexual compulsion as ` diseases' threatens the civil liberties of sexually variant peoples'' like homosexuals. `` Mental health professionals must remain cautious about endorsing concepts which may serve as ` billy clubs' for driving the erotically unconventional into the traditional sexual fold,'' they cautioned. While not addictive in the chemical sense, `` these behavior patterns are pathological, self-defeating,'' said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a psychologist in the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s human sexuality program. `` These individuals display hypersexuality in response to feelings of anxiety, depression or loneliness. Many describe a sexual act as a ` fix' to some very negative feeling. But this relief is short-lived and negative feelings recur.'' Dr. <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Crenshaw </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> physician and sex therapist who served on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s AIDS commission, said the sex addicts she treats `` want help. They do n't like the behavior. It is not ordinarily a diagnosis superimposed from the outside ... `` It's a compulsive behavior pattern the person continues to repeat in spite of disruption to marriage or primary relationships, in spite of self-disgust.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said self-help groups like Sex Addicts Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous simply try `` to shut down the sexual behavior and not deal with the underlying problem'' for those who are unhappy because their frequent sexual behavior violates moral standards. `` It used to be that people said, ` The devil made me do this.' Now they say, ` My disease made me do this.' If you enter the role of being a sick person, you're not responsible for the behavior, he said. `` The treatment is to get them to repress their sexuality _ restrict their sexual experience only to an emotional relationship, preferably marriage. The problem is it does n't deal with the underlying forces that make them feel so worthless about themselves. `` It's their sense of worthlessness that pushes them to engage in sexual behavior that violates their values. If you remove that behavior, you remove the only comfort or antidote they have for their misery.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said he and other sexual addiction therapy pioneers agree that underlying feelings of worthlessness must be treated, and that `` none of them advocate simply suppression of sexual behavior.'' Treatments such as the 30-day sexual dependency program at <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> `` help people learn how to be sexual in healthy ways,'' while self-help groups let sex addicts know they are n't alone and encourage members to obtain professional therapy, said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who lectures there. But `` there is no unanimity of treatment,'' he said. `` Some view this as a psychiatric conditon and treat it with medications. Others treat it with psychoanalytic or behavioral therapy. Others adapted the methods of treating alcohol addiction.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said the sex addiction-compulsion concept `` appeals to most Americans because ... if you're engaging in behavior that traditionally has been defined as sin, transforming it into a disease absolves you of any moral failing.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> insisted that sex addicts who seek treatment are accepting responsibility, and self-help groups `` do not relieve them of responsibility, but they do try to relieve them of shame.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said when a disease-like label like sex addict is applied to people they can be forced to get treatment, and that the notion of addiction can be used to justify attacks on homosexuality and other sex outside of marriage. A person's sexual behavior should be considered a problem only if it makes them unhappy, involves an unwilling partner or directly harms others, he said. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> acknowledged that resarchers `` do not have any objective criteria to say who is sexually compulsive or addictive,'' so such labels `` could be used as a measure of sexual oppression of sexual minorities.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Troiden </PERSON> view the notion of sexual addiction as a product of increasingly conservative <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values, a backlash to the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, the upsurge in Christian fundamentalism, increased emphasis on monogamy and commitment, and fear of AIDS, herpes and other sexually transmitted diseases. Hypersexuality `` was a psychological and medical issue long before it was politicized by those who feared it could be misapplied to them,'' <PERSON> Crenshaw </PERSON> said. Some homosexual men resist the notion of addiction because it threatens what they consider their right to anonymous sex with multiple partners, she added. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said his own homosexuality did n't influence his opinion. The term sexual compulsion was coined by homosexual therapists to explain why some gay men continued to engage in unsafe sex with multiple partners despite the deadly threat of AIDS, he added. `` The points <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and Troiden raise are reasonable ones,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>, editor of the Journal of Sex Research and a psychologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> said their essay `` will force a re-evaluation of the concept of sexual addiction and compulsivity. This article has engendered a lot of debate about the feasibility of using such a label for the purpose of maligning a sexual lifestyle.''

<HEAD>Television Viewing Contributes to Record Number of Obese
Youngsters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Young Americans are more overweight than ever, a `` fattening of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' that one researcher blames on a generation of couch potatoes that spends as much time watching television as in the classroom. Rates of obesity among children and adolescents went up an average of about 45 percent between 1960 and the early 1980s, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortmaker </PERSON>, associate professor and acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Behavioral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. A key factor in explaining the rise are 1983 studies that show children spend an average of at least 25 hours a week in front of the television, said <PERSON> Gortmaker </PERSON>, who speculated that the actual number of viewing hours is higher. `` Television viewing for children is now practically a full-time job equal to the time spent in school,'' he said, adding that television viewing is up from an average of 18 hours per week in 1968. Diet, a general decline in physical activity, and TV commercials that reinforce the appeal of high-calorie foods contribute to the dramatic increase in overweight youths, said <PERSON> Gortmaker </PERSON>, who explained his `` couch potato hypothesis'' last month at an American <ORGANIZATION> Dietetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting. The link between TV-watching and obesity rates holds true for adults, too, he said. One study showed that adults who watch an hour of television a day or less have a 3 percent chance of being obese, compared to a 25 percent chance of obesity among adults who watch three hours per day. Specifically, <PERSON> Gortmaker </PERSON> found that between the late 1960s and 1980, obesity rates went up 54 percent among children aged 6 to 11. Super-obesity rates went up 98 percent in the same age group. Among youths aged 12 to 17, obesity went up 39 percent and super-obesity rose by 64 percent. Obesity and super-obesity were measured with a skinfold test that does not readily translate into percentage of body fat or other measurements, he said. The greatest increase among males was between the ages of 6 and 11, and the biggest among females was in those aged 12 to 17. Obesity was less prevalent among blacks than whites, but that gap has narrowed recently, he said. Obesity is equally prevalent among wealthy and poor children, <PERSON> Gortmaker </PERSON> found. The greatest number of obese youths are found in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> while the fewest are west of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Obese children face health risks including hypertension, psycho-social damage, respiratory and orthopedic problems. They also tend to become overweight adults, <PERSON> Gortmaker </PERSON> said. To counter the trend, he recommended individualized programs to target overweight youth, and school and community-based nutrition programs. In another presentation, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreyt </PERSON>, an associate professor at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, reported that dieting has become the norm among <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women and has become common among young children. `` We have become a nation obsessed with body shape, body size. Women in particular are not satisfied with their bodies today, either size or shape,'' he said. `` It's not uncommon to see children in second, third and fourth grade begin to abnormally restrict their caloric intake.'' One study revealed that a group of well-meaning parents, fearful that their infants would become obese, actually caused nutritional dwarfing in their babies by restricting their food intake. Although the average <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> man would like to lose one pound, the average woman wants to lose eleven pounds, he said. `` Why is this? We today have the first generation of girls growing up whose mothers had tremendous pressures to diet.'' Popular images, including beauty queens and models, feature women who typically weigh only 82 percent of average body weight, <PERSON> Foreyt </PERSON> said, warning that such images can have harmful psychological effects on women who compare themselves to these `` very, very skinny women.'' Chronic dieting, `` cycling,'' can lead to harmful food obsessions, emotional problems including depression, anxiety and withdrawal, and physical changes from sleep disturbance to lowered metabolic rate that can inhibit weight loss. <PERSON> Foreyt </PERSON> urged health care professionals to address the underlying psychological issues, eating habits and unattainable goals that contribute to chronic dieting, and said, `` Mild obesity in women does not constitute a health risk for women.''

<HEAD>Archaeological Research Underway At Hanford Nuclear Reservation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Archaeologists are starting to study <ORGANIZATION> Wanapum </ORGANIZATION> and Palouse villages up to 2,500 years old, and more modern non-Indian settlements, that have been preserved largely because of national security. The 126 archaeological sites _ 20 of them non-Indian _ lie within the 570-square-mile <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> reservation that makes fuel for nuclear weapons. `` It's an irony that the protection offered Hanford because of its national defense role allowed these sites to be protected,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chatters </PERSON>, who was hired last year as the first Hanford archaeologist. `` The majority of archaeological deposits throughout this region have been destroyed or covered by hydroelectric development, agricultural activities and domestic and industrial construction,'' Chatters said as he crouched inside a stone hunting blind created by Indians thousands of years ago. The heavy security that kept the public out of the sprawling federal plutonium production site for more than 40 years also preserved a collection of Indian villages, cemeteries and artifacts. The arid Hanford site was once home to 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> Wanapum </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Palouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, who lived along the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and stalked deer and salmon. They went to reservations and up to 2,000 whites moved in at the turn of the century. But the area remained largely empty until the government created the nuclear reservation in 1943 as part of the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project. Officials for <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, which contracts most Hanford research, recently arranged the first press tour of archaeological sites. Reporters were taken to the remains of a large Indian village and to the hunting blind, essentially a round stone hiding place built into the side of a canyon where hunters waited to kill passing deer. They are among the most dramatic remains of 10,000 years of human activity in the area, said Chatters, who is developing a plan to manage and preserve the sites. `` There are probably more intact archaeological sites here than anywhere else in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. The majority of the sites do n't seem to have been disturbed.'' Perhaps the most important discovery was the site of a large <ORGANIZATION> Wanapum </ORGANIZATION> Indian village, which at one time had at least 60 housepits and may have been occupied for 2,500 years, he said. It is one of the two largest in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, along with the <LOCATION> Strawberry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> site at the mouth of the <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The village is now a series of circular depressions, overgrown with weeds, along with tool fragments, animal bones and other signs of human habitation. The homes were pits dug into the ground and covered with wood and mat roofs, averaging about 400 square feet and sheltering around a dozen people, Chatters said. There has been no excavation of the site yet. Hanford was where the <ORGANIZATION> Wanapum </ORGANIZATION> prophet <PERSON> Smohalla </PERSON> held the first `` washat'' dance, which became central to the `` Washane'' religion still practiced by some Indians on the nearby <LOCATION> Colville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Umatilla </LOCATION>, Warm Springs and Yakima Indian reservations, Chatters said. But the same security that kept out looters also kept area tribes from sacred religious sites. Those restrictions have eased with the end of plutonium production, and negotiations are under way for more access. While part of Chatters' job is advising the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> on Indian concerns, the tribes do not fully support his work. `` We're seen as gravediggers by the Indians,'' he said. Non-Indian sites include the former townships of White Bluffs, <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ringold </PERSON>, whose residents were turned out of their homes in the 1940s in a parallel with the Indian relocation a few decades earlier. Also, Chatters said, the nine reactors that produced plutonium, including the material for the bomb that destroyed <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, are historic. The B Reactor, the first at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, is being considered for preservation and development as a national historic site. `` Our purpose is not to judge the social or political merits of what we're preserving,'' he said. `` The reactor's importance is much greater than the hunting blind's, which fed a few families.''

While not addictive in the chemical sense, `` these behavior patterns are pathological, self-defeating,'' said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a psychologist in the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s human sexuality program. `` These individuals display hypersexuality in response to feelings of anxiety, depression or loneliness. Many describe a sexual act as a ` fix' to some very negative feeling. But this relief is short-lived and negative feelings recur.'' Dr. <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Crenshaw </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> physician and sex therapist who served on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s AIDS commission, said the sex addicts she treats `` want help. They do n't like the behavior.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said self-help groups like Sex Addicts Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous simply try `` to shut down the sexual behavior and not deal with the underlying problem'' for those who are unhappy because their frequent sexual behavior violates moral standards. `` It's their sense of worthlessness that pushes them to engage in sexual behavior that violates their values. If you remove that behavior, you remove the only comfort or antidote they have for their misery.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said he and other sexual addiction therapy pioneers agree that underlying feelings of worthlessness must be treated, and that `` none of them advocate simply suppression of sexual behavior.'' `` There is no unanimity of treatment,'' he said. `` Some view this as a psychiatric conditon and treat it with medications. Others treat it with psychoanalytic or behavioral therapy. Others adapted the methods of treating alcohol addiction.''

<HEAD>Television Viewing Contributes to Record Number of Obese</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Young Americans are more overweight than ever, a `` fattening of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' that one researcher blames on a generation of couch potatoes that spends as much time watching television as in the classroom. Rates of obesity among children and adolescents went up an average of about 45 percent between 1960 and the early 1980s, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortmaker </PERSON>, acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Behavioral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. A key factor in explaining the rise are 1983 studies that show children spend an average of at least 25 hours a week in front of the television, said <PERSON> Gortmaker </PERSON>, who speculated that the actual number of viewing hours is higher. Diet, a general decline in physical activity, and TV commercials that reinforce the appeal of high-calorie foods contribute to the dramatic increase in overweight youths, said <PERSON> Gortmaker </PERSON>, who explained his `` couch potato hypothesis'' last month at an American <ORGANIZATION> Dietetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting. The link between TV-watching and obesity rates holds true for adults, too, he said. One study showed that adults who watch an hour of television a day or less have a 3 percent chance of being obese, compared to a 25 percent chance of obesity among adults who watch three hours per day.

<HEAD>Archaeological Research Underway At Hanford Nuclear Reservation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Archaeologists are starting to study <ORGANIZATION> Wanapum </ORGANIZATION> and Palouse villages up to 2,500 years old, and more modern non-Indian settlements, that have been preserved largely because of national security. The 126 archaeological sites _ 20 of them non-Indian _ lie within the 570-square-mile <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> reservation that makes fuel for nuclear weapons. `` It's an irony that the protection offered Hanford because of its national defense role allowed these sites to be protected,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chatters </PERSON>, who was hired last year as the first Hanford archaeologist. The arid Hanford site was once home to 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> Wanapum </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Palouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, who lived along the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and stalked deer and salmon. They went to reservations and up to 2,000 whites moved in at the turn of the century. But the area remained largely empty until the government created the nuclear reservation in 1943 as part of the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project. `` There are probably more intact archaeological sites here than anywhere else in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. The majority of the sites do n't seem to have been disturbed,'' said Chatters. Perhaps the most important discovery was the site of a large <ORGANIZATION> Wanapum </ORGANIZATION> village, which at one time had at least 60 housepits and may have been occupied for 2,500 years, he said. It is one of the two largest in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, along with the <LOCATION> Strawberry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> site at the mouth of the <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The village is now a series of circular depressions, overgrown with weeds, along with tool fragments, animal bones and other signs of human habitation. The homes were pits dug into the ground and covered with wood and mat roofs, averaging about 400 square feet and sheltering around a dozen people, Chatters said. There has been no excavation of the site yet. Also, Chatters said, the nine reactors that produced plutonium, including the material for the bomb that destroyed <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, are historic. The B Reactor, the first at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, is being considered for preservation and development as a national historic site.

<HEAD>Smoking Lowers Risk of Colorectal Cancer in Older Women, Study
Suggests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women smokers older than 65 were less than half as likely as non-smokers to develop colorectal cancer in a recent study. This does n't mean women should light up, because the decreased risk is outweighed by health harm from smoking, researchers said. The study does provide new evidence, however, that the female hormone estrogen plays a role in colorectal cancer, they said. Previous studies suggested smoking interferes with estrogen function and that estrogen levels might be linked to the risk of colorectal cancer. Better understanding of estrogen's role could lead to new treatments, researchers say. For the new study, researchers looked back at the records of 25,369 white women whose smoking status was known in 1963 to see how many had developed colorectal cancer by 1975. The colorectal cancer risk for 4,338 smokers who were 65 or older in 1963 was estimated to be 42 percent of that of their nonsmoking counterparts. Smokers younger than 55 ran an elevated risk. The work is reported in the Oct. 19 Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> by researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hygiene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hagerstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in Research Triangle Park, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Children of Diabetic Mothers May Get Partial Protection From</HEAD>

 Diabetes
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Children of diabetic mothers may have some protection against developing diabetes themselves because of their exposure to the mother before birth, a study suggests. Their immune systems may be affected before birth in a way that makes them less likely to develop diabetes than children of diabetic fathers are, the study's authors say. The study dealt with insulin-dependent diabetes _ the kind that requires daily insulin shots. Children of diabetic mothers run a higher diabetes risk than those of normal mothers, but by one estimate they are only a quarter as likely to develop diabetes as are children of diabetic fathers. Until recent decades, children of diabetic mothers were more likely to be stillborn or die as newborns than were children of diabetic fathers. Some researchers had speculated the early deaths may have culled out children who would later have developed diabetes, thus lowering the diabetes rate among survivors. But the new study found no support for that speculation, because it showed that the rate of such early deaths in 1,602 pregnancies was unrelated to the diabetes rate in the survivors. Researchers cited an alternative explanation for the lowered diabetes rate. Insulin-dependent diabetes occurs when the body's disease-fighting immune system attacks insulin-producing cells of the pancreas Perhaps something in a diabetic mother enables the fetal immune system to avoid such an attack, the researchers say. The study was done by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Warram </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Krolewski </PERSON> and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Joslin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and was published in the October issue of the journal Diabetes.

<HEAD>Tubes Or Not Ear Tubes, That Is the Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New studies cast doubt on the value of surgically installed ear tubes to relieve fluid buildup in children with middle-ear infections. The surgery, which costs about $ 1,000, has surpassed tonsillectomy as the most common operation on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> children. But pediatricians are divided about the operation's safety. `` The adverse consequences may be significant compared to treatment with antibiotics,'' Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichichero </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said during the recent 28th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. He studied more than 100 children, about half of whom received six or more treatements with antibiotics and half of whom had received three or more sets of ear tubes for recurrent middle-ear infections. Roughly 50 percent of the ear-tube group experienced some hearing loss _ a worrisome consequence of middle-ear infections. Less than 5 percent of the antibiotic group showed hearing loss. <PERSON> Pichicherio </PERSON> does n't yet know whether the hearing loss will be permanent. The ear-tube group also suffered eardrum damage far more often. Doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, treated 105 babies under age 1, using antibiotics, ear tubes or both. After 10 days, they found infection persisted in 63 percent of the babies who had surgery, 11 percent of the babies who received antibiotics and 13 percent of the babies who got both treatments. However, there are cases in which there is no alternative to ear tubes, including those where children are allergic or unresponsive to antibiotics, or have had fluid in an ear for three or more months, Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bluestone </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> ear-nose-throat specialist, said during the recent <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

 The Christmas tree has its roots firmly planted in the fertile soil of American tradition, nostalgia and the Ellipse south of the White House. Official lighting ceremonies for the living <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> blue spruce will be held Dec. 15 this year, with President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expected to preside for their final time. Transplanted from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> a decade ago, it is known officially as the National Community Christmas Tree and serves as the focus of the annual Pageant of Peace. In addition to that national Christmas tree, a variety of smaller trees will mark the holiday season in the capital city. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is maintaining tradition by supplying a tree for the White House. The national grower's group condcts an annual contest with the winner getting to send a tree to the Executive Mansion. This year the tree is coming from <ORGANIZATION> Snowcrest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montello </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, operated by <PERSON> Irv </PERSON> <PERSON> Daggett </PERSON>. A score of other trees including those at the Capitol are provided by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The centerpiece tree for the Capitol this year will be a 50-foot balsam fir scheduled to be cut Nov. 26 in the <ORGANIZATION> Manitee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Lighting of that tree will be Dec. 14, on the West Lawn of the Capitol. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will also provide trees for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> dining rooms, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> and a variety of other federal agencies. The lighting of a national Christmas tree began only with President <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> in 1923, but having such a tree in the White House goes back at least to <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> in 1856. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> once tried to discourage the use of Christmas trees, fearing that their popularity would deplete the forests. But the tradition, older than the nation itself, continues. Indeed, it likely stems from tree-worshiping religions that flourished in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> thousands of years ago. Use of greenery indoors at festival times has been reported from the Roman era, but the first instance of Christmas Trees was seen in the 1600s in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, coming to this country with the many waves of immigrants from that nation. In addition to trees, popular seasonal decorations include holly, ivy, mistletoe and, on occasion, nearly any other green plant that can symbolize faith in the coming of spring. One custom apparently English in origin and currently widely popular is kissing under mistletoe. The ancient Druids and Norsemen long considered this plant to have magical qualities, expecting it to cure some diseases, promote fertility, nullify poison and avert misfortune.

 Rockefeller Center was still a muddy construction site when Christmas was first celebrated around its now-famous tree. That was in 1931, in the midst of the Depression, when construction workers happy to be employed got their Christmas Eve paychecks around the tree they had set up in the dirt. Two years later, the formal tree lighting tradition at the midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> site began when the tree was decorated with 700 lights and placed in front of the then-8-month-old RCA Building. In 1936, the Rockefeller Plaza outdoor ice skating rink was opened. This year's tree lighting, with more than 18,000 multicolored lights, takes place at 5:30 p.m. Dec. 5 and will be nationally televised later that evening. The tree is a 75-foot <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> spruce from <LOCATION> Raritan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. Other Christmas attractions at Rockefeller Center are the display of trumpeting angels in the adjacent Channel Gardens and the `` TubaChristmas'' concert, set for Dec. 11 The Christmas show at Radio City Music Hall runs from Nov. 11 through Jan. 4.

 Christmas season brings a special cheer each year to more than 100 unemployed people in the Appalachian foothills of <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> _ a warm, happy feeling that comes from receiving a long-awaited paycheck. The small army of jobless workers descends on the Christmas Ridge Handcrafts factory near the community of <PERSON> Tyner </PERSON> every year in late October. They man an assembly line until mid-December making thousands of natural pine and fir wreaths for shipment across the country. `` It gives them an opportunity to buy things at Christmas for their children and grandchildren that they might not otherwise have,'' says <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrett </PERSON>, quality control chief at the factory, operated by the non-profit Christian Appalachian Project -LRB- CAP -RRB-. Unemployment in the southeastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> county has hovered well above the 10 percent mark for most of 1988, peaking at 18.5 percent in February. Ms. <PERSON> Parrett </PERSON> says most workers in the wreath factory are women, many of whose husbands and sons must travel 40 to 80 miles out of the mountains to find work in larger towns. <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, marketing director for the factory, says Christmas Ridge Handcrafts plans this year to produce about 65,000 wreaths that sell at between $ 13 and $ 30. The factory, in three old school buildings, shipped about 51,000 wreaths in 1987, he says. `` The income from the wreath business is put back in to help create more jobs for the area,'' says <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>. He said about $ 1 million the factory is projected to earn this year would go to support other CAP craft businesses. Ms. <PERSON> Parrett </PERSON> says the wreath factory began more than 20 years ago, when about 10 women put together the decorations in an unheated tobacco barn a local farmer allowed them to use. Output and employment has grown steadily each year since then. Production of the wreaths begins with bending wire, about the same gauge as used in thick clothes hangers, into 10-inch hoops. After wire clasps are spot-welded onto the hoops, workers attach ample helpings of fir or pine and the thick green wreaths begin to take shape. The unfinished wreaths then are placed on tobacco sticks in a storeroom until another crew places bows, pine cones and artificial cranberries on them and slides the completed products into shipping boxes. The finished wreaths measure 22 inches across and are 4 inches thick. Although the factory used <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> pine for many years, <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> says most of the evergreen material now comes from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, and is stored in 14 refrigerated semi-trailers at the factory. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> says the factory accepts written orders for the wreaths from anywhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the CAP office in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, 40446. Christmas Ridge wreaths are sold primarily through direct-mail promotions, which <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> says has yielded declining returns during the past few years. He says the factory also makes wreaths for several mail order catalogs and has started selling the products this year as part of fund-raising projects for other non-profit groups.

 While thousands of Americans will sit down to a feast of turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and other assorted fixings this year, the first Thanksgiving celebrated by Pilgrims and Indians was a more modest affair. Venison and cod, lobster and sea bass, squash, beans and artichokes probably comprised at least part of the historic peace-feast between the Wampanoag Indians and the Pilgrim settlers 367 years ago. In the fall of 1621, the 52 men, women and children who survived the first year in the New World after leaving <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on the <PERSON> Mayflower </PERSON> decided to hold a celebratory feast. Fifty others died of frostbite, pneumonia and starvation. Just four adult housewives survived the first winter. `` Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on fowling, that so we might after a special manner rejoice together after we had gathered the fruit of our labors,'' <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON>, a Pilgrim, wrote in a first-hand report of the feast. The three-day secular celebration was held sometime between Sept. 21 and Nov. 9, according to historians at <ORGANIZATION> Plimoth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plantation </ORGANIZATION>, a Pilgrim village re-creation in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>. Two primary references from the first Thanksgiving remain, including a diary kept by Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>. They show that the feast included cod, sea bass, wildfowl such as geese, ducks and swans, wild turkeys, corn meal and five deer brought by the Indians, about 90 of whom attended. The turkeys, though, were dry and stringy, and the meat was probably boiled. Some of the vegetables were eaten raw but most were boiled. Cranberries, plentiful in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, also were served. Beer was the liquid of choice, even for children, since the water was considered unreliable. Among the desserts served were pudding and ashcakes, cornmeal cakes baked in ashes. There was no cider, because apple and other fruit trees would take years to bear fruit after planting. No potatoes, no corn on the cob, no molasses, no coffee or tea either. The Pilgrims and Indians broke a variety of breads at cloth-covered tables sitting on benches; some of the important men had chairs. There were some knives and forks, but no spoons. Hands were the utensils of choice. The feast was formalized under President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who set aside Thursday, Nov. 26, 1790, as the first officials day of Thanksgiving for `` the many signal favors of Almighty God.'' But it was n't until 1863 that Thanksgiving Day became an annual holiday, decreed by President <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> during the Civil War. These days, the town of <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> stages events to commemorate the first Thanksgiving, including a public dinner at Memorial Hall that normally attracts about 2,000 people. Many of the town's attractions, including <ORGANIZATION> Cranberry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the Mayflower II replica and the 1627 <LOCATION> Pilgrim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> remain open on the holiday.

 It was in the year 165 B.C. that <PERSON> Judah </PERSON> <PERSON> Macabee </PERSON> and his followers defeated three Syrian generals and recaptured and rededicated the temple at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Jews around the world still celebrate the event, Hanukkah, an eight-day holiday which this year begins the night of Dec. 3. Hanukkah, the festival of lights, is one of the few holidays that unites Israeli Jews, divided at other times along religious and secular lines. Secular Jews observe it as a celebration of the victory by the small band of Jewish rebels over their mighty Syrian rulers as a symbol for modern-day Zionism. Religious Jews emphasize an ancient miracle said to have occurred at the temple after it was liberated, when an eternal flame burned for eight days on oil that should have lasted one day. Whatever their level of observance, almost all Israeli Jews at some time light the menorah, the holy lamp that recalls the story of <PERSON> Judah </PERSON> and his followers. Jewish tradition holds that when the rebels were purifying the temple of pagan rituals performed by the Syrians, they found enough oil for only one day to relight an eternal flame. But miraculously, the flame burned eight days until more oil arrived. While the traditional menorah is described in the Bible as having seven candlesticks, a special candlelabrum with nine candlesticks _ the hanykkiyah _ is used only to celebrate Hanukkah For the eight days of Hanukkah, Jews celebrate by lighting an additional candle each night on the candlelabrum.

Children receive small sums of money, known as Hanukkah `` gelt'' in Yiddish, or the traditional four-sided spinning top called a `` dreidel.'' Many believe that Hanukkah gift-giving became popular in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of the holiday's proximity to Christmas.

 Toys, toys, toys, toys, toys, toys. Toys to the left of us; toys to the right of us. Toys up this aisle and toys down that one. Baubles, trinkets, playthings, dolls, video games, board games, card games, construction games. It's little wonder that <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s beard is white. The nation's retailers are expected to provide some 150,000 items to choose from this holiday season, with more than 5,000 of them new this year. Yet, caution seems to be the watchword for both customer and retailer, says <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, president of the the <ORGANIZATION> Toy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association. `` Retailers are cautious, extremely slow in placing orders this year,'' he says, `` and in the kinds of toys they order, too. They're taking fewer chances. Customers are more conservative, too.'' Industry growth is seen as `` a little flat,'' as it was in 1986 and 1987, when sales were the same, $ 12.5 billion. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> sees this year as a continuation of the `` cooling off and consolidation'' time, still `` quite good,'' but less successful than the 1983-1985 period of exceptional business that he says was caused by a sudden consumer interest in Cabbage Patch dolls, the Trivial Pursuit board game and Transformer toys. He sees these trends in toys for this season: _ A continuing resurgence of popularity in video games, especially among young boys. Led by <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> products, this area has had the biggest effect in sales and will continue, he says. Last year's home video game sales were estimated at more than $ 1 billion. _ Board games will continue to be strong. Pictionary, from The Games Gang, has been a sales leader, he says, with nearly 10 million copies sold since it was introduced. -LRB- The Games Gang now follows up with <PERSON> Balderdash </PERSON>, promoted as `` the hilarious bluffing game,'' based on definitions for zany, yet real words. There's now a second edition of Pictionary and a junior version. -RRB- _ `` Back to basics'' toys remain popular, like the `` good play value'' of <ORGANIZATION> Fisher-Price </ORGANIZATION> product, make-believe-type toys and `` construction'' toys, from <PERSON> Duplo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lego </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Tyco </ORGANIZATION> as well as <ORGANIZATION> Fisher-Price </ORGANIZATION>. On this theory that `` everything old is new again,'' Creative Playthings is re-introducing some of its more popular outdoor wooden playgrounds and accessories. `` All a child needs is one block of wood,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessel </PERSON>, executive vice president of Creative Playthings. `` Children will be creative through their own imagination and that one block of wood will become anything that the child dreams of.''

 When shopping for children this holiday season, avoid the fad toys, suggests an association of early childhood professionals. Fad toys often bore children quickly, says <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bredekamp </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NAEYC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. `` There is a reason the same toys are played with generation after generation _ wooden blocks, crayons, puzzles, trucks, dolls, and so forth,'' she says. `` It's because they meet the need that young children have always had and will always have.'' She has some other ideas: _ Know the age of the child you're buying for, especially up to age 3. `` When in doubt about what a child might like,'' she says, `` pick something he or she will grow into within six months.'' _ Buy toys that involve the child, not that only entertain. _ Price has no bearing on the interest a child will have in a toy. `` Many favorite activities of children involve inexpensive articles _ packsts of colored construction paper, a box of chalk, plastic stacking cups, harmonicas,'' she says.

 Some of the worst toys for children are the expensive gimmicky spectator type, such as talking dolls and bears because they do things as the child watches passively, according to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lochhead </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>. Such toys squelch the child's imagination and limit play, explains <PERSON> Lochhead </PERSON>, director of the university's Center for Cognitive Research Processes. The best toys, he says, are low cost, low tech toys that offer imaginative play _ unpainted wooden blocks that help teach geometric patterns and mathematical concepts and the educational toys often found in schools.

 Parents who've finally gotten used to their kids firing light guns at the television or being lost for hours in electronic labyrinths may want to brace themselves for this year's Christmas offerings from the video game makers. Among the gadgets being introduced this season are game sets that can sub for home computers, game cartridges with memories that rival business computers, and a rug that plays music when you dance on it. The mainstays, however, are still the fantasies that let youngsters believe they can out-shoot, out-fight, out-drive and out-wit the bigger bad guys. Home video games were the hot seller among toys last Christmas, with 1987 total sales reaching about $ 1.1 billion, says market leader <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But this year, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> and its competitors say, total sales should more than double. Just a few years ago, video games were considered an outdated fad. While consumers had paid $ 3 billion a year for games and game cartridges in the early 1980s, industry experts say that by 1985, sales had fallen to about $ 100 million, with manufacturers letting $ 35 game cartridges go for $ 5 or less. That year, however, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd. of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, began test-marketing a new game system that had been a runaway success with the Japanese The Nintendo Entertainment System, essentially a small computer, control panels, and game cartridges containing computer chips, offered more intricate games with higher-quality graphics and sound. Folks in this country liked it, too, and <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>, manufacturer of such hit arcade games as <PERSON> Donkey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Bros. </PERSON>, led a comeback for the video-game market. This year, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> and its two main rivals, <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, forecast the total video game market at up to $ 2.3 billion, with perhaps 8 million units being sold. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindner </PERSON> says the <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON>, Wash.-based company and its licensees anticipate garnering $ 1.7 billion of the total. <PERSON> Lindner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> estimates its current market share at 77.4 percent, with <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> at 13.3 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sega </ORGANIZATION> at 4.1 percent. He gets an argument from <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION>'s entertainment electronics division in <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> pegs his company's dollar share of the market at 20 Another objection comes from <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, vice president of marketing and product development for <ORGANIZATION> Sega </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, who says <ORGANIZATION> Sega </ORGANIZATION> expects about a 13 percent share. Whatever those numbers might be, here are some that might be of more interest to shoppers: Expect to pay anywhere from $ 50 to $ 150 for a game set, and from $ 15 to over $ 50 for a game cartridge, depending on features and complexity. Most of <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s games run about $ 35. The top-selling game has been `` The Legend of <PERSON> Zelda </PERSON>,'' a fantasy adventure. However, <PERSON> Lindner </PERSON> says it's about to be overtaken by `` Super Mario Bros.. II,'' the latest adventures of <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON>, who made their arcade reputation by battling Bowsers and Mushroom People `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s Punch-Out,'' a boxing game plugged by the heavyweight champ, and two racing games, `` R.C. Pro-Am'' and `` Excitebike,'' also are doing well, <PERSON> Lindner </PERSON> says. <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION>, which started this whole business back in the 1970s, when founder <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON> cooked up a game called `` Pong,'' this year is offering three different systems, starting with the 2600, which retails at about $ 50. The 2600 was the machine that led the first video game boom, from 1976-1983. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> says it now sells for about $ 50, a third of what it was a decade ago, while game cartridges are all under $ 15. Hundreds of games are available, but among the top sellers are such old favorites as `` Pole Position,'' a race-car game, and arcade standards `` Centipede'' and `` Ms. Pac Man.'' At the mid-price level, around $ 80, is <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION>'s 7800 system, which can run more complicated games, along with those made for the 2600. Game cartridges go for $ 20 and under, with the best seller being `` One-on-One Basketball,'' promoted by <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> `` Dr. J'' <PERSON> Erving </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION>'s top-of-the-line is the XE, `` an ultimate game system but also a beginning computer,'' says <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>. With 64 kilobytes of memory, a keyboard, a joystick and light gun, the system can play games similar to those offered for home computer, and even act as a word processor. `` Hardball,'' a baseball game, is among the top sellers, as is `` Fight Night,'' a boxing game. Sega offers a basic system for $ 79 that includes the game machine, two controllers and a built-in game, says Ms. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. Adding a light gun and another game brings the price to $ 99, while the deluxe set, with 3-D glasses, brings it to $ 149. <ORGANIZATION> Sega </ORGANIZATION> is introducing 12 new games, including `` Monopoly,'' `` Shinobi,'' a karate game, `` Thunderblade,'' a helicopter attack game, and `` Double Dragon,'' a version of an arcade game in which a couple of guys rescue a girl. At the top of its list, however, is `` Phantasy Star,'' a role-playing adventure designed to compete with `` Legend of <PERSON> Zelda </PERSON>.'' The games range from about $ 25 to $ 45, except for `` Phantasy Star,'' which sells for over $ 50.

 In the coming weeks, as stores and shopping malls fill with people buying Christmas gifts, it might look like any other holiday season. But the bustle will mask the fact that cautious consumer spending has forced retailers to take a subdued approach to this Christmas and their prospects for meaningful sales growth in the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, stores are expected to have a profitable season. `` Last year, I played <PERSON> Ebenezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Scrooge </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` This year I'm a little more upbeat _ especially with respect to earnings _ because of the constructive steps the retailers have taken in recognition of slower sales.'' Said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON>, vice president for marketing at <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, `` Christmas is going to be very competitive, but no reason to be gnashing one's teeth over the consumer who does n't seem to have much enthusiasm.'' Estimates of sales growth this season range from 4 percent to 6 percent over Christmas 1987 levels, or about the pace of inflation so far this year. That's what economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> calls `` a mediocre Christmas, not a terrible one.'' `` People are a little bit nervous about the economy,'' said <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, Mass.-based economic forecasting service. `` It's been a year since the -LRB- stock market -RRB- crash, but I do n't think the crash has entirely left their minds,'' he said Higher interest rates, relatively weak growth in income and a low savings rate are also contributing to consumers' uneasiness, <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. Christmas is make-it-or-break it time for retailers because they earn as much of 60 percent of their annual profits during the fourth quarter. But even if this season proves to be unexciting, there is little fear that earnings will suffer. `` Retailers are generally lean on their inventories heading into Christmas,'' said <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>. Less merchandise on hand means less merchandise to be marked down at the end of the season.

 Forty years ago, when the late songwriter <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> penned his first draft of `` Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' he was unhappy with it _ so unhappy he thought it was the worst song he ever wrote. In fact, Marks' dissatisfaction was such that he put the song aside and did n't get back to it until the following year. But in 1949, while humming the melody during a walk near his home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, the composer hit upon a solution: Instead of having the notes in the unsatisfactory opening bars dropping down the scale, he reversed the progression and had them go up. Asked how long it took to complete the new version, Marks replied: `` It took me only two weeks, but 20 years of songwriting to learn what to throw away.'' Since then, `` <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>'' has been a spectacular success. According to one record industry source, it has been translated into nearly every language and sold approximately 150 million records, more than 8 million copies of sheet music and 25 million copies of 200 arrangements for orchestras, bands and choral groups. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Autry </PERSON> first recorded it and gave the first live performance of the song at a rodeo at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Madison Square Garden, changing the finale of his show from `` Ghost Riders in the Sky'' to `` Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.'' Marks, who died in 1985, often was called `` Mr. Christmas of the music world.'' Among his other holiday compositions were `` I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,'' `` Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree'' and `` A Holly Jolly Christmas.'' Perhaps the most memorable of Christmas songs, however, is `` White Christmas.'' Sung by <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> in the 1942 movie, `` Holiday Inn,'' it became <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>'s greatest hit and resulted in the 1954 movie `` White Christmas,'' starring <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Clooney </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Vera-Ellen </LOCATION>. Written during World War II, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has said `` it was nostalgic for a lot of boys who were n't home for Christmas.'' It's been a lot more than that, perhaps the second most popular Christmas song ever, to `` Silent Night.'' In 1973, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claus </ORGANIZATION> gave its first award to Marks, for `` <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>,'' and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, for `` White Christmas,'' in recognition of their contribution to the spirit of Christmas. Runners-up were <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' `` A Christmas Carol'' and <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s ``' T was the Night Before Christmas. Another Christmas song, `` Silver Bells,'' was written by <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> for Christmas sequences of a <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> film comedy, `` The Lemon Drop Kid'' -LRB- 1951 -RRB-. It became the biggest seller for the song-writing team. One of the many joys of the 1944 movie, `` Meet Me in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' was <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>'s singing `` Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas'' by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Blane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>.

 The film world has long been fascinated with the yuletide season. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' `` A Christmas <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>,'' the time-worn tale of Scrooge and <PERSON> Tiny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tim </PERSON>, may well be the most recurrent of the Christmas movies. It appeared in several versions during the silent era, then <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> made a 1938 `` A Christmas Carol'' with <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> as <PERSON> Scrooge </PERSON>. In 1951, the English did their own version with <PERSON> Alistair </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> as the legendary penny-pincher -LRB- the British had done an undistinguished `` Scrooge'' in 1935 -RRB-. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> was unrecognizable in the title role of the 1970 `` Scrooge,'' and a recent version starring <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> has become a television perennial. A couple of years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> company enlisted all of its cartoon stars for a featurette `` Mickey's Christmas <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>.'' The song `` White Christmas,'' sung by <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> in the 1942 film, `` Holiday Inn,'' became <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>'s greatest hit and resulted in the 1954 movie, `` White Christmas.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON>'s unabashed sentiment often resulted in Christmas scenes, notably in `` Meet <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'' and `` It's a Wonderful Life.'' The latter shows up regularly on holiday television. Oddly, most films with `` Christmas'' in the title have fared poorly at the box office. `` The Christmas Tree,'' starring <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Virna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisi </PERSON>, was a 1969 bomb. In 1944, Universal cast its biggest star, <PERSON> Deanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, in a grim melodrama with <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, `` Christmas Holiday.'' Audiences voted overwhelmingly for <PERSON> Deanna </PERSON> to return to musicals. Other misfires: `` Christmas Eve,'' three wayward sons -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Raft </PERSON>, <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> -RRB- return to their mother -LRB- <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> -RRB- for the holiday -LRB- 1944 -RRB-; `` Christmas in July,'' a tame satire of the advertising industry by <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturges </PERSON> -LRB- 1940 -RRB-; `` Christmas in July,'' a soap opera with <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanwyck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> -LRB- 1945 -RRB-. Disney had little luck with `` One Magic Christmas,'' a Capra-esque fantasy starring <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Steenburgen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>.

 That winter wish list for well-stocked wallets, the <ORGANIZATION> Neiman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marcus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> catalog, this year reflects that not everything is better in pairs, providing a lift for Yuletide spirits with a `` his-or-hers'' hot-air balloon. But for conspicuous holiday consumers, the company that introduced his-and-hers camels, dirigibles and spangled cats is not saying that togetherness is out of vogue with the affluent. Featured in the catalog is the <PERSON> Neiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloudhopper </PERSON>, a 30-foot-tall hot-air balloon that fits into an automobile trunk and onto the back of its rider. `` We only have one balloon, the Cloudhopper,'' says company spokeswoman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Zajac </PERSON>. `` Only one can ride in it. Of course, if 20 people want one, that's no problem. We are prepared to provide as many Cloudhoppers as the world wants.'' Constructed by Per Lindstrand of Thunder and <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Balloons </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the `` fantasy of free-flight'' sells for a mere $ 18,000. `` We always look for things that are unexpected, unusual,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Zajac </PERSON>, `` and this is the world's first backpack balloon. `` It's the most compact balloon ever offered to the public,'' she says. `` It's a backpack balloon that fits in the trunk of a car as a whole unit.'' Not all the catalog gifts are for loners. But like an upscale `` Easy Rider,'' a customer can take to the road riding a limited edition <ORGANIZATION> Harley-Davidson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Softail </ORGANIZATION> motorcycle with customized seat and sporting a matching helmet and his-or-hers black leather jacket with silver studs. `` <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> would love it,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Zajac </PERSON>, referring to the publishing magnate who owns a collection of motorcycles. `` You are seeing more CEOs and business people out on the road with their motorcycles. `` <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> loves the color purple. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> has supplied her with her own violet motorcycle.'' The wanderlust may strike Christmas shoppers in a more down-to-earth way. For $ 25,000, you can take a 10-day bicycle tour of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tuscany </LOCATION> Region on custom <PERSON> Cinelli </PERSON> touring bikes, which may be personalized with your monogram or family crest The romantic tour for two, `` the <LOCATION> Tuscany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turismo </LOCATION>,'' comes with a deluxe motor coach and a driver-guide to accompany the riders, who can room at luxurious country inns and villas through the trip. This year, the gift selection contains a touch of humor. There's a silver-plated baby bottle for a budding corporate chief executive officer at $ 25 `` We have taken the baby from silver spoon in mouth to bottle,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Zajac </PERSON>. Other novelties include an edible chocolate chess set, giant milk - and white-chocolate postage stamp replicas, brooches of metal and precious stones depicting official birds of the 50 states and a set of howling coyote salt and pepper shakers, handmade in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> by a native artist Ms. <PERSON> Zajac </PERSON> says 3.2 million <PERSON> Neiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> catalogs were mailed to shoppers worldwide. `` Through the years, we have tried to appeal to the humor and the child in all of us,'' she says. `` We try to approach the merchandising of the Christmas book with humor and whimsy. If nothing else, it is a wish book for those who read it.''

 The holiday season can bring out the worst in Christmas shoppers when it comes to irrational buying, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> marketing expert. `` When we feel depressed by the season, it's not uncommon for us to go out and buy items we do n't want or need, just to pick up our spirits,'' says <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON>, chairman of the university's marketing department Another holiday buying trend, he says, indicates shoppers also find it much easier to spend lots of money on several smaller items and avoid the one major ticket item. For many busy families, according to another <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor, stress is intensified during the yuletide season. `` Christmas is particularly stressful for two-income families attempting to balance the demands of jobs with personal expectations of family togetherness and holiday activities,'' says <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brubaker </PERSON>, director of the university's Family and Child Studies Center. `` Addressing Christmas cards can be a major chore, much less baking and decorating cookies or entertaining, and the interruption in routines caused by school holidays adds to the tension,'' he says. <PERSON> Brubaker </PERSON>, who edits `` Family Relations,'' a journal of applied family and child studies published by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>, also believes holiday media images do n't help with their portrayal of `` traditional'' families and career couples who are always at home. Reality is much different, he says, noting that according to the 1987 census both mothers and fathers are employed in 57 percent of two-parent families with children 6 or under. And then there is the matter of New Year's resolutions. Many people find their will power to follow through on the resolutions begins to falter by early February because of a complex mind game called `` self-handicapping,'' says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, professor of social psychology at the university. `` Self-handicapping gives people an excuse so that if a situation fails, it's not their fault,'' <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> explains. `` For example, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> could get a date if she lost weight. However, if she loses the weight and still ca n't get a date, she no longer has a ready reason. Having an excuse for failure is much less threatening than thinking we are not capable of succeeding.''

 The Holidays are here, the Holidays are there, the Holidays are, in fact, nearly everywhere. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must love its holidays, at least judging by the files of the federal government, since the nation has no fewer than 110 places called Holiday. From Holiday Hills, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, to Holiday Acres, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, and from <LOCATION> Holiday </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, to Holiday Resort, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, these festive appellations sprinkle the land. And that's not all. A look at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>'s Geographic Names Information System shows 89 Christmases across the country, along with seven places called <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>, three Yules -LRB- all in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> -RRB- and even one poinsettia _ <LOCATION> Poinsettia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> The U.S.G.S. names information system, which has collected more than 2 million names of places and geographic features for use in federal mapping and data programs, shows <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is tops in Christmas country with 10 places using that name, while there are three Christmases in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and seven each in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. There's Christmas Knob in <LOCATION> Oneida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and Christmas Cove in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Christmas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and Christmas Landing in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Presiding over Christmas are the seven Santa Clauses, including the community of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Toombs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. Others include <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> churches in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>; locations called <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> For the decorative, there are 542 spots nationwide called holly, more than enough to decorate the lone wreath: <LOCATION> Wreath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. Folks more inclined to snuggle up and kiss on the holidays can find ample comfort in a dozen Mistletoes. Mistletoe Mine in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> might be a good spot, since it's no longer active; or perhaps <LOCATION> Mistletoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. They could walk Mistletoe Trail in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, study their skills at <ORGANIZATION> Mistletoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shasta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, drift across <LOCATION> Mistletoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and perhaps even end their days at Mistletoe Cemetery in <LOCATION> Goliad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. If festive song is desired, some 30 <ORGANIZATION> Noels </ORGANIZATION> mark this land from <LOCATION> Noel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Creek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>.; <PERSON> Noel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and even <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditch </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seneca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Looking for a white Christmas? Perhaps it can be found at the nation's 563 `` snow'' place names. There's <LOCATION> Snow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, where a white Christmas is likely, and Snow Brake in <LOCATION> Tallahatchie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, where the chance is smaller.

And just to round up the seasonal decorations with a traditional Christmas Tree, the nation's place names include 5,073 spots with `` pine'' in their names, as well as 98 `` spruces,'' 735 `` balsams'' and 130 places named `` fir. `` Tinsel'' appears only twice _ for lakes in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ but for other decorations there are 129 `` garland'' locations as well as 358 `` bells,'' 138 `` angels'' and 434 places in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with `` light'' in their names.

 Is firing people during the holidays cruel or kind, and could this actually be an opportune time to be out of work? According to <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON>, associate professor of management and human resources at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, there is no good time to get laid off from work. But a holiday firing can present natural opportunities to network, says <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON>, author of `` Working It Out: Sanity and Success in the Workplace.'' `` People are usually very supportive and sympathetic,'' he says, `` because we all easily identify with the individual who has been fired.'' <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> adds that holidays can be a good time for job hunting because `` many companies review their budgets and staff changes often are made at the first of the year.''

 The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen today despite intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, while share prices rose slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 125.00 yen, down 1.08 yen from Friday's finish at 126.08 yen Opening at 125.72 yen, the currency fell and ranged from 124.98-125 .85 yen `` The central bank intervened a few times, but it did n't work,'' said <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawai </PERSON>, a dealer with the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

We do n't give out any information about our activities,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

They said investors' generally felt the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy was slowing down and that was driving the dollar down <PERSON> Kawai </PERSON> said the dollar-selling mood was still strong in the market. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 219.67-point winner Saturday, gained 21.53 more points, or 0.08 percent, to end at 27,982.54. The market has risen six straight days starting last Tuesday. The Nikkei topped the 28,000 level at mid-morning today for the first time since Sept. 19, when Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> fell seriously ill. But profit-taking and fears about the continued rise in share prices over the last five trading days gradually pressed the Nikkei back below the 28,000-point level toward the end of the trading, dealers said. In a moderate trading with volume on the first section estimated at $ 1.1 billion, food, drugs and paper issues attracted investors.

 Chinese officials are taking pains to assure foreign businesses that their contracts will be honored despite plans to slash domestic spending and shut down hundreds of domestic companies. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s handling of its latest austerity drive, the third since it opened to foreign trade and investment in 1978, shows a new awareness of the need to temper the effect of policy swings and avoid frightening away foreign investors considered key to development. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, Vice Premier <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiyun </PERSON>, Trade Minister <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuobin </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> all have promised in recent weeks that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 9,700 foreign joint ventures will be exempt from austerity measures intended to stem a 20-percent inflation. `` All signed contracts for ordering goods and joint ventures will be implemented,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> told about 200 visiting chief executive officers of American companies on Oct. 17. He repeated the same message later in the week to a Japanese banking delegation. The Bank of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the chief Chinese lender to joint ventures, said it will continue doing so. One of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading investment and trade companies, the <ORGANIZATION> Kang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been stripped of trade rights and ordered to divest many subsidiaries as punishment for illegal operations, promised it will carry out all contracts already signed with foreign companies. <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> has signed about 4,000 import and export contracts worth a total of $ 670 million since being founded 17 months ago. The assurances seem to be having their desired effect. Foreign businessmen and diplomats in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said they expect a drop in Chinese import orders but not a significant reduction in joint venture activity. Most seemed confident the impact would be minimal. One predicted delays in signing new contracts, however, as the central government scrutinizes local projects more closely to weed out any not deemed essential. Chinese officials say consumption and industrial growth must be slowed and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> must reassert central control over the economy to restore order to a market in which excessive demand has generated inflation, hoarding and black marketeering. Foreign companies that sell factory equipment, raw materials and luxuries to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, from cars to air conditioners, can expect a drop in orders. Import taxes on a wide range of goods have been increased and calls have been issued for import substitution where possible. However, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> told the chief executive officers that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> remains interested in joint projects in energy, transportation, communications, raw material production and high-technology. Foreign companies that want to manufacture consumer appliances in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, such as televisions and refrigerators, are welcome only if their products are for export, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. The government also has said the construction of hotels, auditoriums and other public buildings will be sharply curtailed. Companies found guilty of illegal transactions, such as buying and selling scarce goods on the black market, will be closed and companies set up by government offices will be shut down or spun off. Specifics, such as which projects will be halted and which Chinese companies reorganized or closed, have been slow to emerge, and foreign businessmen said it was too early to predict the eventual impact. There have been no reports of casualties in the form of canceled contract talks. The government also ordered slowdowns in economic growth in 1980 and 1985 when it ran short of foreign currency reserves needed for imports. Some joint ventures were halted in <LOCATION> midstream </LOCATION> or canceled, as were many import orders. `` At that time -LRB- the Chinese -RRB- had no cash,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat. `` Now it's different, they have the cash. They're trying to pause and think.''

 Budget Rent A <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will be acquired for $ 333 million by an investment group led by <ORGANIZATION> Gibbons </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amerongen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and Budget's management in a deal financed primarily by the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, officials said today. Budget, the nation's third-largest rental car company and the only one still publicly held, said <ORGANIZATION> Beech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would pay $ 30 a share for the Chicago-based company's 11.1 million outstanding shares. Budget closed Friday at $ 17.12 -LCB- in over-the-counter trading. The deal was struck Sunday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Budget spokeswoman <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. This will be the second time in two years that Budget has been taken private by <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> and Budget's management. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, an investment banking firm, is the general partner of the investment company that owns <ORGANIZATION> Beech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement calls for Budget's management to purchase voting shares of <ORGANIZATION> Beech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> and continue to operate Budget. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s financing will be through a purchase of non-voting shares of <ORGANIZATION> Beech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Budget </PERSON> said in a statement. Budget did not reveal the amount of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s investment. As part of the deal, Budget and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> signed a long-term agreement to maintain their existing supply relationship, <PERSON> Budget </PERSON> said. Budget is the nation's third-largest car-rental agency, behind No. 1 <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> and second-ranked <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> already has a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION>. Budget went public in May 1987 at $ 14 a share. It was previously held by <ORGANIZATION> Transamerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which sold Budget in 1986 in a leveraged buyout to <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>'s senior management. Budget reported its third-quarter earnings rose 57 percent to a $ 8.8 million, compared with $ 5.6 million in the third quarter of 1987. Its third-quarter revenue was $ 152.1 million, 32 percent higher than the $ 115.6 million recorded for the same period of 1987, Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said.

 Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with the soybean market leading the way on a combination of technical buy signals and indications of stronger export demand. Analysts said professionals who watch trends on price charts had turned bullish on the soybean market following Friday's late rally, which appeared to mark a turnaround in the market's direction. Most of the news last week was bearish for beans and `` when a market stops going down on negative news, it's always a sign to technicians that we've just about sold off enough, at least for the near term,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON>, director of commodities research with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based commodities brokerage. <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON> also said a large foreign grain company was positioned to take delivery of a large amount of soybeans, which the market saw as a positive sign on the export sales front. In early trading, wheat was 2 -RCB- cents to 4 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.14 a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 2 cents higher with December at $ 2.80 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.36 a bushel; and soybeans were 4 cents lower to 7 cents higher with November at $ 7.75 a bushel.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will end production of its <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> LeBaron GTS and <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lancer </ORGANIZATION> automobiles in March because of slumping sales, an automotive newsletter said Monday. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s Automotive Reports said halting production of the models, called H-cars by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, will result in a few layoffs at the company's <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> plant. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoll </PERSON> said Monday he had no comment on future production or product plans.

The Sterling Heights plant will shift to making just the Shadow and Sundance models, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s said, quoting plant sources. <PERSON> Nicoll </PERSON> said the Shadow-Sundance cars account for 92 percent of the cars coming off the assembly line at the <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> plant, the rest being LeBaron GTS and Lancer models. Through September of this year, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s said, LeBaron GTS sales have slipped to 13,000 from 25,000 a year ago, a 48 percent decline. Lancer sales have dropped to 9,000 in the January-September period this year from 19,000 during the same time last year, a 52.6 percent decline.

 The unprecedented, mid-October frenzy of buyout bids that hit Wall Street has spawned its biggest deal yet, a $ 13.1 billion mega-buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. that would create the world's biggest consumer products company The proposed combination announced Sunday _ if successful, the biggest ever between two non-oil <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies _ would end a short but intense takeover battle between the two giant food and consumer goods companies. It also would create a $ 40 billion-a-year company armed with some of the nation's best-known consumer products, including <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>' Miller beer, Marlboro cigarettes, Jell-O and <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> coffee, and <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s Velveeta processed cheese, Parkay margarine, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> cream cheese, Miracle Whip salad dressing and Sealtest ice cream. That would fulfill <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>' goal of reducing its dependence on revenue from its slowing cigarette business, while making it a tougher worldwide competitor against other giant multinationals. `` As we have stated from the outset, we believe the combination of <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> will create a U.S.-based food company that will compete more effectively in world food markets,'' stated <PERSON> Hamish </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s products provide an excellent complement to our existing product lines and position us to capitalize on marketing opportunities worldwide,'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said. In a joint announcement, the companies said they had a definitive agreement for <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> to boost its outstanding tender offer for all of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s outstanding stock to $ 106 a share from $ 90. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> shares closed at $ 96.50, up $ 2 a share, Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> closed down 25 cents at $ 94.75 a share. In midday trading today, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> was up $ 1.75 a share at $ 96.50, while <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> rose $ 7 a share to $ 103.50. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> had rejected as inadequate the $ 90 a share offer made on Oct. 17, and unveiled a defensive restructuring it said would pay its stockholders $ 110 a share in cash and securities. The restructuring _ thought by many analysts to be mainly a bargaining ploy _ also would have boosted the company's debt load by about $ 12.4 billion, likely forcing <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> to sell some of its businesses in order to raise cash for making debt payments. Last Tuesday, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> said it would negotiate only if <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> sweetened its offer to $ 110 a share or more, and sharply stated it would not be pressured into a buyout. After negotiations last Friday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, company officials hammered out a preliminary agreement that the <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> board of directors approved at a Sunday meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` Our shareholders are receiving full value, and this merger is the best possible outcome for our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> chairman and chief executive, stated Sunday. If completed, the merger would rank in size behind only the $ 13.4 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by what is now <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. With combined revenue of about $ 39.5 billion in the year ended June 30, the company would rank as the world's biggest consumer products maker, outpacing the $ 30 billion-a-year British-Dutch company <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION>, according to industry estimates. The combination of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> acquired for $ 5.6 billion in 1985, would produce about $ 20 billion in annual revenue, making <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> the world's second-biggest food company after <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s $ 28 billion <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> The proposed buyout comes on the heels of a stunning mid-October wave of multibillion-dollar takeover bids focusing on food companies, which heightened the importance of being able to compete with the international behemoths. Still pending is a $ 20.3 billion buyout proposal by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for food and tobacco giant <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Also pending are a $ 5.23 billion hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 1.4 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by rival textile maker <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 941.2 million bid for <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, two of the nation's biggest poultry processors <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said his company had no plans to sell any major <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> assets and believed the cash flow of the combined companies should be sufficient for paying off the massive debt. He said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> already had $ 12 billion in bank financing in place, which combined with cash on hand was enough to complete the buyout. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said that despite the enormous costs of paying off the huge debt, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was expecting `` good improvement over this year'' in its earnings for 1989 and 1990. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> also echoed the observations of industry analysts who have said a combination of the companies would mean greater efficiency in areas such as advertising and food distribution, while <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s international presence could help overseas marketing of General Foods products. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> has been restructuring for several years in an effort to shed its non-food operations. In 1986, the company formed <ORGANIZATION> Premark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to spin off its consumer products operations. With the $ 1.8 billion sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION> batteries unit this summer to a management group led by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> returned to its roots as a food and food services concern. <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, for its part, has been attempting to reduce its earnings dependence on the profitable but undependable tobacco business, which accounts for about 78 percent of its earnings, according to analysts. As part of that strategy, it acquired General Foods. The tender offer expires at midnight Nov. 15 unless extended. The deal is subject to a majority of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> shares being tendered and federal antitrust clearance being given. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> has indicated he did not anticipate any antitrust problems because the companies' products compete in different market segments. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> and up to two other present members of the <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> board of directors were expected to join the <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> board of directors. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> also was to be nominated as a vice chairman, responsible for plans and programs aimed at maximizing benefits from the joining of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> last year posted a profit of $ 489 million, or $ 3.60 a share, on revenue of $ 9.9 billion. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had an overall profit of $ 1.84 billion, or $ 7.75 per share, on revenue of $ 27.7 billion.

<TEXT>
 The number of working oil and gas rigs declined by 10 this week to total 923, industry watcher <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The decline follows an increase of eight the previous week and a rise of 11 two weeks ago. A year ago, the count was 1,131, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. The count is the widely watched industry index of drilling activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the number of working rigs since 1940. In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2. Among major oil producing states, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had the sharpest drop with seven fewer rigs, with <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> slipping by five; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> three; and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> with one each. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> posted the largest gain with five additional rigs, with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> adding three apiece; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, two each; and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, one each.

 If nothing else, it's a lesson in Economics 101: <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> junior <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Falgout </PERSON> invested $ 21 in lecture notes and turned a possible F into a B in biology. A `` subscription'' of 48 issues from a note-taking service helped the enterprising <PERSON> Falgout </PERSON> flesh out his understanding of a difficult subject. And with the help of the store-bought notes, he could even afford to miss a lecture or two. In an age when it seems everything can be had for a price, lecture note sales are booming in college towns around the country, fueled by rising demand from underachievers and overachievers alike. `` We like to consider it a supplement to your own notes, but there are a lot of students who skip class,'' said <PERSON> Criss </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, manager of Paradigm Notes in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which sells the written word on everything from anthropology to economics. Paradigm enjoyed so much success in its 14 years that it opened stores in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and inspired a former customer to open a shop in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. The companies pay graduate students and college seniors with good grades to attend classes and take notes for the publications. `` There are some professors who say, ` Paradigm notetakers, do n't put this in your notes,' and we honor that,'' said <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> That allows a professor to slip in a key point or reveal a test question to students who do attend class without actually punishing those who skip, she said. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatton </PERSON>, 26, said Paradigm helped her get through school and four years later, she opened Grade A Notes across from <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, home to 60,000 students. `` It's one of the largest universities and it did n't already have a note-taking service,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Gatton </PERSON>, who expects to triple her business and earn her first profit this university quarter. Grade A opened in September of 1987 and earned modest revenues of $ 60,000 in its first school year. This month, the company expanded its note offerings and nearly doubled the size of its office. `` Business has been great ... -LRB- but -RRB- we still get students who come in and say ` Gosh, I did n't know you were here. This is great,''' said Ms. <PERSON> Gatton </PERSON>, who plans to franchise in 10 more big campus towns in the next five years. Most of these services sell notes by the class for about $ 2 or by subscription, for $ 18 - $ 24 per quarter or semester The note takers have 24-48 hours to turn in their type-written notes. Most are paid $ 10 to cover a 50-minute class session. `` It's great money. I wish I had the GPA -LRB- grade point average -RRB-, I'd be a note taker,'' said <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemp </PERSON>, 23, an office employee of Notes & amp; Quotes, which opened in the fall of 1986 near <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> State in <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>. Some educators feel the service encourages students to cut class. On most campuses, the note-taking companies are required to obtain professor approval before sending someone in, but the universities generally do not have official policies on the matter. `` It's not banned by the dean. I would encourage -LRB- instructors -RRB- to ban it and would never allow it in my own classes, but it never came up for formal discussion,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION> with 38,000 students. It did, however, come up for discussion in the history department at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. `` It -LRB- Paradigm -RRB- was thrown out about four years ago,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Levack </PERSON>, acting chairman of the department. `` We thought it discouraged people from coming to class and therefore we expressed unanimous departmental disapproval.'' The companies' main advertising vehicles are word-of-mouth and leaflets circulated outside of classes. `` That's part of the territory and we never leaflet on Friday. Kids blow off the classes then,'' said Hemp. Note takers earn most of their business in large introductory lecture classes. `` Problem-solving classes are n't suitable for note taking,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magee </PERSON>, owner of Notes & amp; Quotes in <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION>. `` We're pretty limited in scope. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> biology professor <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> is so fond of the idea, he turns over his own lecture notes to Paradigm. `` I have n't found a good textbook for my class so it gives them something to fall back on,'' he said. `` There are a lot of business majors here who are n't interested in biology, but want to do well. You can get an A in this class without attending.'' He said many professors disapprove of the service because it's disheartening to look out into a lecture hall that seats 300 and see only 50 students `` Sometimes it's a blow to the ego,'' <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Does Consumer Confidence Mean Political Status Quo?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As the election draws near, the question becomes more significant: How much will economic views influence the votes of Americans? A cynical axiom of politics suggests that people vote with their pocketbooks, and that all issues debated in a campaign become distilled into that one consideration seconds before the lever is pulled. If that were so, it might be good news for incumbents, but it may not be so this year because of an oddity of politics: Rather than promoting their causes, many of the candidates have been doing themselves in. That view comes from outside the political arena, from an economist who has spent years studying the financial health, habits and activities of Americans. Says economist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>: `` It seems that every front-runner figured out a way to handicap himself, helping to assure that victory would be more difficult if not impossible to achieve, where once it may have appeared in the bag.'' <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, observes that if the president had the power to call for elections at any time, right now would seem to be a good time. The reason: In September, 29 percent of all consumers said government was doing a good job, the highest level in several years. Nearly one-half felt economic policy was `` fair,'' and only 20 percent felt it was doing poorly. Such approval ratings, as measured by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, are unheard of after eight years in office, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> says. Add to this the finding that 62.5 percent of the over-16 population is employed, and a relatively low and stable inflation rate `` and you have the ingredients of a substantial victory for the incumbents.'' As if to nail it down, consumer optimisim is about as high as it has been in the expansion, and the percentage of people reporting they are financially better off than a year ago is near the expansion peak. But, while <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> still feels the economic statistics suggest the Republicans will be successful, he wonders about the impact of political behavior on the economic evidence. `` The campaign has resembled a competititon between two boys for the affection of one girl, with each trying to tell things about the other that will make the young lady look less favorably on the opponent,'' he says. The young lady, however, is looking for someone with courage, says the dean. `` She is looking for a leader who talks positively about the future, has a plan, is willing to take the ` moral high ground,' and of course can convey all this with a good TV image.'' He concludes from this premise that three-fourths of the voters wish they had a different choice, a situation that makes those positive economic perceptions a bit less certain than they used to be as guides to action.

 After 65 years, the production lines at one of <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s oldest plants will grind to a halt this month and the factory that once made radiators for the Model T will close its doors for good. For the last 2 -LCB- years, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employees who did n't accept transfers to <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, have dealt with the grim reality that their jobs would soon be gone. `` I have to relate it to a person who has cancer. You have that hope that you're going to be cured and finally you realize that there's no hope. It's all gone,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Roti </PERSON> <PERSON> Roti </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 930 </ORGANIZATION>. The radiator and heater-core plant, which employed nearly 1,500 in 1973, is scheduled to close Nov. 30 in this upstate community of less than 3,000, about 150 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is switching to aluminum radiators and heater cores instead of using copper and brass. They will be made in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The historic plant _ located on a <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> site handpicked by <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> during a 1916 camping trip _ will be gutted and sold for between $ 5 million and $ 6 million, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s plant area manager A stone displayed at the plant with the initials of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and his camping companions _ <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> Sr. _ may be donated to a museum, <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON> said. When <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> built the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> plant, one of nine hydropower plants he erected by 1925, the automaker believed that building factories in rural areas would allow farmers to work during winter months at his plants. `` Manufacturing, instead of being concentrated in a few centers, should be and can be widely distributed,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> wrote. How the members of Local 930 wish <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s statement had withstood the test of time. But company officials determined that to convert the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> plant, which had revenues totaling more than $ 67.9 million in 1987, into an aluminum radiator facility would not be worth the cost. It would cost $ 3 million more annually to make the products in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON> said. Workers say perhaps the one blessing of their dismal situation was that they had plenty of advance warning about the shutdown. The time helped some plan for the future and gave others a chance to work overtime and save money. It also gave them more time to hold false hopes that things would turn around. First, union members fought to keep the plant open, even going so far as to leaflet shareholders at a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> meeting in 1986. They hoped for a new <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> product, a new owner, an employee-owned factory _ and then set their minds on protecting as best they could those who would inevitably be jobless. By October, radiator assembly line equipment had been torn out of the 287,000-square-foot plant _ much already carted away. Employees still working on heater core lines not far from the windows that look out on the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> spoke wistfully as they looked at the empty spaces where their friends once worked. `` How can you feel, you know? You ca n't really feel anything. You just wait for it -LRB- the shutdown -RRB- to happen,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourdeau </PERSON>, 46, a 22-year plant veteran who does n't know what he'll be doing for a living as of Dec. 1 `` Everybody was hoping until the last minute,'' said <PERSON> Bourdeau </PERSON>. Productivity never dropped, even after layoffs and the shutdown were announced. There was no sabotage. Most of the workers, who average in age at 50, have about 20 years of service and earn between $ 14 and $ 17 an hour, just wanted to make it to retirement, said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaillancourt </PERSON>, 45, who's worked there 23 years. <PERSON> Vaillancourt </PERSON> opted not to take the transfer offer to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and planned to make his part-time job as a charter bus driver full time. Workers are n't bitter, <PERSON> Vaillancourt </PERSON> said. The mood in the plant, said <PERSON> Bourdeau </PERSON>, is mostly just disappointment. `` We have met our schedules and our quality has actually improved year over year for the last four or five years,'' conceded <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON>, the plant area manager. When the shutdown was announced in 1985, the 425 workers were n't covered by job-security provisions and compromises had to be sought Transfers were offered to almost every employee, and 160 took the jobs in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON> said. Job-training programs were offered and an early retirement plan, which begins at age 50 even if a worker gets laid off at a younger age, was also offered. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> had also worked out education and training programs, ranging from high school equivalency schooling to truck driving. The training programs took four to five years to get into place, <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON> said. `` You just ca n't do it in 60 days,'' said <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON>, in a reference to new federal legislation requiring 60 days' notice of an impending layoff or shutdown. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s climate control division in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, said the company has had a longstanding policy that approximately two years' advance notice is given before a plant closes, so the law does not affect the way <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> handles such situations. `` Let's face it, we do n't want to see the plant close,'' union leader <PERSON> Roti </PERSON> <PERSON> Roti </PERSON> said. `` But if there has to be a plant closing, this is the way to do it.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> officials today approved a proposed $ 221 million settlement in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> securities fraud case, and Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> recommended that the state pay $ 10 million toward the settlement. The settlement, subject to approval by 13 other utilities, was proposed by bondholders' lawyers to resolve a case inspired by the largest municipal bond default in history. The only utility that would remain as a defendant would be <ORGANIZATION> Snohomish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which contracted for the biggest share, 13 percent, on two <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> nuclear power plants. The trial was recessed last week in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, when attorneys reported a settlement was possible. It is scheduled to resume Wednesday. Construction was halted on two <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> nuclear plants in 1982 and <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> later defaulted on the $ 2.25 billion in bonds sold to finance construction of the plants, precipitating a flood of lawsuits. A class of more than 24,000 past and present bondholders and <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, a trustee for bondholders, claim the defendants conspired to lie and hide information that might have discouraged potential investors. In a resolution from the <ORGANIZATION> Tacoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the city utilities board, <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> agreed to pay $ 40.2 million as its share of the settlement. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Coates </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tacoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION>'s director of utilities, said the agreement was also contingent on federal approval of a $ 35 million payment from the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Bonneville, which backed financing of <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>'s three other nuclear power plants, markets power from federal dams in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, and is the region's largest power broker with an annual budget of $ 3 billion. In <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> today recommended that the state contribute $ 10 million in a lawsuit settlement. `` We believe that this will finally put the WPPSS issue behind us,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> said in a letter to state legislators. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state is not a defendant in the case on trial, but a settlement should end a separate lawsuit against the state involving the same plaintiffs, who are suing to recover $ 7.5 billion _ the $ 2.3 billion default plus interest. The proposed state involvement in the case would require approval of the Legislature. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> said they would ask for an appropriation in the supplemental budget when the lawmakers convene next January. The 13 other public utility districts involved in the settlement proposed by the bondholders were expected to vote soon on the proposal. Besides the utilities, remaining defendants include two engineering firms and a financial consulting firm. There has been no talk of settlement involving the professional firms, and attorneys with two of the firms said last week that no talks were going on involving their clients.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld on Monday an appeals court decision reviving a suit by stockholders who claim <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> hid its shaky financial condition to inflate the value of its stock. The high court refused without comment to hear an appeal of a decision by the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that a federal district judge dismissed the lawsuit without sufficient explanation. The 5th Circuit's ruling in June said that if U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Duplantier </PERSON> again dismisses the suit, he must explain why in detail so that appeal courts have something on which to base their review. Spokesman <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrera </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> did not have any immediate comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s action. <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, is an electric utility holding company that owns <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

The lawsuits claimed that Middle South deliberately withheld information from investors about its deteriorating financial condition. The stockholders said they were suing on behalf of anyone who bought stock between Dec. 7, 1982, and Aug. 16, 1985, a period of heavy trading. The company's troubles center on its $ 6 billion investment in nuclear power.

 The dollar ended mostly higher Monday in foreign exchange trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, as reported intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> lifted the dollar above its lows. Gold prices also rose. Dealers said the dollar fell on low volume in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, despite reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervened to push the dollar higher. Reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> bought dollars for yen twice during the European day pushed the dollar to its session highs before it drifted back. Dealers said the intervention succeeded in supporting the dollar for the day, but they said bearish sentiment toward the dollar is widespread. Several dealers said they felt the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> intervened on behalf of the Japanese central bank, and felt the intervention was not meant to turn market sentiment around. `` The intervention may be enough to steady the market for the week,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>, corporate advisor at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, `` but it was n't enough to turn around market sentiment.'' Bearish sentiment stems from disappointment that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit has not shown enough signs of improvement, while slower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth has disappointed those looking for higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, dealers said. Dealers said the dollar's movement Monday was accentuated by a thin market, since many corporate players have moved to the sidelines before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presdential elections next week, while markets in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> were closed Monday for a holiday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 1.08 Japanese yen to a closing 125.00 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it rose slightly to 125.45 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7678 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.7680 late Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.7810 West German marks, up from 1.7755; 1.4995 Swiss francs, up from 1.4970; 6.0800 French francs, up from 6.0750; 2.0000 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0010; 1,320.00 Italian lire, down from 1,321.50; and 1.2204 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2035.

<HEAD>Decline in Commercial Building Pushes Down New Contracts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New construction contracting fell 3 percent in September, pulled down by a decline in commerical and industrial projects, a business research concern reported Monday. It was the third consecutive monthly decline in total new construction starts, now valued at $ 238 billion on an annualized basis, according to the F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. All of the latest month's decline was concentrated in commercial and industrial projects, the report said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> economist, said continuing vacancies in commercial buildings and an overall reduction in public spending had reversed a five-year expansion of building activity. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> predicted the downward trend in new contracting would continue. `` Newly started construction is on its way to a 3 percent decline in 1988, with the prospect of a further dip next year,'' he said. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said a seasonally adjusted 7 percent dip in non-residential building in September seemed inconsistent with 1988's surge of manufacturing. Market fundamentals indicate industrial plant construction should be up sharply, given a capacity utilization of 84 percent in the nation's factories, he said. `` Instead, contracting so far in 1988 is running 10 percent behind last year,'' he said. Residential construction, meanwhile, remained at an annual rate of $ 115.7 billion in September, unchanged from the previous month, due in part to relatively stable mortgage interest rates. The value of contracts for non-building construction, such as public works and utilities, increased 1 percent to an annualized rate of $ 40.1 billion last month, the report said. An increase in highway and other public works construction was partially offset by a decline in utility projects. For the first nine months, new construction starts on an unadjusted basis totaled $ 191.7 billion, down 3 percent from the same period in 1987. The South has remained the weakest building sector in 1988, with 6 percent fewer construction starts than in 1987. The northeastern and north-central areas of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also showed declines, of 1 percent and 2 percent, respectivetly. Building in the nation's western region remained unchanged

Nine-month sales rose 11 percent to $ 12.1 billion from $ 10.9 billion a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> attributed the improved earnings to higher sales volume, lower levels of research, development and other new-business expenses, lower federal income-tax rates and increased income from other sources. Those items were partially offset by `` significant performance problems on several military aircraft programs,'' increased costs associated with commuter aircraft, and increased `` cost-share expenditures on government contracts.'' During the third quarter, 24 customers announced orders for 100 jet transports and 10 de Havilland turboprop commuter planes valued at $ 5.1 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said, compared with $ 3.8 billion in orders last year. For the first nine months of the year, 497 jetliners and 45 turboprop aircraft were ordered, valued at $ 23.1 billion. That compares with 267 jetliners and 40 turboprops, valued at $ 14.9 billion, in the first three quarters of 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said. Through Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s total announced 1988 orders stand at a record 560 jetliners, valued at about $ 25.8 billion. The latest order, also announced Monday, was <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maroc </ORGANIZATION>'s for 10 737 jetliners and options on 10 more.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> was dressed to play basketball Monday, but instead, he talked about breakfast cereal, posed with a picture of a cereal box almost as tall as he, and got down on one knee with an actual-size box in hand. Such was the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bulls </ORGANIZATION> star's inauguration as only the seventh `` celebrity athlete'' to be pictured on the front of packages of Wheaties, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> cereal marketed as `` The Breakfast of Champions.' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuckols </PERSON>, product manager, told reporters <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> was `` a man of real character and integrity,'' fitting for the positive image the product tries to have. `` I'm very happy to be part of the Wheaties organization,'' said <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, clad in his No. 23 Bulls jersey and black sweat pants. `` A lot of people would love to be in my shoes.'' Many might also want to have his bank account, which could swell with the Wheaties deal. But <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and company officials said that terms were not being disclosed. What they did disclose was that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s picture would be printed on at least 12 million to 14 million boxes of the cereal. Others who have contracted with Minneapolis-based General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> for the Wheaties limelight, beginning in 1956, include pole vaulter <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, decathlon star <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenner </PERSON>, gymnast <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Retton </PERSON>, baseball player <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, football's <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> and tennis star <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Evert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, now a clergyman in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, first adorned Wheaties boxes before <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> was born 25 years ago, and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> admits that as a child, he did n't know about the cereal. `` We had a big family,'' said the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native, and pennies had to be watched. `` We used to eat wheat puffs _ remember those in the big bags that could last ... through five or six kids? That's what we had.'' On the back of a series of Wheaties boxes will be installments of `` The <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>,'' tracing his roots from an awkward kid to pro basketball's Most Valuable Player last season. Actually, `` a dozen or two'' athletes have been pictured on the front of Wheaties boxes over the years, but <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> is only one of seven `` celebrity athletes'' to get the honor through major deals with the company, said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, public relations supervisor for General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Long-Distance Costs Have Risen, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Although most basic interstate telephone rates have remained unchanged since spring, extra charges for directory assistance and other adjustments have raised overall long-distance calling costs, according to a new survey of phone rates. The consumer survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit group that tracks long-distance rates for residential and business callers, found some carriers have reduced the number of free information calls and cut the hours of the cheapest calling period. `` Rates have n't been going down and there have been all sorts of adjustments that have been nibbling at the edges to maximize revenue from each subscriber,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a consultant to the center. `` This is a pattern we expect to see in the future,'' he added. Interstate long-distance rates are due for another round of reductions soon to reflect savings from a 60-cents-per-month increase in the line charge subscribers pay to help maintain the local phone network. The charge will be added to the existing $ 2.60 monthly line charge on Dec. 1. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has proposed to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that its rates drop by an average 3.8 percent to reflect the line-charge increase. AT & amp; T competitors do not have to cut their rates, but they often do to remain competitive with the industry leader. <ORGANIZATION> TRAC </ORGANIZATION>'s survey found increases ranging from 1 percent to 5 percent for most long-distance carriers since its last survey on March 31. Among the increases reflected in the group's rate-comparison chart were a reduction by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> in the number of free long-distance information calls from two to one and <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s increase in the cost of such calls from 55 cents to 58 cents, <ORGANIZATION> TRAC </ORGANIZATION> said. Also, <PERSON> Allnet </PERSON> has begun applying evening rates rather than the cheaper night-weekend rates to its Saturday night 5 p.m.-11 p.m. calling period, and the company is applying a 5 percent surcharge on callers using its equal access service if they do n't have an account with Allnet, <ORGANIZATION> TRAC </ORGANIZATION> said. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> raised its rates by about 5 percent since the last survey, <ORGANIZATION> TRAC </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> TRAC </ORGANIZATION> advises residential and business subscribers to re-evaluate their long-distance service periodically to see whether there are lower-cost alternatives. `` The problem is that consumers made their decision once, and have settled into one company and plan,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagenhauser </PERSON>, a TRAC lawyer who managed the survey. The <ORGANIZATION> TRAC </ORGANIZATION> survey compares the cost of long-distance monthly bills with 33, 123 and 303 interstate calls of a variety of distances. The cost of three long-distance directory assistance calls was also figured into the bills. For the 33-calls comparison, the cheapest plan was <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> standard rates at $ 33.60, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint 10333 and 10777 access rates at $ 34.20, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> standard rates and 10222 access at $ 34.88, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's Reach Out America Day Option at $ 35.09, and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's <ORGANIZATION> Reach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Out </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Option </ORGANIZATION> at $ 35.27. <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> standard rates were next at $ 35.37, followed by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's <ORGANIZATION> Reach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Out </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION>, $ 35.45; Allnet standard rates, $ 35.78; <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T standard rates and <ORGANIZATION> MidAmerican </ORGANIZATION> standard rates, $ 35.97; ITT 10488 access longer distance, $ 36.04; and Allnet 10444 access, $ 37.51. When a `` typical'' residential bill of 380 minutes was calculated with the bulk of the calls figured at night-weekend rates, the cheapest plan was <ORGANIZATION> MidAmerican </ORGANIZATION> standard rates, followed by Reach Out America Evening Option, <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> standard rates, Reach Out America Day Option and Sprint 10333 and 10777 access.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Urge Reagan To Continue Tariff on Canadian Shingles,
Shakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirteen Northwest lawmakers urged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday to maintain tariffs on cedar shakes and shingles imported from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> imposed almost 30 months ago. The lawmakers, in a letter to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said that dropping the duty rather than proceeding with plans to gradually phase it out `` would result in shake and shingle prices plummeting as Canadian imports pour in. `` We are confident that if relief -LRB- for the domestic industry -RRB- is continued for the full five-year period as you announced in May 1986, the industry will be able to meet Canadian competition head on without additional government assistance.'' In announcing the tariffs, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said they were necessary to allow the industry, mostly based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, to adjust to competition by modernizing mills and developing alternatives to traditional cedar shakes and shingles. The administration imposed a five-year program that called for a 35 percent tariff during the first 30 months, a 20 percent tariff between 30 months and 54 months and an 8 percent tariff for the final six months. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said it was his `` intention'' to maintain the tariffs for the entire period `` if general market conditions continue to warrant relief and if the domestic producers have begun to make reasonable progress toward adjustment during the first 30-month period.'' But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also asked the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to report to him on the `` probable economic effect'' on the domestic shake and shingle industry if all tariffs were removed after 30 months. The commission in early October was unable to reach agreement on whether to recommend a continuation of the tariff program as planned, with three commissioners voting to drop all tariffs immediately and three supporting thegradual phaseout originally envisioned. The lawmakers warned that unless the tariffs were maintained as planned `` it will cause extreme hardship on the industry.'' Many mill owners have purchased or ordered timber in anticipation of the continuation of the tariffs and thus have no way to reduce their costs to compete against cheaper Canadian products if the tariffs were dropped, the lawmakers said. Since the tariffs were imposed, the lawmakers said the Canadian share of the market has dropped from 73 percent to 59 percent, employment in the domestic industry is up 26 percent, wages up 39 percent, production up 41 percent and mill productivity up 12 percent. The letter was signed by Democratic Reps. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Copper Hits Record High; Demand Intensifies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices hit all-time highs Monday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as demand for tight supplies of the metal intensified On other markets, platinum futures surged while gold and silver were mixed; energy futures fell; grains and soybeans advanced; livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated. The thinly traded contract for November delivery of copper reached $ 1.4775 a pound, well above the 1 -LCB- - week-old record Comex high of $ 1.465, and settled at $ 1.4740, 2.95 cents higher than Friday's final price December copper finished at $ 1.4115, up 1.45 cents. Analysts said buying was prompted in part by the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s report of a 9,200-metric-ton drop in its warehouse supplies of copper last week. The market had expected a decline of 5,000 to 7,000 metric tons. Meanwhile, a miner's strike in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> ended its second week on Monday, increasing concerns that supply problems could persist into next year. `` The Peruvian situation is getting more critical every day,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, director of research with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Meanwhile user demand for copper in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remained `` very strong,'' dispelling any fears that last week's price decline signified a new trend in the market. `` We're seeing both supply and demand developments that are bullish for the market,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` We had a nice little technical consolidation last week and now it's roaring back on a very constructive set of fundamentals.'' Platinum futures posted strong gains on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, partly in response to news of an agreement among 12 Western European nations to strengthen their pollution restrictions, analysts said. Platinum is a key element in many automobile and industrial pollution-control systems. The Comex gold and silver markets were fairly quiet, reflecting the negative price impact of the stronger dollar and the weaker energy market, analysts said. Gold settled 20 cents lower to 20 cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 415.10 a troy ounce; silver was 1.3 cents to 1.4 cents higher with December at $ 6.348 a troy ounce. Platinum was $ 4.80 to $ 6.80 higher with January at $ 550.60 a troy ounce. Crude oil futures fell on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> following reports that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> was prepared to dump huge quantities of oil onto the market unless <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> put aside their differences and join other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members in an agreement to curb their oil exports, said <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, vice president of energy investments with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 27 cents to 43 cents lower with December at $ 13.58 a barrel; heating oil was .20 cent to .84 cent lower with November at 42.62 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.52 cents lower to .14 cent higher with November at 50.24 cents a gallon. Live cattle gained sharply in a technically inspired rally while feeder cattle were mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Hogs were mixed on spillover buying from the cattle pits and selling stemming from weaker cash markets, analysts said. Live cattle were unchanged to .77 cent higher with December at 74.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .22 cent higher with November at 82.02 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher with December at 41.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .07 cent to .48 cent lower with February at 46.52 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting positive chart signals and expectations of a rise in demand. Wheat settled 3 -RCB- cents to 5 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 4.15 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 3 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.82 \ a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 2 cents higher with December at $ 2.36 a bushel; soybeans were 5 \ cents lower to 8 -LCB- cents higher with November at $ 7.76 -LCB- a Stock-index futures fell modestly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 settled .45 point lower at 279.10.

 The dollar rose broadly in active <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading Monday after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> intervened and bought the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency to help increase its value. Gold prices were narrowly mixed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading after rising abroad. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 412.20 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down a nickel from its late Friday price. U.S.-based foreign exchange brokers said the dollar got a boost from significant purchases by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, in what appeared to be a message that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank wo n't let the currency fall below recent levels. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> sold Japanese yen and bought dollars,'' said <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a trader at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Julius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Swiss banking concern. `` They made clear they were in the market.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> does not comment on its currency-market activities, which are conducted via a select group of dealers. But word gets out quickly when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is buying or selling, either because dealers tell each other or because the size of a purchase or sale is so large it can only have been done by a large central bank. Currency strategists were divided over the dollar's longer-term trend. Many believe the dollar will decline despite central bank intervention if pessimism about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy intensifies. But others say the dollar already has declined significantly over the past few weeks and is due for a rebound. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chorek </PERSON>, a currency analyst at the commodities futures firm <ORGANIZATION> MMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said he believed the dollar would continue rising over the next few weeks, based on his calculations of supply and demand and other technical factors influencing its value. `` Overall to me, the dollar looks very good at this point,'' he said. `` It's moving up against everything.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 1.08 Japanese yen to 125.00 yen, but rose later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to 125.45 yen. By the time trading ended in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fetched 125.67 yen, up from 125.63 yen late Friday. The dollar strengthened against the British pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where sterling fetched $ 1.7678 vs. $ 1.7680 late Friday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound traded at $ 1.7684, weaker than its $ 1.7720 value late Friday. Other late-dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> vs. rates late Friday: 1.7873 West German marks, up from 1.7719; 1.5074 Swiss francs, up from 1.4937; 1.2247 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2037; 6.0913 French francs, up from 6.0525; and 1,328.25 Italian lire, up from 1,319.25.

The price being paid by the buyer, <ORGANIZATION> Basin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION>, represents 13 cents to 40 cents on every dollar of the government's investment, depending upon whose analysis is accepted The one-of-a-kind plant near <LOCATION> Beulah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, has been a technical success, producing an average of 142 million cubic feet a day of high-BTU synthetic natural gas for four interstate pipelines. Built for $ 2.1 billion, of which $ 1.5 billion was from loans guaranteed by the federal government, the plant and an associated mine passed into government ownership three years ago when its private operators defaulted on the loans. The government is still subsidizing four projects started by the defunct <ORGANIZATION> Synthetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fuels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Eight companies submitted bids for the plant. Basin, a wholesaler of electricity to rural electric cooperatives, won with a bid valued by the department at almost $ 600 million, a large part of which will be paid from future gas sales. This would represent 40 cents on the dollar of repaid loans. However, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said last week that the bid should be valued at $ 200 million _ still better than continuing to run the plant, an option <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said would yield a revenue stream worth the equivalent of $ 166 million in a lump sum today. The chief difference between the two bid values is $ 300 million in production tax credits granted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Basin </PERSON> has agreed to waive. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the Energy Department should not count the $ 300 million, but the department insists it is a legitimate benefit to the government. At a closing ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said, `` We fundamentally do not believe the government belongs in running the project. We believe that you, as businessmen in the community in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, have a better sense of how to run the business than we do in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> That's fundamental to the principles <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has brought to this government. <ORGANIZATION> Basin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was selected because, among other reasons, it offered the best chance to keep the plant running, <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McPhail </PERSON>, general manager of the cooperative, said, `` With this signing we feel it is on to bigger and better things for the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> Project, for <ORGANIZATION> Basin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and for the federal government.'' The sale contract provides that in certain circumstances of extremely low gas prices, <ORGANIZATION> Basin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> may return the plant to the government. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wampler </PERSON>, assistant secretary for fossil energy, said he did not expect the government ever to have to take over the plant again. `` I think the worst thing that could possibly happen would be the plant would be mothballed by Basin ... until prices rose,'' <PERSON> Wampler </PERSON> said.

 The stock market drifted to a mostly lower finish Monday in dull trading, as Wall Street recovered from last week's takeover frenzy and waited for new developments. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.24 points to 2,148.65. The blue-chip indicator remained slightly lower through most of the trading session. Declining issues edged out advances by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 835 issues down, 626 up and 496 unchanged. Stocks came under some pressure from an early decline in the dollar, but mostly just slipped under their own weight, analysts said. `` There's nothing around to stimulate it,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's all kinds of incentives to sit around on one's rear end and await developments.'' Many participants were said to be sidelined, awaiting Tuesday's meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s policymaking arm and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures for October, scheduled for release on Friday The fast-approaching presidential election also has dampened activity. Some observers expect the central bank's <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ meeting just a week before the election _ to decide to keep credit policy and interest rates stable. Recent signs that inflationary pressures are easing would make the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> loathe to push interest rates higher, and could even persuade it to lower them, some analysts believe. `` The thinking is there will be no need to raise interest rates,'' said <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. That view gained further credence Monday when <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION>, estimated that the nation's economy has slowed in the third quarter and will grow by 1 percent to 2 percent next <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that recent economic data have allayed fears of rekindled inflation. Stock prices got a brief boost in the afternoon from a rebound in the dollar, market watchers said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> came into the foreign-exchange market at least twice Monday to bolster the dollar by buying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency and selling Japanese yen, according to exchange dealers. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> totaled 143.46 million shares, down slightly from 146.30 million in last Friday's session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 170.60 million shares.

 Union workers at <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plants in five states have ratified a new three-year contract with the company by a 3-to-1 margin, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantyla </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said 73 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>'s 17,500 blue-collar workers approved the contract hammered out during nearly three months of negotiations at a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-area </LOCATION> hotel. `` We call it an overwhelming margin,'' <PERSON> Mantyla </PERSON> said. `` It's a higher margin than a lot of recent contracts, although it was n't as high as <PERSON> Deere </PERSON>'s recent contract, which got 90 percent approval. But we're pleased with it.'' Only the 222 members of Local 215 in <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, rejected the pact with 91 percent of the membership turning it down. Union leaders believe the pact `` meets the key goals that we set at the start of negotiations,'' <PERSON> Mantyla </PERSON> said. `` Greatly improved job and income security will be provided to UAW-Caterpillar workers under the new agreement,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Casstevens </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> secretary-treasurer. `` The pact addresses the unique needs of active and laid-off <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> workers, while meeting the economic pattern set by the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> for negotiations in the agricultural and heavy construction equipment industry.'' The contract talks came as Peoria-based <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, was building its best year since the company was formed in 1925 The company has reported two consecutive quarters of record sales, and record profits in the last three months. The contract calls for a wage increase of 3 percent the first year followed by 3 percent lump-sum bonuses in each of the last two years. It includes bonuses for night shift employees. It also gives 100 percent job security for 85 percent of the workforce, as well as gains in pension and early retirement benefits. Under the contract, which expires Sept. 30, 1991, <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a moratorium on any plant closings.

<HEAD>Illinois Says Deceptive Practices Used in Drought Insurance Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOWLING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> charged Monday that a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> used deceptive and unfair practices to sell so-called `` drought insurance'' to more than 1,000 Illinois farmers. Administrative charges filed by the department after a four-month investigation alleged nine separate violations of state law by the subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Federal sold insurance against inadequate rain _ a type of policy not authorized by state law _ to farmers who thought they were buying coverage for extensive drought-related crop losses, the department said `` Even if they had issued policies to every farmer who applied for and paid premium for this coverage, it could have meant a windfall for some farmers and provided no protection at all for others even if their comparative crop losses were identical,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Enoex </PERSON>, chief attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. State Insurance Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> said the charges, if proved, `` would demonstrate a shocking abuse of and disregard for <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> consumers and <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> insurance laws by a member company of an insurance group whose reputation, at least prior to this problem, had been considered to be among the best in the industry.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> officials had not seen the charges and so could not comment on them, said <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON>, a senior vice president of the group, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> scheduled a hearing on the charges Dec. 1 in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. If the charges are proved, <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> said, Federal could be required to pay $ 16.8 million in claims to 702 farmers, and also might face suspension or revocation of its insurance license. Insurance agents in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> advertised the insurance and accepted premiums in late spring, when many farmers already suspected that a dry growing season was in store. The state charged that Federal allowed farmers to assume they had received coverage after filing an application and paying a premium, but then began rejecting the applications nearly halfway through the three-month term of the policies. Federal also arbitrarily changed the amount of insurance it planned to make available in each of several different <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> regions `` whenever it seemed to fit their needs,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Enoex compared the company's offer of drought insurance last summer to `` offering to sell fire insurance to a person whose building is burning,'' and said Federal's subsequent decision not to offer policies was `` much like tossing gasoline on the fire.'' Federal has paid nearly $ 6 million in claims to 246 <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> farmers, and has made an additional $ 1.4 million in `` goodwill payments'' to 720 farmers who applied for but did n't receive coverage, the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Farmers from all over the country who paid premiums are party to a class-action lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> that seeks to force <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> to extend coverage to anyone who paid a premium and still wants the insurance. This past weekend, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> officials said they had reached a $ 5.25 million settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> and Federal over drought insurance sold to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> farmers last spring. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> said Federal paid out $ 20 million for drought claims in seven Midwestern states and another $ 11 million in goodwill payments top farmers who applied but did not receive coverage. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> said the 8,800 applications for $ 350 million in coverage far exceeded the $ 43 million in coverage it could provide.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Brown-Forman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced an agreement Monday under which the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> beermaker will bottle and distribute <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Cooler wine cooler in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> planned to begin blending and bottling <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Cooler at several of its facilities by March 1989, when <ORGANIZATION> Brown-Forman </ORGANIZATION> was to close its plant in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the companies said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Brown-Forman </ORGANIZATION> planned to grant <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> its exclusive license to produce and market <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Cooler in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> within 60 days, the statement said.

<HEAD>Chapter 11 Plan Accepted By Creditors, Shareholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Creditors and shareholders have voted to approve the reorganization of <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, the company announced Monday. The plan, which also has been confirmed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to be consummated in early December, subject to closing of the sales of the company's air filter and pump businesses, <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> said. The plan is based on distribution of proceeds from sales of major businesses of <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION>, which began as a farm machinery producer and branched out into a wide variety of manufactured goods, and on issuance of new common stock in the reorganized company. <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> in June announced an agreement to sell its pump business to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 71 million, and in April said it would sell its air quality control business for $ 245 million to <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> news release stated that between $ 400 million and $ 425 million of proceeds should be available for distribution, and unsecured creditors would recover about 17 percent to 22 percent of their claims. The company also said holders of Series C preferred stock would receive between $ 2.4 million and $ 3 million in cash distributions, depending on the level of proceeds, and 12 percent of common stock of the reorganized <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION>. It said existing common shareholders would receive no cash distributions and about 19 percent of the common stock in the reorganized company. The reorganization plan also provides for `` continuing lifetime health care benefits and death benefit coverage for retired employees at reduced levels secured by trust funds,'' the company said. Another provision will fund existing pension liabilities and applicable administrative costs. The reorganized <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> will have an office in the <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allis </LOCATION> and three wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, one a machinery repair facility in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and the other two involving alternative fuel technologies, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for Chapter 11 reorganization in June 1987 in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court for the southern district of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>HCC Rejects Ramada Restructuring Plan; Chain Posts 3rd Qtr. Profit
Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a holding company for the <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, reiterated its desire Monday to take over <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 378 million offer and said it was unimpressed by a Ramada restructuring plan. But the chairman of Phoenix-based Ramada responded that his company would continue to try to carry out the restructuring, which would include selling off its hotel and restaurant businesses and the distribution of at least $ 278 million to shareholders. Separately, Phoenix-based <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> reported that its third quarter net income declined by 9.5 percent from the same period last year, due to losses in its hotel and restaurant businesses. <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> posted net income of $ 3.9 million, or 10 cents per share, compared with $ 4.3 million, or 11 cents a share, for the third quarter of 1987. Revenue during the quarter rose to $ 141.2 million from $ 113.5 million in the year-earlier period. The <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family, which also owns Hyatt hotels and is <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON>'s largest shareholder with 7.2 percent of its stock, made its $ 10 a share cash buyout offer in September. <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors countered Oct. 20 with the restructuring plan. `` Not only was <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> not impressed by the Company's -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- restructuring plan ... but also the public's reaction ... has been unfavorable as evidenced by the market price per share of common stock,'' said <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> in a document filed Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> shares closed up 50 cents at $ 9.37 -LCB- a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In a Friday-dated letter sent to <LOCATION> Ramada </LOCATION>, detailed in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing under the name of <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Handelsman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> the restructuring plan did not give stockholders free rein to decide the company's future. It also called `` clearly unjustified'' any statement that the buyout proposal was inadequate. The <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> letter said its proposal would expire at 5 p.m., CST, Wednesday. `` Should the Company -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- fail to commence a dialogue with <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> by the time indicated, or should market or other conditions warrant, <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> will feel free to take such action as it deems appropriate under the circumstances,'' the letter stated. But Ramada Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> sent a letter Monday to <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> board chairman, reiterating <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION>'s desire to pursue the restructuring program. <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> said it was `` in the best interests of all Ramada stockholders.'' He also said Ramada would keep its gaming holdings under the plan, and said information about units to be sold would soon go out to stockholders. <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> owns <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Callender </PERSON>'s restaurants, and under its restructuring plan, it would retain gambling businesses including <ORGANIZATION> TropWorld </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tropicana </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. In its earnings report, <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> said the quarterly profit was hurt by $ 4.3 million in net losses from its hotel and restaurant businesses. Those losses in discontinued operations compare with 1987 third quarter losses of $ 2.9 million in the same areas. For the first nine months of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 4.4 million, or 11 cents per share, compared with $ 6.9 million, or 18 cents a share, through September of last year. Nine-month revenue rose to $ 352.9 million from $ 315.8 million a year earlier.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lubrizol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will receive an $ 80 million cash payment and $ 6 million in trade credits as part of the settlement of a patent infringement suit against an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, the firms said Monday. The settlement was reached between <ORGANIZATION> Lubrizol </ORGANIZATION>, which makes petroleum additives, and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Darien </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, according to a joint statment by the two companies.

Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> received a limited paid-up license for a replacement product it developed after a June court order barring it from selling the disputed lubricant additives. The consent order ended the suit filed in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> but did not affect other pending actions regarding the patents in other countries.

 Accounting giant <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it filed suit against <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, accusing the huge London-based advertising concern of trying to force <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> to sell at least part of its consulting business. The suit follows the departure last month of four top consulting partners of <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> for a new consulting venture backed by <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>, the world's largest advertising holding company, is becoming more deeply involved in a number of non-advertising businesses. The suit appears to resemble a number of other actions in recent months by advertising and law firms against former executives who strike out on their own in the same line of work with backing from their former company's competitors. In the suit filed in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Chicago-based <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> accuses the British firm and several former <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> executives of conspiring to coerce <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> to sell all or part of its management information consulting practice. It accused the defendants of raiding <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> personnel, interfering with <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> clients and misappropriating <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s confidential and proprietary technology and trade secrets Named in the suit with <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> are the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, formed in mid-October with <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> financial backing; <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Millar </PERSON>, a former top executive at <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> until his resignation in November 1986, and <PERSON> Gresham </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brebach </PERSON>, who headed <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> management consulting practice until he was relieved of his post last May. The suit accuses the individuals with breaching their duty of loyalty and their fiduciary duties to <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> and its partners. A call was placed to <LOCATION> Saatchi </LOCATION> headquarters after business hours, but a spokesman for the company was said to have left for the day. In addition to <PERSON> Brebach </PERSON>, the suit names former <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> executives <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> and accuses them of breaching fiduciary duties. Those four quit <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> on Oct. 14 to join Information Consulting. The complaint said <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>, proposed to buy <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s management information consulting practice in January 1985 but that the proposal was rejected. It said <PERSON> Millar </PERSON>, while still employed by <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, subsequently approached management with a plan to sell or spin off its management consulting practice, and his overture was rejected. <PERSON> Millar </PERSON> left <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> in 1986 to join <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>, and made additional overtures in 1987 about the <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> management consulting practice, but was told <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> had no plans to sell it, the statement said. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said it removed <PERSON> Brebach </PERSON> as head of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> management consulting practice in May 1988 after hearing that he had solicited other <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> partners in developing a business plan for an independent practice. The firm said <PERSON> Millar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brebach </PERSON> encouraged other <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> executives to leave and join Information Consulting.

 <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morrell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday sought a federal court injunction to block a record $ 4.33 million fine levied against the meatpacker on Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>, a subsidiary of Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, wants to stop the <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> action because the company believes it was unfairly singled out, said <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> Chairman <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schloss </PERSON>. `` If <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> continues to single out <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> and create a completely uneven playing field against our competition, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> could very well shut that plant down,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> contends the company knew about serious health hazards at its <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> plant but failed to protect its workers. The action filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, seeking an injunction against <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, contends there are no industry standards on how to prevent the repetitive motion injuries cited by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, and says <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>'s repeated requests for establishment of such standards have been ignored. The injuries cited by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> occur as a result of repreated hand, wrist and arm motion during work. The fine handed down Friday was the largest against a single employer in <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s 17-year history. <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> had 15 days to appeal the charges to teh separate federal <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schloss </PERSON> also questioned the timing of the fine, which comes just weeks before the Nov. 20 expiration date of the current three-year contract for workers at the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> plant. Negotiations are continuing on a new contract. The <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> plant employs about 2,000 workers. About 240 of them are union members who crossed the picket line during a sympathy strike last year. Another 410 are union members called back to work since the strike ended, and about 1,350 are replacement workers hired after the strike began.

<HEAD>Insurance Companies Will Pay $61 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four insurance companies have agreed to pay $ 55 million to federal bank regulators to settle a lawsuit stemming from the near-failure of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, a government attorney said Monday. A fifth insurance company also is expected to agree to pay $ 6 million, increasing the settlement to $ 61 million, according to <PERSON> Candace </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabri </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement settles a lawsuit originally filed by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> shareholders against the supervisors of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, former bank vice president. The suit claimed <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s superiors were negligent in failing to prevent him from buying risky loans from <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>. The insurance companies had policies covering various <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> executives and therefore were liable, Ms. <PERSON> Fabri </PERSON> said. Former bank Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> were among those named in the lawsuit. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> was accused of making risky loan deals that cost the bank millions of dollars and contributed to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to rescue <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> with a $ 4.5 billion bailout in 1984. Last summer, <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank funds and was sentenced to 3 -LCB- years in federal prison. He was accused by government prosecutors of accepting kickbacks disguised as personal, low-interest loans in exchange for arranging to have <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> take risky loans off <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>'s hands. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> vice president, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and was sentenced to 2 years. When the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> became the owner of 80 percent of the bank's stock as part of the rescue, it inherited the shareholder suit, said Ms. <PERSON> Fabri </PERSON>. Under the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 28 million; <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 15 million; <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 9 million; and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 3 million, Ms. <PERSON> Fabri </PERSON> said. A fifth company, <ORGANIZATION> CNA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to agree to the settlement and pay $ 6 million, she said. As part of the settlement, nearly $ 14 million will be given to people who held <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> stock from Sept. 1, 1981 through July 5, 1982.
