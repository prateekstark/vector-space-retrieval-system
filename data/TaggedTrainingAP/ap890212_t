 <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> said its troops killed 40 South African soldiers who crossed the border, violating a regional peace agreement, the Angolan news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The Marxist government protested to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> about the incident that also left seven Angolan soldiers dead, said the report monitored in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> government rejected the charge and requested an immediate meeting of a commission monitoring the peace accord to discuss the matter. The Angolan <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement issued Saturday said South African troops on Wednesday crossed into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> from neighboring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in support of Angolan rebels, <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Angolan government troops drove the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> back to the Namibian frontier after heavy fighting that ended early Friday, <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> reported.

In the statement Sunday, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said it was on standby to attend an urgent meeting of the monitoring commission in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, the Angolan capital, to discuss <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s allegations. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said last week it had no evidence that any South African troops entered <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. South African military authorities say their forces are strictly observing the U.S.-brokered peace agreement signed in December. The agreement bars South African military aid to the anti-Marxist rebels in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and calls for independence of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from South African control. The peace accord established a joint commission, comprised of South African, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and Angolan representatives, to monitor observance of the various provisions. As part of the peace agreement, about 50,000 Cuban troops were to withdraw from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where they have been helping the government fight the rebels belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The rebel group rejects the peace accords and has vowed to continue fighting until the Angolan government agrees to share power. The area where the fighting reportedly took place is near a stretch of the border between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> which does not have monitoring posts called for in the peace agreement. The rebels said Saturday that 275 government soldiers died in heavy fighting last week when 4,000 guerrillas clashed with the Angolan army in southern <LOCATION> Cuando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cubango </LOCATION> province. The rebels denied South African troops participated in the fighting.

<HEAD>Walesa Adviser Warns Followers Against Wildcat Strikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An adviser to Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> warned Sunday that the banned union would be blamed for wildcat strikes and called on supporters to show discipline and reject such actions. At a church frequented by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, an adviser to the Solidarity chief, suggested the strikes were provocations at a time when the union is trying to win status during its crucial talks with the government. The talks began Feb. 6. A strike at a steel mill in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has not received support from Solidarity or the government-sanctioned OPZZ trade union alliance. `` No one will claim responsibility for the currently organized strikes, not the OPZZ, not the left and not the right,'' <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> said. `` So again, Solidarity will be blamed. `` I understand that at this moment the life of the Polish family is very difficult. Today all the more so we are obliged to show a certain discipline,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> did not attend the Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> spoke and he did not authorize the statement, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and church officials said later. After the Mass, attended by 4,000 people, about 500 people staged a protest march to the train station. Demonstrators chanted `` Solidarity'' and `` Down with Communism'' and some threw stones at riot police shepherding the march toward the station. Police blocked the marchers and at one point charged them but did not use their riot truncheons. A strike at the <LOCATION> Laziska </LOCATION> steel mill in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that began Friday over wages also continued, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. A Solidarity spokeswoman said workers at the mill said their action was spontaneous and not led by any union. The state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news service Sunday reported the end of a three-day strike led by the <ORGANIZATION> OPZZ </ORGANIZATION> at two departments of the Marceli Nowotko steel plant in <LOCATION> Ostrowiec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Swietkrzyzskia </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Workers who had opposed the distribution of the plant's pay agreed to continue with the present pay system until May 15, when wages will be reevaluated, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. A strike over pay by transport workers in <LOCATION> Piotrkow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trybunalski </LOCATION>, a central Polish provincial city of 80,000 people, continued. The strike began Friday and is backed by the official trade union OPZZ.

In an interview to be aired Sunday on the network's `` 60 Minutes'' program, <PERSON> Bracy </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, told correspondent <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> that he was forced to sign a confession and that Naval investigators knew it was false. `` As I said, the things that they put in that statement that they accused me of doing I know never happened,'' <PERSON> Bracy </PERSON> said. The government had just uncovered a spy for sex scandal in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1987 when <PERSON> Bracy </PERSON> was interrogated. In the confession, which he later recanted, he admitted a sexual relationship with a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> cook at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 A federal judge has dismissed payola charges against a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-area </LOCATION> record promoter, saying the counts in the much-publicized <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation were too vague. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Rymer </PERSON>, in response to a defense motion, on Friday dismissed three misdemeanor payola counts against <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, on the grounds the grand jury indictment was n't specific enough to allow the promoter to defend himself. Court documents showed <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> was charged with `` making regular undisclosed payments or distributions of cocaine to program directors so the records he was promoting would be added to radio station play lists.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavin </PERSON>, a special attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said the government next week plans to charge <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> with 200 individual counts of payola. <PERSON> Stavin </PERSON> attributed the dismissal to a `` weakness in the payola statute'' that addresses only specific incidents and `` does n't contemplate a scheme or ongoing course of action. <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> and his wife are set to stand trial later this month on separate felony tax evasion charges stemming from the payola case. Reacting to the judge's ruling, <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooklier </PERSON>, said: `` The problem was, the government charged my client with multiple offenses over a long period of time without specifying the dates of those alleged offenses or the records involved.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> warned in a report published Saturday that opposition forces are resorting to `` psychological terror'' against socialists. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and party ideologist <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON>, maintaining a hard line against dissidents, made clear that the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> leadership is not prepared to listen to the Charter 77 human rights movement or other independent groups. Various groups try to rally `` as an opposition,'' and `` their actions are widely backed and assisted from the West,'' <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> was quoted Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency as saying. He alleged that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-funded Radio Free Europe and <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> `` and others directly participate in organizing -LRB- anti-socialist forces -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said foes of the system are moving from covert action to `` attempts at open confrontation, including psychological pressure, intimidation and even psychological terror against people who hold the positions of socialism.'' He apparently referred to 80 anonymous `` terrorist letters and calls'' the party daily Rude Pravo allegedly received, some of them reportedly wishing communist leaders to be hanged on lamp posts. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> also expressed the leadership's concern over a petition, signed by more than 1,000 prominent artists and intellectuals, calling for the release of jailed dissident and playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>. The party chief's toughly worded remarks contrasted with the official stands on nonconformists in neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Parliament last month approved formation of independent political groups and Polish authorities are negotiating with the outlawed Solidarity free trade union on trade union freedom and other reforms. `` We are not calling for dialogue with everybody, only with those who are willing to contribute to the solution of the problems of our society,'' <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` We wo n't have dialogue forced upon us by those who want to judge our problems from the positions of the defeated reaction in Feburary 1948'' when the communists took power. According to <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> lashed out at `` activities of illegal religious structures and of some church representatives -LRB- and -RRB- their efforts to misuse the religious feelings of part of the believers against socialism.'' Czechoslovak Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>, in recent letters to the regime, has sharply criticized police violence in breaking up peaceful demonstrations in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and called for a conciliatory official stance. Also, <PERSON> Jaroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Cejka </PERSON>, chief editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s cultural weekly <PERSON> Tvorba </PERSON> <PERSON> Cejka </PERSON> has been fired, apparently for criticizing a report on a meeting with cultural figures carried by the party daily Rude Pravo. Reporting on a Politburo session Friday, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Cejka </PERSON> was `` relieved of his post'' and `` was entrusted with other duties,'' a customary cliche for being dismissed. The surprising ouster came only two days after <PERSON> Cejka </PERSON> criticized Rude Pravo in <LOCATION> Tvorba </LOCATION> Wednesday for `` not doing a very good job'' covering a discussion between Politburo member <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> and a delegation of cultural figures.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of calls to the police and fire departments' 911 emergency number went unanswered Saturday because of a technical problem that knocked out the system for more than four hours. Authorities said they plan to investigate whether the outage, the first in the 911 system's five years of operation, resulted in injury, death or fire damage that could have been avoided had the system been working properly. `` At this point we just do n't know,'' said police Capt. <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewallen </PERSON>. `` I can say that this is a very serious problem. It is something that quite obviously we'll have to find remedies to ensure that it never happens again.'' The problems began at 1 p.m. when equipment that allows the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to transfer calls to the <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> stopped working, said <PERSON> Lissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanville </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the system. The equipment failure created a backlog that allowed only one in five calls to reach a 911 operator at the central communications center in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where all 911 calls within city limits are directed, she said. From 3 to 3:40 p.m., the system went down entirely and no calls got through. By 5:14 p.m., <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> technicians had the system working again, Ms. <PERSON> Zanville </PERSON> said. The number of calls that went unanswered was unknown, but the system normally handles 5,000 to 7,000 calls a day, and a four-hour breakdown would easily have left hundreds of calls unanswered, said <PERSON> Lewallen </PERSON>. Not all of those unanswered calls would be emergencies. <PERSON> Lewallen </PERSON> said that about 75 percent of the 4 million calls dialed each year on 911 are emergencies, with the rest usually non-emergency calls or pranks. The Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the county Fire Department, which do n't operate on the city's communications system, were unaffected by the outage, authorities said.

Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said 20 Iranian prisoners were freed to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Iranian revolution led by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. `` They're being released as a goodwill gesture toward the Iranian government,'' he told a news conference. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s highest-ranking diplomat in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Intizari </PERSON>, welcomed the release but said it will not improve relations. `` We are waiting for a government with the mujahedeen,'' he said. The prisoners appeared to be in good health, but many showed reporters scars and missing teeth and said they had been repeatedly beaten and tortured. The Afghan government had no immediate comment on the allegations. With the withdrawal deadline approaching, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> exhorted the Afghan people to protect their nation's sovereignty. `` Say in one voice: ` Country or death,''' he said. He also accused the Pakistani military of controlling the guerrillas. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, there appeared to be no end to the bitter disputes among guerrilla factions over the composition of a provisional Islamic government they want to form. At issue is how power would be shared by the seven insurgent groups in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the eight factions based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. On Friday, 526 guerrillas and other Afghans met as a council to decide the matter but the Iranian-based alliance walked out. <PERSON> Rasul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayyaf </PERSON>, the spokesman for the meeting, said Saturday the council would meet `` in two or three days.'' He said efforts to persuade the Iranian-based guerrillas not to boycott the council failed. `` We can not expect quick solutions to the problem of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he said at a news conference. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said patrols along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, the main route between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the Soviet border, were being discontinued. According to the report, the last motorized <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> unit traveled through a mountain pass on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>. It did not say how many troops or what kind of equipment were in the unit. The report also said a `` small group'' of soldiers will remain in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, to guard the airport until the Soviets complete a massive food airlift. A Soviet officer, Col. <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinokunov </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> the airlift will continue until Monday and his men will depart then. Col. Gen. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON>, the military chief of staff, has said the last Soviet soldier will leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Tuesday. Soviet officials have said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> contingent in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> numbered 115,000 before the pullout began May 15 and that half had left by Aug. 15.

<TEXT>
 Former Gov. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> began what he said could be a political comeback Saturday night by winning the previously obscure <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chair. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Westly </PERSON>, a party official unknown to the general public, 1,554-762, in voting by some 2,300 delegates at the party's annual convention. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s bid to return to the public arena overshadowed other events at the convention, including speeches by most of the major contenders for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1990 and the addresses of 1988 presidential hopefuls <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The two-time candidate for president picked the race as the vehicle to end the six-year, self-imposed political exile which began after he concluded his two terms as governor with a losing campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 50, once dubbed `` Gov. Moonbeam'' by his critics, spent part of that exile in seclusion writing in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, part working <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s hospital in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and part on a CARE hunger project in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> readily confirmed Friday that if he won the chair's office, he would probably seek higher offices in the future. But if he lost it would be the most embarrassing, and possibly the final, loss of his public career. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he was confident of victory in Saturday's vote. But his opponent, current vice chair <PERSON> Westly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, said he surveyed more than half of the voting delegates and found <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> leading by only 556 to 525 with 585 undecided. In speeches to the delegates Saturday, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> promised `` to mobilize the millions and millions of non-voters'' to rejoin the political process. `` You will not see my face on the cover of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Westly </PERSON>, 33, an investment banker and longtime party volunteer, told the delegates. `` But I have a different strength. I get the job done.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> wrapped up a three-month campaign for the post with endorsements from most of the state's most prominent Democratic politicians, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tem <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberti </PERSON>. But at least two dozen <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> officeholders and county chairmen publicly opposed <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, contending that his presence as official head of the party would breathe new life into Republican attacks against the most controversial events of his governship from 1975 through 1982 and be a liability for Democratic candidates in 1990. The bid for the obscure post of party chair by a former governor was unprecedented in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> politics, and it overshadowed all other business of the three-day <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> that started Friday. In an appearance Friday before the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> described his $ 150,000 campaign as his re-entry into politics and a possible stepping stone back to higher office. But he repeated his pledge that if elected he would n't seek any higher office until his term as chair is completed. `` I'm not running for anything in the next four years,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, adding that `` obviously, I do n't intend it to be my terminal position -LRB- in politics -RRB-. But where I go next, or where I'm invited to go next, will depend completely on the success of what I've embarked upon here.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that as chairman he would devote his full attention to party fund-raising, building local committees and clubs and party registration and get-out-the-the vote drives. He conceded that he often ignored the party while governor, and that the `` nuts-and-bolts'' administrative duties of state chair are exactly the things he tended to neglect as governor. But he said his priorities are different now. `` There has been a lot of discussion about my administrative ability. I've thought a lot about that over the last six years, and it's true ... a good manager -LRB- requires -RRB- doing things in a very structured manner, which is certainly not my natural inclination.'' He said changes in state laws giving the party more influence and the need to reverse declining voter participation trends to revitalize the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> all make the chair's job more important and challenging.

 Tamil rebels armed with automatic rifles, machetes and clubs attacked a remote jungle village in central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and killed 34 Sinhalese, authorities said Sunday. Elsewhere in the island nation, nine other people were killed as violence escalated with the approach of Wednesday's parliamentary election. One of the victims was an opposition party candidate, the 14th would-be legislator to die since campaigning started five weeks ago. More than 50 rebels crept into the village of <LOCATION> Dutuwewa </LOCATION> late Saturday night and surprised the sleeping residents, said a police officer contacted by telephone in nearby <LOCATION> Horawapatana </LOCATION>. Military officials in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said the victims included 20 children and five women. At least four people in the village survived by fleeing into the thick undergrowth, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Dutuwewa </PERSON> is about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the capital. The village is in predominantly <LOCATION> Sinhalese </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> but lies just outside <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, a main area of operations by Tamil separatists. A Foreign Ministry official in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> blamed the killings on the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful of the Tamil guerrilla groups that have been waging a bloody independence campaign since 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement denying responsibility for the attack. It was the second massacre of Sinhalese civilians in the region this month. On Feb. 3 at least 11 people were killed in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Amparai </LOCATION> district about 100 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Duduwewa </LOCATION>. More than 8,500 have died in the ethnic violence as the minority Tamils pressed their attacks on the Sinhalese majority and Sinhalese-dominated government. Tamils form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and live mostly in Northern and Eastern provinces. They claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population. In the south, parliamentary candidate <PERSON> Somapala </PERSON> <PERSON> Amarakeerthi </PERSON>, his brother and a supporter were killed Saturday by attackers wearing camouflage uniforms, military officials said. In the eastern town of <LOCATION> Sammanturai </LOCATION>, six supporters of President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were shot and killed by unknown attackers, the officials said

 Police opened fire Sunday on Moslem fundamentalists who stormed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government center in this city. Doctors said at least five people were killed and at least 30 were reported injured. The gunfire broke out when more than 2,000 fundamentalist protesters marched toward the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to demand banning of a novel, `` The Satanic Verses'' by <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Police repeatedly opened fire with rifles and semi-automatic weapons on the charging protesters, who hurled rocks and bricks in fierce fighting in the heart of the capital. Witnesses said the protesters ripped down the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag and tore shutters off the building. Protesters who broke into the building, which had been closed, smashed windows and started several small fires. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had no immediate word on damage. `` American dogs'' and `` God is great,'' the protesters screamed as they hurled rocks at the building and drove away scores of police trying to guard it. `` Hang <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>,'' one protester yelled. Doctors at area hospitals, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least five people were killed by police gunfire and many were injured. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s official news agency said 30 people were injured. Police kept the demonstrators at bay for almost an hour before they gathered strength and moved toward the center, which houses a library, a cultural center and the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. An unknown number of police were also injured by rocks, and some were beaten by the crowd. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and some <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations have banned the `` The Satanic Verses,'' which is named after verses the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> removed from the Koran _ the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> holy book _ on grounds they were inspired by the devil.

 Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Sunday accused South Korean troops of firing across the border at its policemen. The North's official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the firing `` gravely threatened the safety of the civilian policemen of our side on routine duty at the post.'' It did not mention any injuries or damage. `` It was entirely due to the patience and self-control of the civilian policemen of our side that this incident did not expand into an arms conflict between the two sides,'' said the agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. It said several <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> soldiers fired `` many bullets'' from automatic rifles Sunday afternoon from the Chosan military police post in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the two Koreas. The post is west of <LOCATION> Munsan </LOCATION>, a city about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and about 10 miles south of the truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> in the DMZ. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists and the South Korean puppets are committing one military provocation after another on the ground and in the sea while staging the adventurous ` Team Spirit 89' joint military maneuvers,'' the report said. `` This clearly shows how desperately they are making new war provocation moves to invade the northern half of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, bringing the situation of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain,'' it said. Team Spirit is an annual U.S.-South Korean joint military exercise, described as purely defensive. The North, however, says it is a rehearsal for invasion and has demanded it be canceled to improve the atmosphere for North-South talks. The two sides have held a number of contacts in recent months aimed at easing tensions and exploring ways to reunify the peninsula. The North and the South have been divided since 1945. They fought a bloody war in 1950-53 after the North invaded the South.

It also raises questions about how to respond to the more than 900 threats against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines each year, including when to warn the public. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials told two congressional committees last week that airlines have greatly increased security measures for foreign flights since the bombing of Flight 103. All checked baggage is X-rayed. Passengers are denied any access to baggage after check-in. Passengers are matched with bags to guard against unaccompanied baggage. Additional measures prevent unauthorized access to luggage or planes. And more passengers are subjected to random enhanced screening with suitcases actually opened by inspectors. `` We will not hesitate to tilt the balance toward improved security and away from convenience when that is necessary to protect our citizens,'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> told one of two congressional hearings last week. He indicated those measures and others _ which airlines will not discuss _ have brought little complaint. But airline officials and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> want the increased security imposed on foreign carriers flying into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers, estimates that 50 percent of international travel by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens is on foreign airlines. `` Beefing up security only for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers would be like having policemen patrol only odd numbered streets,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lally </PERSON>, association vice president for security. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> director for civil aviation security, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines are considered the major target for terrorists and that attempting to impose unilateral restrictions on foreign carriers could start `` an air war.'' But Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> hopes to reach a consensus on international security measures at this week's special meeting of the 33-member Council of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> called for the meeting to discuss steps to take following the Pan Am bombing. In addition to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inability to control foreign airlines and airports, authorities trying to combat terrorist attacks against airliners face weapons that X-rays ca n't detect and threats that often come from sources they ca n't identify. At least two devices are under development that can detect plastic explosives such as those investigators believe were planted in luggage aboard Flight 103. One is an explosive vapor detection system that checks people for explosives. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials say preliminary tests were conducted at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> but it is still in the testing stage. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has already tested and used two $ 1 million `` thermal neutron analysis'' machines at <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> airports and has ordered six more. Airline officials say the units should be sent right away to high-risk airports in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has identified 73 airports which it considers the most vulnerable to terrorism. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, has asked the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to determine how many machines would be needed for critical airports, how much they will cost and who ought to pay for them. In another congressional inquiry, Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairwoman of the Government Operations transportation subcommittee which plans hearings on Flight 103 next month, has asked the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to provide details of its procedures for warning of threats against aviation In letters last week to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> asked for documents relating to a telephone threat received by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> two weeks before Flight 103 was destroyed. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the threat was a hoax and no public warning was made, but a notice disclosing the threat was posted on the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> bulletin board eight days before the explosion. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the notice should not have been posted and said the government has a policy of not issuing such warning unless they are also made to the general public. He said if warnings were issued for every threat, it could cripple commercial aviation. But survivors of Flight 103 victims, in a statement last week, said passengers should be provided, on request, details of any threat against a flight they plan to take.

 Americans overwhelmingly support <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s overtures to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> but are deeply suspicious of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and dubious of its claim to have abandoned terrorism, according to a national poll Only 6 percent of those interviewed in the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey said they believed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s recent renunciation of terrorism, while 74 percent said the group just made that claim for political gain. The rest were unsure. Respondents were split on whether the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would coexist with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or sought to destroy it, and a strong majority said other groups could represent the Palestinian people. Still, the distrust was tempered by the desire for an end to the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> conflict. A majority said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, although most said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not force it to do so. The survey also found some frustration with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s support groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with 35 percent saying they had too much influence on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. Twenty percent said pro-Palestinan groups had too much influence. The poll was conducted among 1,162 adults Jan. 4-12, following <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statement recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renouncing terrorism. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejected the move as a ploy, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> responded by opening its first talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Sixty-seven percent approved of U.S.-PLO talks, with the rest split between disapproval and no opinion. Support was highest among college-educated Americans, with eight in 10 approving. Respondents, moreover, endorsed a major tenet of the Palestinian cause: Sixty-two percent said the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> should have their own country. Just 11 percent said no, and 27 percent had no opinion. Roughly a quarter of the respondents had no view on many of the questions posed, reflecting the distance of <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> issues from the daily concerns of many Americans. Significantly more men expressed opinions than did women. The most-educated respondents, those with post-graduate educations, were more likely to favor dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. While 62 percent overall said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, for example, that swelled to 79 percent of the most-educated group. Also, 60 percent of the most-educated group said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should allow the creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state on territory it now occupies in exchange for recognition from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Among all respondents, just 44 percent agreed. But the share of respondents who believed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has given up terrorism remained low in all groups, peaking at just 11 percent of the most-educated. One-third overall thought the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> wants to destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, about a third believed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would coexist with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and the last third were n't sure. More of the most-educated group, 55 percent, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would co-exist with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But six in 10 of that group, and five in 10 overall, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not recognize the Palestinian state the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declared in November. The rest were split between support for recognition and no opinion. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has said that it will not negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> because the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s charter calls for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s destruction, but that it would negotiate with other representatives of the Palestinians. Other Arab nations, however, have declared the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> the only legitimate representative of the Palestinians. In the survey, 63 percent said some group other than the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> could represent the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. And nearly seven respondents in 10 said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not try to force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> by threatening sanctions. The survey had a three-point margin of sampling error. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Tawanese Pilot Says He Planned Flight to China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The pilot of a Taiwanese fighter jet that crashed in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said on state-run television Sunday he had planned the flight, and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> newspapers claimed he carried military secrets to the communists. A local Chinese television station broadcast an interview with Lt. Col. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Xianshun </PERSON>, 35, who parachuted to safety Saturday morning 180 miles north of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, capital of southeastern <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> said he flew the F-5E jet fighter to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of his own free will. He also said none of his family knew about his plans. He did not elaborate. None of the Chinese reports made clear whether <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> requested asylum. In the past, the state media always have given prominent coverage to military defectors from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s nationally televised news said Sunday night that <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> had been `` warmly welcomed'' by officers from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s air force after his plane crashed into a rice paddy, reportedly after running out of oil. It showed <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>'s mangled jet and of <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> shaking hands with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> air force officers. It said he was treated in a hospital for slight injuries. Earlier reports from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> wanted to find his relatives in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> report said he had asked Chinese authorities to find an uncle, <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuyi </PERSON>. `` But authorities have yet to find the uncle,'' said an official at the state news agency in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, contacted by telephone from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, a relative of the pilot said he believed <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> defected to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to see his grandmother. The relative, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> complained that military officers were banned from visiting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In 1987, the Nationalist government eased a ban to allow all Taiwanese, except military and government personnel, to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources as saying <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> took `` several important documents'' about the strength of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s air force to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It said he took the documents from his squadron, which trained selected pilots as `` enemy forces'' during mock air battles. The mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> might reveal to the Chinese a military blueprint for the defense of eastern <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> from possible <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> attacks. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials refused comment on the reports. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s state broadcasting corporation reported authorities have taken <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>'s wife, daughter and son to Chihhang Air Base for questioning. More than a dozen Taiwanese air force officers have sought asylum in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and 19 Chinese military personnel have defected to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> since 1949 when the Nationalists lost a civil war to communist forces on the mainland.

<HEAD>Outspoken Former Congressman Gets His Chance To Attack Homeless Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Writing 10 years ago, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>'s programs `` are consistently misguided and scandalous.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who took over last week as the new secretary of that department, is getting his chance to improve those programs, or what survives of them after a decade of pressure on domestic spending. The former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman comes to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> at a time when the problems it deals with have gained heightened visibility. The nation's homeless population is growing and increasingly includes families unable to afford or obtain housing, according to surveys conducted by the nation's big-city mayors. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have both acknowledged the problem of homelessness. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who offered the harsh description of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in his 1979 book `` An American Renaissance,'' last month called homelessness `` a national tragedy of appalling proportions.'' He pledged new spending, and last week <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> included increases for emergency shelters in his new budget proposal. But both also have stressed that there are limits to what the federal government will attempt on homelessness and housing, and advocates of urban programs are watching <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> closely for evidence he will back up his enthusiastic talk about innovation and new ideas. `` He's not got a good record, but he has made very positive statements about homelessness lately, and he has recognized homelessness is a major scandal that has to be addressed,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Foscarinis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless. `` Now the question is, will he come through?'' she said. After a swearing-in ceremony by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s offices Monday, the new secretary plans to begin visiting inner cities, starting Tuesday with a trip to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> will lead him on a tour of housing projects and to meetings with public-housing tenants, including one at the Martin Luther King Jr.. Center, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s press secretary The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> visit is a logical one for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who frequently quotes the late civil rights leader the center if named after and actively sought black support as an unsuccessful rival to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. That outreach to blacks is a goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and, as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is in a position to aid that cause. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is a conservative Republican who speaks forcefully of empowering the poor by encouraging the creation of more private jobs rather than more federal spending. Urban advocates, some openly saying they want to educate him about the need for more federal spending, have invited him to visit other cities too. `` We're convinced that Mr. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> will change'' after seeing programs firsthand, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> and Redevelopment Officials. Although there is wide disagreement over just how many people are homeless in the country, urban advocates are convinced the problem is growing. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, in a survey of 27 major cities, concluded last month that the problem increased in nearly all those cities during 1988 and that in two-thirds of them people were turned away because shelters were full. The mayors also found that one in four homeless people were children. To deal with the emergency cases, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed $ 144 million in new spending in his fiscal 1990 budget, including full funding of the McKinney Act passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> providing temporary shelter. The budget, however, includes no money for additional units of subsidized permanent housing for low income people, beyond the level of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal. Spending for housing programs declined some 80 percent during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, and a dwindling supply of affordable housing is what mayors cite as the major cause for homelessness. `` Shelters are not the answer,'' <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. `` Permanent affordable housing _ that is the answer.'' Like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would rely heavily on use of housing vouchers, which are certificates for subsidy that renters use as partial payment of their rents. But critics say those do n't help a family find housing when no affordable units are available, and that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> virtually stopped subsidizing the construction of new affordable housing units. `` Vouchers work in some housing markets, but when the units are n't there, vouchers do n't get you anywhere,'' <PERSON> Foscarinis </PERSON> said. Her organization is backing a bill introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that would provide $ 2 billion to fix up vacant housing units and, backers say, eventually house 1 million people. So far, she says, the group is still waiting to hear from <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>.

 The prospect of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> shaking hands at their upcoming summit is causing surprisingly little anxiety in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Several years ago, reports of high-level chumminess between the two communist giants would have caused sleepless nights among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, wary of a renewed military and political pact between the powerful neighbors. But Asian and Soviet experts in and out of government say the relaxation of tensions between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, while not totally to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s advantage, could produce some positive steps in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region. `` Whatever concerns we might have had four years ago, had this come suddenly, have now been gradually reduced,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreisberg </PERSON>, a specialist in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> matters with the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. `` No one now expects the Soviets and the Chinese to restart the security alliance they had in the 1950s,'' <PERSON> Kreisberg </PERSON> said, pointing to comments from <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> that his moves toward easing tensions with the Soviets are not designed to damage U.S.-Chinese relations. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is to travel to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in May for the summit with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, marking the first top-level meetings between the two countries since <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Zedong </PERSON> in 1959. The sessions are designed to formally end the 30 years of hostility between the one-time rivals for leadership of the communist world and `` achieve a complete normalization of relations,'' Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> announced last week. `` There may be some Americans who are anxious about this,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kallgren </PERSON>, a director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Kallgren </PERSON> points to the rapid growth of the economic relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, arguing that there is little reason for the Chinese to disturb that trend. And the Sino-Soviet relationship `` has a long way to go'' to match it, she said. `` Are we beginning to see the kind of close -LRB- Chinese-Soviet -RRB- relationship that we saw 30 years ago? It seems to me that there are a lot of reasons why that analogy is a very limited value,'' she said. `` There has n't been much of a wringing of hands,'' agreed a senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who follows <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> affairs. `` We've had a chance to get used to this idea ... It's been coming for years.'' The official, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name, said the Soviet move to mend the ties that had been cut in 1960 began under former Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. The Chinese felt threatened by the Soviet-backed Vietnamese invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and the Soviet intrusion into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and the effort to improve the atmosphere did not revive until <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came into power. Needing to develop their economies, both nations have strong domestic reasons to alleviate tensions and reduce military forces along their 4,500-mile border. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is not alarmed by the upcoming summit, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official continued, because the two countries `` are not going to create a combined Sino-Soviet threat _ not a military one, not an economic one, not a political one.'' The Soviets also are meeting Chinese concerns with their withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and support for a Vietnamese withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Another positive result could be a lessening of tension on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, where the two powers have vied for influence with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, the experts point out. And by appearing to be less of a military threat in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, the Soviets are seeking to increase their economic and trade connections with nations enjoying the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> `` economic miracle,'' such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the Carnegie's <PERSON> Kreisberg </PERSON> said. Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> wrote recently that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might see `` more reason for hope than fear'' in the change. `` These two men ... have it in their power not only to end formally a long period of hostility but also to make an enormous contribution to peace,'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> wrote in a joint essay published by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Holbrooke </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> as an assistant secretary for east <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs when President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> established full diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may lose some of the advantage gained by having its own full diplomatic ties with two powers that did not speak formally to one another, they wrote that `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not fear the ending of its monopoly of the Big Three summit dialogue.'' Other experts note that since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has entered a phase of improved relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, it would be expected that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> forge better ties with its own neighbor. `` This brings a balance into the -LRB- three-way -RRB- relationship,'' said another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, a specialist in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs who also asked not to be quoted by name. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s upcoming trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ and his assertion that he is not deploying `` a <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> card'' by flaunting relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ demonstrates that the level of diplomacy among the three nations has reached a new plane. `` The need for each nation to play off one off another has markedly declined,'' the senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said.

<TEXT>
 As the last Soviet troops prepare to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a key question remains: Can the Afghan air force keep open <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s airport, the capital's vital link to the outside world? Col. <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinokunov </PERSON>, commander of a small Soviet guard detachment at the airport, has no doubts. `` The Afghan pilots have been trained in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and have continued to study here with us,'' said <PERSON> Vinokunov </PERSON>, who has been in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> more than two years. `` They'll be able to handle it, no worse than we did.'' His words should be put to the test this week, sometime before Wednesday, the deadine for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, a city of about 2 million, is surrounded by high mountain passes, which are relatively easy for the U.S.-backed rebels to block to cut the flow of goods to the capital. Winter snow and avalanches add to the problem of bringing in supplies. With no obvious end in sight to the 10-year-old civil war, the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport will be the key link to the rest of the world. The rebels are armed with sophisticated, heat-seeking missiles. The airport has not come under a rebel rocket attack in more than a month, and no airliner has been shot down over <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. But the threat has scared off all civilian aircraft except <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ariana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> and an occasional <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plane On Sunday, though, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> program to bring emergency supplies to the capital was interrupted when an <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet carrying the goods was ordered by the Ethiopian government not to fly in. Since early January, giant Soviet military transport planes have been airlifting daily hundreds of tons of flour to help ease food shortages in the capital. Helicopters circle the snow-covered mountains, searching for guerrillas and providing a screen of flares to deflect their heat-seeking missiles. `` We would like to give it all up right now and go home,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharenko </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>. `` But we'll finish the job. We'll help the Afghans. It's winter and things are rough. There's hunger in the city It's no secret.'' <PERSON> Vinokunov </PERSON> invited Western reporters to the airport to watch their operation and then to his quarters for tea, sausage, liver pate and vodka. The mujahedeen, as the Moslem rebels are called, say many in the air force are sympathetic to their cause and will not block the overthrow of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. Several Afghan pilots have defected to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which supports the rebels.

They have no way of being accurate,'' he said, standing with several <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> pilots next to a helicopter gunship. `` I like flying and I like to go out and meet them,'' said <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, nicknamed `` Eagle.'' `` I've seen these groups and wiped them out,'' he said as Soviet soldiers laughed and patted him on the back. `` I'm good at shooting them. Come for a ride with me and we'll find some to shoot at.'' The Soviet departure perhaps will have a psychological impact, but in practice, the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> air force already shepherds Afghan planes arriving in and leaving <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` Afraid of them? They are afraid of us,'' said <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>.

<HEAD>New Demo Leader Says Jackson Has ``Tremendous'' Leadership Qualities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, newly elected chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has the skills and capabilities to be a `` terrific national leader.'' However, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> avoided answering directly when asked whether he thought <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ whom he formerly served as an adviser _ was fit to be president. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a lawyer with a politically active <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> firm, was elected <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> chairman on Friday, becoming the first black to attain that post. Appearing on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said when questioned about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: `` I happen to think that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is one of the brightest, one of the quickest, one of the sharpest people that I have ever met or worked with. He certainly has tremendous leadership qualities and skills.'' Asked again whether he believes <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ who waged a vigorous but unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination last year _ is fit to be president, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> replied: `` I think he has the skills and the capabilities to be a terrific national leader. Now whether it's at the presidential level or at other levels, I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will have to decide.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has to define itself more clearly so that it will have a better chance of winning back white male voters in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and West who have voted Republican in recent presidential elections. `` I think if you asked the average voter in the'40s and'50s and'60s what a Democrat was, what a Democrat stood for, they'd be able to tell you. But in recent years we have allowed our opponents, our adversaries, our enemies to define us as a party,'' he said. `` You can not win when your opponents set the ground rules.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> added: `` I think once we start defining ourselves in a clear and concise and consistent way that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people understand, we're going to get back those voters. They're going to understand that the last thing we need in this country is two Republican Parties _ one is plenty enough.''

<HEAD>Computer Experts Fault FBI Plan to Track Suspects</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Plans to expand the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> crime computer to include tracking of suspects not charged with any crime pose serious problems for constitutional rights, says a panel of computer scientists. `` The files pose a potential threat to the privacy and civil liberties of persons included in the files and to the civil liberties of the public in general,'' said the report by <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professionals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION>. The report, prepared at the request of Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., was made public Sunday <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> is planning to hold hearings in March by his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> plans to update its crime computer. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> praised the computer organization's report and said the `` <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> should drop the tracking proposals.'' `` They pose too many problems in terms of security, privacy and accuracy, and it seems that the tracking proposals wo n't be very useful to law enforcement anyhow,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said in a statement. The tracking plan is part of larger blueprints to modernize the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> NCIC </ORGANIZATION>. Established in 1967, the <ORGANIZATION> NCIC </ORGANIZATION> has long been a focus of controversy involving issues of individual privacy. It consists of a main computer at <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters plus an array of telecommunications lines and a network of state and federal criminal information systems. Through this system, data is exchanged by more than 64,000 state, local and federal law enforcement agencies. It contains some 20 million records of wanted or missing persons, stolen property and criminal histories. According to the report, the <ORGANIZATION> NCIC </ORGANIZATION> system answers 750,000 inquiries a day and works almost instantaneously. Some police cruising in squad cars are able to query the computer through mobile terminals, the report said. It said the tracking proposals were part of an `` NCIC 2000'' blueprint for updating the system, prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> under contract by the <ORGANIZATION> MITRE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Under this plan, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would track individuals not subject to an arrest warrant but under investigation. If, for example, such a suspect arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from abroad, the system would be notified when he passed through Customs. The system itself would notify the law enforcement agency investigating the suspect. And if, on leaving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he drove south on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> and received a ticket for speeding, the process would be repeated. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NCIC </ORGANIZATION> is a valuable law enforcement tool,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` We should focus on making it better and more accurate but it should be limited to public record information, like warrants and stolen car reports. He said the agency should `` go slow in expanding the <ORGANIZATION> NCIC </ORGANIZATION>,'' adding that `` the experts who wrote this report found that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> still has not addressed the accuracy and reliability problems'' that critics say exist in the system. The study was prepared by three computer scientists, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horning </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Janlori </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s privacy and technology project.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is standing up for Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> and expects the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to confirm his nomination and clear him of allegations about his financial and personal affairs, White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said Sunday. `` Every single allegation that is of significance that has been checked has produced a dry hole,'' said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. Tower appeared headed for easy confirmation until conservative lobbyist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> testified before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 31 that he had seen the nominee intoxicated and accompanied by women other than his wife. Since then, allegations have mushroomed. A confirmation vote was delayed until at least Feb. 21 by a new allegation last week concerning Tower's campaign finances during his 24-year career in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., has said that he could not vote in favor of Tower until the allegations are cleared up <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> also expressed concern over Tower's drinking No date has been set for the committee to vote on the nomination. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is in the process of doing about the same thing we did before the name went up,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> interview program, `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>. `` We chased down through the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> all those allegations. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has to work its course. We understand that. That's the right thing to do But the President is convinced that the same thing will happen as they go through this, that those allegations will be proven not to have any basis and that when they do vote, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> will be confirmed,'' said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> denied that the administration had withheld from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators material developed on Tower by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` Every time the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has asked us for information, we have encouraged the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to provide it,'' he said. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> also said he did not think <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> was holding up the nomination in an effort to enhance his own power. `` I do n't think that's fair to <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, in response to a question. `` I've had a number of discussions, as has the president, with the chairman, and in each and every case, I think <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has put forward a very sincere set of concerns and concerns that ought to be followed to the fullest ... I think the senator's track record proves that he care about the defense of this country. We do n't have any problems with what is going on.'' Tower has testified that he does not have an alcohol problem, and authorized the release of a recent hospital test showing no evidence of alcohol abuse. Tower's designated spokesmen, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON>, said Tower sometimes drank too much in the early 1970's, but `` he's not had a drinking problem for years.''

<HEAD>Giving Chocolate On Valentine's Day More Than Romantic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The romantic effect of giving someone a heart-shaped box of chocolates on Valentine's Day could be more than sentimental. `` Chocolate does have amorous value,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a pastry chef instructor at the 8,000-student <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION>, one of the biggest cooking schools in the world. `` A chemical in the chocolate hits a pleasure center in the brain,'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said. `` As a gift from a lover to a lover, it would certainly help do the trick.'' Chocolate contains phenylethylamine, or PEA, a natural mood-altering chemical also found in the human brain. `` Win a lottery, get a promotion, fall in love, especially fall in love, and your PEA level shoots up. You're optimistic, sociable, and peppy,'' according to `` Chocolate, An Illustrated History'' by <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fredrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>. `` But if things go wrong, especially if something goes wrong in your love life, you turn listless and depressed because your PEA level is down.'' Cocoa butter melts at about body temperature, `` so when you put good chocolate in your mouth it begins to melt, it becomes a sensual thing,'' said <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinhart </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON>'s Chocolates in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, in a telephone interview from her store in <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. She said her sales are 20 times normal on Valentine's Day and the day before `` The taste of chocolate is a sensual pleasure in itself, existing in the same world as sex,'' sex therapist <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Westheimer </PERSON> wrote in her column, `` Ask Dr. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>.'' But there's also an argument against the romantic effects of chocolate. `` I really wonder whether giving chocolate for Valentine's Day is really the best type of gift if one wants to pursue any type of intense, romantic affair,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Wurtman </PERSON>, a research scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>'s department of nutrition and food sciences. `` The high fat and the high sugar content may make you very sleepy.'' `` If you're dealing in a situation where the woman is being pursued by the man, it might slow her down theoretically enough that she can be caught,'' she added. Whatever the real effect of chocolate, the origins of chocolate-giving on Valentine's Day are obscure. Centuries ago in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, chocolate was associated with divinities and so came to represent health and well-being, according to `` Chocolate.'' By the 18th century, chocolate's reputation as an aphrodisiac had spread over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, according to `` The Language of Sex from A to Z'' by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldenson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. It was `` probably the original alleged aphrodisiac of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>.'' Or maybe chocolate and valentines have a simpler relationship. `` I have a feeling that sweetheart goes with sweet,'' said <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansson </PERSON>, director of the pastry curriculum at <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. `` But for us, it's just hard work because it's a commercial day.''

<TEXT>
 The last time two respected black politicians in this town ran for the same office, things got downright ugly. That was in 1986, when civil rights movement veterans <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> spiked their 25-year friendship and fought each other for the congressional seat <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> eventually won. Now, <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s first black mayor, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> chairman, both want to move into City Hall as mayor when <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> moves out. Young is prohibited by law from running for a third consecutive term. <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, who has had designs on the mayor's office for at least two years, announced New Year's Day for the Oct. 3 non-partisan election. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has never ruled out another candidacy since he left office in 1981 because of the no-third-term law, is expected to announce his candidacy this week. Both insist the campaign will be polite and issue-oriented. History shows they may be wrong, and some sniping and stunting has already begun. `` We're all going to work hard and run a clean campaign,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` I do n't think it'll be dirty,'' <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> said. `` We all have to have opponents. I do n't view this with hostility.'' <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> political pollster <PERSON> Claibourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> disagreed. `` Without question, this will be a dirty race. They always end up that way,'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said. `` They always end up calling each other racists. You can count on that happening. `` This wo n't be an issue election; this will be a personality election,'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, 41, has served on the <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for 10 years, eight of them as chairman at a time when the northern part of the county, which encompasses predominantly black central <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, has undergone an economic and population boom. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 50, laid plans for the expansion of the city's airport and rail transit system. He also fought to see that a portion of the construction work on those projects would go to minority contractors. In the 1986 congressional battle, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> demanded that <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> submit to a drug test, and <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of abandoning black voters for the sake of white corporate interests. At one point, <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, `` I had to wait 25 years to find out you really do n't think I amount to much.'' The men were barely speaking to each other by the campaign's end. In this year's mayoral race, the issues are drugs and crime. The niceties already are being thrown out the window: _ <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> petitioned members of the <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to undergo drug tests. He submitted to one himself and passed. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> responded: `` If anyone wants to challenge me to a drug test, I'll meet them on the steps of City Hall, cup in hand. _ <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> scheduled vigils at the <ORGANIZATION> Bankhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courts </ORGANIZATION> housing project, where various services were suspended when postal carriers and telephone repairmen were chased away by the gunfire of drug dealers. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> showed up, and proposed eliminating the city's housing authority and turning the projects into tenant-owned cooperatives. He said cash rewards should be given to residents who turn in their drug-dealing neighbors _ funds the residents could use toward the purchase of their homes. _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke at a mid-January businessmen's luncheon in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s ritzy <LOCATION> Buckhead </LOCATION> section. <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> responded by accusing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of `` sleeping in <LOCATION> Buckhead </LOCATION>'' while he was `` camping out in <LOCATION> Bankhead </LOCATION>.'' _ When <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> announced his candidacy during a New Year's Day rally at another drug-ridden housing project, about 20 protesters, toting placards reading `` No <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> for Mayor,'' rained on his parade. Some in the <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> camp suspected <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces sent them. Protest organizer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yancy </PERSON> said they showed up on their own. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>'s newfound populist label `` is not going to be able to stick.'' `` What we've got is people who view public service in different ways,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I think one of the things that's going to come out of this campaign is a difference in the candidates as to how we look at and treat people.'' <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, who came from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the voters may not buy <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s image as a concerned native son. `` I understand that <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is a city which has a tremendous tradition of home-grown leadership,'' <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> said. `` But I think the issues have gone unaddressed in this city over the last 16 years.''

<HEAD>The Honeymoon's Over In Divided Indiana House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Three months after Republicans and Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> found themselves deadlocked at 50 members each and pledged to cooperate, their marriage of convenience is showing signs of strain. `` The honeymoon appears to be over, and the in-laws have moved in,'' is how House Republican Speaker <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannweiler </PERSON> put it recently. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> became bogged down in a series of disputes after Democrats began to exert their new power to block a 51-vote majority and Republicans showed frustration at losing control of the chamber for the first time in 12 years. `` It was strained, and there were times I think people were frustrated,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic floor leader. Both sides in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> pledged unprecedented bipartisan cooperation after Democrats picked up two seats in the November election, which also made <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> the state's first Democratic governor in 20 years, and the 100 seats split 50-50. After a deadlock on organization day in late November, negotiations finished on Thanksgiving yielded a unique power-sharing agreement. It called for co-speakers, one from each party presiding on alternate days; co-chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s 28 committees; and new rules designed to prevent one party from holding the other party's legislation hostage It seemed to work after the session opened Jan. 4, but events in the last couple of weeks demonstrated one party can still impose its will on the other. On a day when Democratic Speaker <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> was presiding, Democrats prevented a committee report on a Republican bill from moving to the amendment stage on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. Two days later, Democrats voted as a block to prevent a majority and defeat 40 Republican-written amendments to a bill to create a state lottery. `` I think obviously we've been shown that 50 united people can deny 50 other people the opportunity to have input,'' said <PERSON> Mannweiler </PERSON>. `` It's easy to take 50 votes and stop something. It's not so easy to get 51 votes and enact something,'' he said. During the debate on the committee report, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican Floor Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellinger </PERSON> argued that Democrats were stepping back from a tie-vote rule they had insisted upon during November's negotiations That rule allows a bill to emerge from committee on a tie vote. Previously, a bill had to have a majority vote to advance. <PERSON> Dellinger </PERSON> said blocking a committee report `` was like having a red flag in front of a bull.'' So, a few days later the lottery bill, which had been expected to enjoy broad bipartisan support, triggered a partisan debate.

<HEAD>Colombian Judge Kept In Hiding In Detroit, At U.S. Expense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge who fled <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> after being threatened by the alleged head of a major drug cartel is living in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, protected around the clock by guards paid by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported Sunday. <PERSON> Consuelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez-Duran </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON>, have lived in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area since October under the protection of about 70 guards hired by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified law enforcement officials as saying. It was unclear why federal officials chose the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area as <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>'s hiding place, but the <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said local police were concerned that her presence could endanger her neighbors or other people with whom she comes in contact. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, described by the paper as being in her 30s, fled <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> after issuing a murder charge against <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, who the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says is head of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, blamed for smuggling most of the cocaine that reaches the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A rival cartel is based in the Colombian city of <LOCATION> Calli </LOCATION>. The judge ordered <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> arrested and charged with murder in the Dec. 17, 1987, killing of <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, owner of the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>. Fifteen others also were charged. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, who has been reported to have financed low-income housing and parks in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, has not been tried. Members of the organization are suspected of carrying out dozens of murders in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The organization sent <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> a threatening letter before she signed the arrest warrant. The letter, published in Colombian newspapers in August, said that if she issued the warrant her entire family, including `` ancestors and offspring,'' would be killed. `` We are capable of executing you anywhere on this planet,'' the letter said. `` There is no place you can hide.'' Officials say <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> offered a $ 1 million murder contract for <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>. In four years, drug traffickers in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> have killed two dozen judges, a justice minister, an attorney general, three journalists and scores of policemen and soldiers. The News said that in the past seven years more than 50 Colombian judges have been killed. Officials told the News the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is paying the estimated $ 15,000 weekly security and living cost from $ 5 million provided by the 1988 Omnibus Drug Bill and earmarked for the protection of Colombian jurists who indict drug dealers. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> helped <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> leave <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, flew her to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and eventually brought her to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, according to the newspaper. Because the News learned and disclosed details about <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, the government is likely to move her, the newspaper said. `` They're going to have to change everything now that the cat's out of the bag, that's for sure,'' the newspaper quoted one federal official as saying <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> also is under federal indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on several charges, but is able to avoid extradition because <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> no longer recognizes its 1977 extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He was listed as a billionaire by Fortune magazine two years ago.

 High-altitude winds forced a postponement Sunday of the launch the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 space rocket with an advanced navigation satellite. The postponement was announced just 13 minutes before the planned liftoff after balloon data showed that shear winds several miles above the launch pad were too high for the rocket to pass through safely. `` We have scrubbed the launch of the Navstar mission because of the upper level wind conditions,'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> launch commentator reported. Wind velocities were not reported. The launch was rescheduled for 1:30 p.m. Tuesday. Rand said a two-day delay was needed to provide rest for the launch team. The maiden launch of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 is to carry into space a $ 65 million Navstar satellite that will enable <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> military users such as ships, planes, trucks and tanks to locate their positions within 50 feet. The accuracy for civilian users will be 300 feet. The Delta 2 is a more powerful model of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 1, which has logged 170 successes in 182 launches since 1960. It is the first of three new space boosters the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> ordered built to carry national security payloads after the space shuttle Challenger explosion in 1986. The grounding of the shuttle fleet and the Titan 34D rocket, also after a 1986 failure, has left the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> with a backlog of about 40 reconnaissance, communications, navigation and other military satellites to be launched. The new Titan 4 rocket is scheduled to debut here next month, with the <ORGANIZATION> Atlas </ORGANIZATION> 2 set for a 1990 maiden launch. The Navstar satellite, orbiting 11,000 miles up, is to join seven earlier model <PERSON> Navstars </PERSON> already on patrol. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> goal is a constellation of 21 of the upgraded payloads in orbit by 1992 to provide total global coverage.

 The prospect that <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> may soon die presents his successor, <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, with the unpalatable decision of whether to let him return home. It also has led to speculation about who will lead <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' followers upon his death The former president has been hospitalized in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since Jan. 16 and last week suffered a relapse of pneumonia and bronchial asthma. He remains in critical condition on a respirator in an intensive care unit. Supporters of the 71-year-old <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> say he is dying and wants to return to the country he ruled for 20 years until he was ousted in 1986 in a popular uprising. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has repeatedly banned <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from returning, citing security concerns, but she allowed a Filipino official to travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to talk with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> representatives. The decision suggested she might consider negotiating a deal, possibly involving the return of some of the estimated $ 10 billion <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates allegedly embezzled during his administration. Because the government's position is not entirely clear, rumors abound about an impending deal. There is lively debate among politicians and commentators on what Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> should do. `` National interest demands that we deny him a homecoming,'' wrote the independent Philippine Daily Inquirer. `` In sum ... <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, even in death, should not be allowed to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' But Senate President <PERSON> Jovito </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> should be allowed to come home to die if he can settle federal racketeering charges <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities filed against him in October. Even if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> dies abroad, the government would face the emotional question of whether to allow him to be buried in his native land. The administration has given mixed signals on the issue, and opinion among politicians and commentators is divided. Last week, several <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers quoted officials as saying the Cabinet has opted for a `` Napoleonic solution'': banning <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body from being returned to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> The phrase was coined by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Osmena </PERSON>, who recommended the government follow the example of <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>. The French emperor died in exile on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> island in 1821, and his body was not returned to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> until 19 years later. <PERSON> Osmena </PERSON> said the government would face mass demonstrations by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' followers and left-wing extremists if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body were brought to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> says the matter has not been settled. Forbidding a funeral here would infuriate <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters and risk portraying Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> as vengeful and unforgiving, especially since she refused <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' requests to return home in May after his 95-year-old mother died. `` Considering the fact that we Filipinos revere the dead and even forgive their misdeeds and wrongdoings while alive, a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> burial in his hometown should make <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> rise above the pettiness and recriminations of the people around her,'' wrote independent columnist <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurado </PERSON> in The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Standard. On Friday, Filipino news organizations received anonymous letters that said a coup called `` Operation Valentine'' would be staged around Valentine's Day, Wednesday. Military officers alleged to be part of the conspiracy included some of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s most trusted lieutenants. It appeared the letters were a right-wing attempt to sow distrust and to pressure Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> into acceding to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' demand to return home. She dismissed the letters as a prank. But military Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said three renegade officers, including former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, met recently in secret to discuss joining forces. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> led an August 1987 coup attempt in which 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded. Another question raised by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' poor health is who would lead his supporters should he die. Several candidates have emerged, including Vice President <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION>, who met <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> this month, and Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, whom Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> fired as defense minister in 1986 after a failed coup by his followers. Several politicians have pointed to <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>, a wealthy former <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ally who lives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON> is also a cousin of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` The figure to watch is really <PERSON> Danding </PERSON>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillego </PERSON>, calling <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON> by his nickname. `` People admire him because he did not bring his wealth out of the country and knows how to take care of his people.'' Former Labor Minister <PERSON> Blas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ople </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON> `` will be a serious competitor within the opposition for use of assets if he has a mind to use them.''

 At least 55 people were killed in the last two days of campaigning for legislative elections, including 36 villagers massacred while they slept, officials said Sunday. `` It is the worst and bloodiest election campaign in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s history,'' said <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gooneratne </PERSON>, a senior government official In the bloodiest attack, Tamil militants attacked the villagers in a remote jungle of central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Officials blamed militant Sinhalese for the other 19 slayings, including the assassination of an opposition party candidate. He was the 14th would-be legislator to die since campaigning for Wednesday's elections began five weeks ago. More than 1,000 people have been killed since nominations for the elections began Jan. 6. They will be the first parliamentary elections in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> since 1977. A 1982 referendum doubled the normal six-year life of the legislature elected in 1977. Campaigning ends midnight Sunday. Most of the 1,400 candidates for 225 parliamentary seats spent the day addressing meetings and making last-minute appeals for votes. The village massacre was perpetrated by more than 50 rebels, who crept into the rice-farming village of <LOCATION> Dutuwewa </LOCATION> and attacked with automatic rifle fire, clubs and machetes late Saturday, said a police officer contacted by telephone in nearby <LOCATION> Horawapatana </LOCATION>. Military officials in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said the 36 victims included 20 children. `` The rebels attacked a cluster of houses close to the jungle,'' according to the police officer, who said he was first to arrive at the scene. `` Other villagers heard shooting and screams but were too frightened to come out.'' <PERSON> Dutuwewa </PERSON> is about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the capital. The village is in the predominantly <LOCATION> Sinhalese </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, but lies just outside <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, a main operational area for Tamil separatists. Hundreds of army commandos and police fanned out in marshy jungles surrounding the village to search for the killers, while helicopters made aerial surveys to prevent the rebels escaping, the policeman said on condition of anonymity. A foreign ministry official in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> blamed the killings on the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful Tamil guerrilla group which has waged a bloody war for independence since 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement denying responsibility. More than 8,500 people have died in ethnic violence as minority Tamils press their attacks on the Sinhalese majority that dominates the government. Mainly Hindu Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people. They claim they are discriminated against in education, employment and culture by the majority <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>. In southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, attackers wearing camouflage uniforms killed <PERSON> Somapala </PERSON> <PERSON> Amarakeerthi </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, his brother <PERSON> David </PERSON>, and a supporter, military officials said. The killings happened Saturday in <LOCATION> Karandeniya </LOCATION>, 37 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Authorities blame most political killings in the south on Sinhalese extremists of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, who have vowed to disrupt the election. They accuse the government of making too many concessions to the Tamils. Among 16 political party supporters killed in a series of attacks across central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> were six Moslem supporters of President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> attacked while they were meeting to discuss election strategies, officials said. The other victims were Sinhalese.

 The White House budget chief said Sunday that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are free to propose new taxes, but insisted that more taxes are not needed to reduce the federal deficit. `` What would happen in a negotiation is that we are certainly not going to bring up taxes,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. `` The president has made his position extremely clear. `` If the other side wants to bring up taxes, we will have to discuss that on the merits.

President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned on a pledge not to raise taxes. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> was to discuss the administration's budget proposal Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget committees, Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` I look forward to learning a little bit more about what they're thinking of as their own possible budget,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said `` I've noticed some things that they've said which suggest to me, meaning no disrespect, that they perhaps have not yet fully read the book,'' a 193-page budget proposal that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his proposal would leave a deficit of $ 91.1 billion, well within the $ 100 billion required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. The Democratic chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal did not spell out how the government would ease the deficit. `` I do n't know whether we're going to increase taxes,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>. `` But I do know one thing, we ca n't increase them without the President of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said many details on revenue and spending were left to be worked out in negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Republican administration because `` if people take positions that are too sharp, too partisan, too publicly, it tends to prevent the system from coming together.'' Proposing new taxes, said <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, `` would be entirely up the Democracts, but I can assure you that I am not going to bring it up.'' `` I would think that the Democrats, I ca n't advise them, but I would think that they would not wish to be in that position. There is n't a need,'' he said. `` As soon as one opens the door for taxes, then the system loses discipline,'' said <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. `` What we need in this system now is discipline ... If you were suddenly to say, you know, we can duck this whole problem by just having a little tax increase, the next thing that happens is everybody starts saying, ` Well, we'd like to spend more on this, more on that, more on that,' and you do n't cut the deficit.''

 A comatose woman who received an abortion after a two-week legal battle was in guarded condition Sunday as her family explored moving her to a rehabilitation facility in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 32, was at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> Sunday, with all signs stable, a hospital spokesman said one day after Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> was given an abortion requested by her husband. She was 18 weeks pregnant. Attorneys involved in the case said the court's decision to allow <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brookville </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to order an abortion for his wife broke legal ground. `` It was a tough case because we did n't have a law to directly point to for an answer,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Auria </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> has been in a coma since she was severely brain damaged in a car accident Dec. 13. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, her husband of nine years, began court proceedings on Jan. 26 to become her guardian so he could order an abortion doctors said could aid her recovery. Abortion opponents challenged <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> from local courts to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, losing when Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> refused to issue a stay Friday. After overnight preparations, the abortion was performed Saturday morning _ as activists still tried to find a legal way to stop it. Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> will remain in the hospital while her husband and other family members research a rehabilitation facility where she can be placed. Under consideration are places in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> near where <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s sister lives and one in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area, family members said. `` I could n't bear to be that far away from <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said last week. One of the reasons <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> sought the abortion, he said, is that some rehabilitation facilities would not accept a pregnant woman. After the abortion was announced, anti-abortion activist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> vowed to press the appeal with the full <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, even though it is moot, to set a precedent so similar cases would not occur. But the ruling may have dealt a blow to opponents who have attempted to intervene in cases where they apparently have no clear-cut interest legally, some lawyers said. `` One of the important aspects of this case is that it is the first time a court has squarely said to these pro-life groups: It is inappropriate to interfere in the private decisions of a family,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, an assistant state attorney general whose office was called in to take part in the proceedings. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state appeals court, in dismissing an appeal from Short and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, another activist, called them `` absolute strangers'' who, `` whatever their motivation, have no place in the midst of a family tragedy.'' `` The importance of this case is that it establishes that the next of kin need only prove that the patient is incapable of forming an opinion or granting consent,'' said <PERSON> D'Auria </PERSON>. `` Under this ruling, it would be no longer necessary in the state for courts to weigh the relative risks or advantages, or even necessity, of an abortion.'' In issuing the first ruling in the case, <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> rejected the contention that this was a decision where there had to be clear and convincing evidence of what the woman's wishes would have been, before an abortion could be performed. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is a trial-level court. <PERSON> D'Auria </PERSON> said that father's rights also may have been furthered by the case. `` This case has marked a slight departure from previous existing law that stated that fathers do not have the right to determine whether a woman should have an abortion,'' <PERSON> D'Auria </PERSON> said.

 Nearly all Americans are aware of the crisis in the nation's savings and loan industry but only a small fraction are withdrawing their money, according to a poll released Sunday by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The telephone poll of 509 adults, conducted Feb. 8-9, found that 84 percent were aware of the crisis and that 49 percent had savings accounts in S & amp; L institutions.

A majority, 56 percent, said they approved in general of a plan by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to bail out the S & amp; Ls by selling bonds to supplement the federal insurance program that guarantees deposits in the instititions.

<TEXT>
 A Lebanese boy growing up amid the rubble of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has known little but war in his 14 years, but his vision of peace has been singled out in an international poster contest. The rendering of a dove emerging through shades of blue over a blooming red rose, drawn by <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tahoukji </PERSON>, captured the theme of the contest, `` Peace will help us grow,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON>, curator of 20th-century painting and sculpture at the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> and one of five judges. `` It just came as a stunner when we found out the winning poster came from a child who was witnessing the nightmarish reality that one associates with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for the last decade,'' <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> said Saturday. <PERSON> Tahoukji </PERSON> will receive $ 500 and a trip to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> with his family to receive an award March 13, <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> tried to call an affiliate in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> so officials there could tell the boy the good news, but the language barrier prevented much exchange, said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Lions officials planned to send a telex to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with more detailed information, but <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said the boy still may not have learned that his entry won. The contest, sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, examined entries from nearly 100,000 children in 49 countries. The 24 finalists' posters and <PERSON> Tahoukji </PERSON>'s winning entry, unveiled Friday, are on display at the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> through Feb. 28. The finalists will receive $ 100 and a certificate, <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said. It was the simplicity of the boy's poster, the shape of the dove's body, and the expression on its face that persuaded the judges to choose it over more abstract representations of peace. `` It's a difficult form of art because when one wants to reduce things down to essentials ... the risk is a one-liner,'' <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> said. `` He made it more complicated without throwing away the simplicity.'' The contest was designed to give young people an opportunity to think about peace and `` express it visually using their emotions and their talents,'' said Cannon. Many of the posters featured similar themes, which <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> attributes to the innocence of the participants _ ages 10 through 14 _ and increased communication among nations. `` There's something so uniform about the designs,'' he said. `` If this were done 30 years ago, I would think it would be really rather obvious that these were coming from different parts of the world.'' `` Obviously, doves were a common image, but another from <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> had a forest of trees growing in the night,'' he said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan to airlift emergency supplies to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was suspended after a second airline pulled out of the program, and it may be canceled, officials said Sunday. An Ethiopian airliner that made one flight to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> last week and unloaded 32 tons of wheat refused to go again, said <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanitarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The pilot of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 `` received instructions from -LRB- the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> government -RRB- that he should not proceed to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'' again, <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> told a news conference in the Pakistani capital. The instructions came as the crew prepared for their second emergency airlift Saturday, he said, adding, `` I'm not able to say if or when the next flight will be.'' Early last week, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> refused to fly into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, claiming security at the airport was inadequate. <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> then agreed to ferry the supplies. <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said he was trying to find out why the Ethiopians pulled out of the project. `` I can not speculate or extrapolate, -LRB- but -RRB- some people may be getting cold feet,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, he said, tried to keep a `` cool head and warm heart without getting cold feet.'' The airlift, originally expected to supply <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with 360 tons of food, medicine and blankets over two weeks, may be canceled, he said. `` Time is running out,'' <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had hoped to finish the airlift before Feb. 15, when the last of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has been hit by severe food and fuel shortages because of the bitter winter weather and blockades by Moslem rebels, who have been fighting the Soviet-backed government the past 10 years. <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> workers in the Afghan capital identified more than 30,000 people, mostly women, children and elderly, who were desperate for help. `` I've never seen a man in uniform starve,'' said <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been ferrying food into the capital also. <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> also said Sunday he has raised only $ 888 million of the $ 1.1 billion he needs for his `` Operation Salam'' project, which is designed to help <LOCATION> Afganistan </LOCATION>'s returning war refugees. <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said only 10 percent of what has been raised is in cash, and the rest is goods.

 Relatives of black prisoners staging a hunger strike prayed and wept Sunday at a church service held to support the strikers' demands for freedom. The service took place at Anglican church in the black township of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> a day after the government banned all public gatherings intended to show solidarity with the detainees. The service proceeded without interruption and there was no sign of security forces. About 300 detainees are involved in the hunger strike, including 105 at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Albans </LOCATION> prison in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> and about 170 at Diepkloof Prison outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Some of the prisoners have not eaten for 21 days, and lawyers say at least 13 of the Diepkloof hunger strikers have been hospitalized. Many of the detainees at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Albans </LOCATION> have been held without charge since mid-1986. They include several prominent anti-apartheid leaders who helped organize an effective black consumer boycott in 1985-86. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, a township bordering <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, about 400 people packed into <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stephens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> for the solidarity service. One of the organizers read a statement from the detainees which said: `` We wish to point out to our parents, wives, children and friends that we will not stop until we are home and free. Any attempt to stop us will fail.'' A civil rights lawyer, M.D. <PERSON> Vabaza </PERSON>, said he visited hunger strikes at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Albans </LOCATION> on Saturday and was told told that two of the detainees had collapsed in their cells, been taken to a hospital for treatment and then returned to the prison. The service was led by black and white clergymen, and the crowd included several dozen whites as well as relatives of detainees from throughout the region. The names of all the hunger strikers were read aloud during the service, which ended with the singing of `` God Bless <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' the anthem of the anti-apartheid movement.

 Volunteer firemen ran out of water fighting a house fire that killed eight people, and had to refill the water tanks on their trucks five miles away, authorities said. But officials said the fire spread so fast that more water probably would not have saved the lives of the eight family members who died in the blaze early Saturday. `` I do n't think water would have made much of a difference as far as lives,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> of the sheriff's office. `` The roof had already caved in when I got there at 3:40 a.m.,'' <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> said. `` It was engulfed in flames.

His wife, six of their children and a 2-year-old granddaughter were found dead in their beds in two bedrooms _ five in one and three in the other. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> was awakened by the fire and tried to wake his wife, <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON>, `` but she would n't move,'' said <LOCATION> Woodruff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Creasey </PERSON>. `` He was hysterical,'' the sheriff said. The fire, which authorities believe started from a crack in the chimney attached to a wood-burning stove used to heat the house, was reported by neighbors just after 3 a.m.. <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> said the four 500-gallon trucks from three volunteer fire departments responding to the blaze made five or more trips to fire hydrants in the Grays community, five miles away, to fill up their tanks The home in Revels, about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, was due to be connected to the public water supply in the spring, but was still relying on well water along with other homes in the rural community, according to Woodruff County Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Creasey </PERSON> identified the dead members of the <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>' family as <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON>, 46; <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON>, 25; <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, 30; <LOCATION> Kartarla </LOCATION>, 18; <ORGANIZATION> Belisha </ORGANIZATION> 14; <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 15; <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON>, 22; and <PERSON> Cortney </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, 2, daughter of <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>.

 The special prosecutor for the Iran-Contra affair credits the press with exposing the case and opening it to public scrutiny even if security blocks his case against former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> fails. `` There are two ways of enforcing the law,'' special prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told a group of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> broadcasters Saturday night. `` One is the old way of prosecution, which is long, expensive, cumbersome and sometimes has unforeseeable results. `` And the other way is by exposure and education, and that is what your profession does so well.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> lawyer, was in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> to be honored by the <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>. The chief justice of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday ordered a delay in the start of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial to give the full court a chance to consider a dispute over the possible disclosure of national secrets. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had ordered the trial to begin Monday, but <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys asked the high court for the delay based on claims that <PERSON> North </PERSON> could release highly classified documents during his defense. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> praised the media for its coverage of the Iran-Contra affair and the events leading up to the North trial, saying he was surprised how accurate the media reports were about information he later obtained in his own investigation. `` For six months, I got more out of the papers than I did from my entire staff,'' he said. But he said the irony of a strong, effective press is evident in the administration's request to forbid use of certain classified documents by <PERSON> North </PERSON> in his defense. `` The commitment to a public trial leads to the sometimes very difficult choices of whether certain information can be used at trial or whether certain charges must be dropped,'' he said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, 77, said he believes the trial should continue without further limitations placed on use of evidence, which could lead to the dismissal of some or all charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> if he is not allowed to use the information to defend himself. `` It's important to see if we can apply the law to all people, all levels of government, and to all activities, whether they are open or secret; and at the same time, preserve our obligation for a public trial,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, was appointed special prosecutor Dec. 19, 1986, by a panel of three federal judges.

 A former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressman who helped launch balloons bearing offers of a $ 2.4 million reward for the release of American prisoners of war said Sunday he is confident the balloons will reach <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendon </PERSON>, 44, said he and relatives of three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen missing from the war released 600 to 700 balloons from a trawler 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and 375 miles off the Vietnamese coast over the weekend. `` Our balloons will stay up 36 hours and I feel confident some will land in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hendon </PERSON> said in an interview.

 The first Episcopal woman bishop preached a Sunday sermon that mixed evangelical zeal with a call to social activism, saying that if <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders had faltered amid controversy she would not have been consecrated. `` We live in a word that oppresses, that dehumanizes, that is replete with injustices and exploitation, a world God did not intend,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> in a sermon at the <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>. `` If <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> had not taken risks, we would not be saved,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said a day after her consecration drew worldwide attention. `` If the diocese of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> had decided to play it safe, I would not be here wearing a brochet and a chimere and a pectoral cross.'' She received a standing ovation from most of the 400 worshipers, but one <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, couple left the church with the wife in tears, saying she was `` heartbroken'' by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' consecration. The couple declined to give their name. In a sermon that discussed the temptation of Christ in a modern context, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> called on the congregation to resist the temptation to shut their eyes to issues such as racism and AIDS. `` Under the guise of tradition and convention, we temporize with oppression and compromise with injustice,'' she said. `` We avoid the problem and the responsibility for becoming involved, and we rationalize to ourselves, ` There's no harm in walking with the devil as long as he's going your way.''' The mood was upbeat in the church. `` I felt like I was out of my body,'' said <PERSON> Delois </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who came from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to watch her friend of 15 years be consecrated this weekend. `` It was like the dream I did n't dare dream had come true.'' Also at the sermon was <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> Tim-Oi <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, the first woman ever to be ordained as an Episcopal priest. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was ordained in 1944 in war-torn <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> so she could give communion to those in <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> while the city was under Japanese siege. But two years later, under pressure from other Anglican churches, she agreed not to continue being a practicing priest though she did not renounce her ordination. `` I am very, very happy,'' said <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, now 81 and living in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` I am yellow. She is black. It breaks down the barriers. ... God creates boys and girls, two sexes. Now this makes God's will realized.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> predicted that the new bishop's warmth would sustain her. As <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> entered the church Sunday morning, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said, `` I said to her, ` Come here, let me kiss the bishop's ring.' And she said, ` Forget the ring, sweetie, kiss the bishop!'''

 The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> on Sunday said their <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour demonstrates the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to take a more active role in bringing peace to the region. During a press conference at the end of a seven-hour visit to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said that despite all efforts, he could not predict that 1989 could see the start of the peace process. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON>, accompanied by Greek Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carolos </PERSON> <PERSON> Papoulias </PERSON> and their French counterpart, <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, met earlier with President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>. They flew in from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> Sunday morning and flew on to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> after their press conference.

This visit to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> takes place within a framework of contacts with all parties concerned. `` We emphasize the necessity of the early convening of an international peace conference ... we have three objectives: first, to exchange points of view with the main parties in the conflict. Second, to contribute to push forward the peace process, and third, to assess the situation in order to consider further steps to be taken eventually.'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said both the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> believed that the early convening of an international peace conference was the best way to bring peace to the region.

<HEAD>Hospital Sues To Dishcharge Elderly Woman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A hospital has filed suit to evict a 70-year-old patient who refuses to be discharged in a dispute over whether she needs medical attention after more than 13 months there. `` I have serious questions about the way they are handling this discharge,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Olimpi </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Elderly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neighborhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think anybody can order her to go anyplace she does n't want to go since she has been judged competent,'' he said <PERSON> Olimpi </PERSON> told the hospital he will represent the patient, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosentino </PERSON>, in the dispute. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>'s lawsuit, filed Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, claims <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosentino </PERSON> no longer needs medical attention, said hospital attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedele </PERSON>. The hospital is trying to force her to be transferred to a county nuring home, to her home or to a relative's home. <PERSON> Fedele </PERSON> said the hospital will ask the court on Monday to set a date for a hearing in the dispute. The hospital is seeking a court order to discharge the woman. The state Medicaid program paid much of Miss <PERSON> Cosentino </PERSON>'s $ 250,000 hospital bill. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> officials say $ 90,000 in care has been provided for free since Medicaid discontinued payments in September. Medicaid acted because <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> said the woman no longer needed hospital care. The woman and her family claim she needs continuing medical attention because of recurring infections. Miss <PERSON> Cosentino </PERSON> has been a patient at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> continuously since Christmas Day 1987. She was admitted complaining of fever and chills. For all but a few days of her stay, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosentino </PERSON> has been isolated from other patients because of recurring staph infections which her doctor, <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, says she got at the hospital. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> says <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosentino </PERSON> is clear of active infection and would receive adequate care at the nursing home. By refusing to leave, she is denying scarce hospital space to people who are ill, he said. Miss <PERSON> Cosentino </PERSON> and her family question why she remains in isolation, where she was as late as Friday night, if <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> doctors are correct when they say she is no longer contagious. The family also contends doctors treated the infections with an antibiotic to which Miss <PERSON> Cosentino </PERSON> is allergic. The hospital's lawsuit claims Miss <PERSON> Cosentino </PERSON> originally agreed to be discharged, but changed her mind on the advice of her relatives.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, as played by <PERSON> Estelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> in `` The Unguided Missile,'' is a quirky, opinionated woman far shrewder than her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, at foreseeing the post-Watergate downfall. Miss <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> does a formidable job. She has the look of <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, in a floral dress with a superfluous ruffle, the stridency and the Southern accent. Through it all comes a woman of charm, warmth, spirit and brains, a free spirit believing it's a free country. In the play by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON>, which opened Sunday at the off-Broadway American Place Theater, Mrs. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> does such uncharming things as get drunk and rant that liberals should be run out of the country. She also discerns post-Watergate events shrewdly while her husband, the attorney general. Thinking himself vastly smarter than his wife, he tells her that he'll be loyal to President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and that the president will protect him. Her husband calls her a bigot, says he loves her for it and calls her an unguided missile because of her unpredictability. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>, playing <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, is convincing when he is proclaiming love for and frustration with his wife. He's less convincing when he proclaims how powerful he is, seeming more at home in a later scene where he admits that he was summoned to the White House but kept sitting around and never met with the president. The play begins the day of the Watergate break-in in 1972, with Mrs. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> kept a prisoner in her home by a man who says he's <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> He gives her pills and drinks, has a doctor give her a shot and keeps her away from the phone. When <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> returns home five days later, one hand is bandaged and the other arm in a sling. Later, she tells reporters she has proof the president ordered the break-in, while her husband is testifying that he did n't even tell the president about it. An angry <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> tells her that even her daughter hates her. In a final scene, in a hospital bed, Mrs. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> blithely relies on the reporter she often telephoned at night -LRB- <PERSON> Lezlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> -RRB- to do something about her money having run out. One is left less with an analysis of political events than with a multi-faceted portrait of a woman at a time of crisis. Miss <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>' portrayal gains a viewer's sympathy and even respect for <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> The play was commissioned in 1984 and has since been rewritten. It is being performed more than 12 years after <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s death <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> died last fall. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolo </PERSON> directed. <PERSON> Holger </PERSON> designed the set and lighting, and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Heineman </PERSON> designed what is seen on TV monitors above the stage. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Searcy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> all play several minor characters.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on Sunday denied <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s charge that her army is preparing to invade that country, saying <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has enough problems of its own without `` foreign adventures.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> stopped short of ruling out an eventual confederation with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> withdraws the last of the Soviet troops, which have been backing the government of Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in its war with Moslem guerrillas. `` Let's see what the Afghan people decide for themselves,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> told a news conference on the second day of a visit intended mainly to emphasize Chinese-Pakistani ties. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who uses only one name, alleged Saturday that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was massing troops along their common border in preparation for an invasion. He accused Afghan guerrillas of having agreed to link the country in a confederation with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in return for Pakistani arms and money. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> denied <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was moving troops to the border and said it would be naive for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to try to annex <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We've got enough problems of national integration,'' she said. `` We do n't need foreign adventures.'' `` People sometimes propose a confederation with one neighbor or another,'' she added. `` Stray ideas like this ... may have come up in the past in relation to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. I do not know because they have not gathered the weight to be considered by anybody.'' She said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> made his accusations `` in a bid to divert attention from the real problems'' he faces. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, both the foreign and defense ministries called <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s allegations `` preposterous.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, on her first official trip abroad since her election in November, met for 3 -LCB- hours Sunday morning with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and had lunch with former Chinese President <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON>. She was scheduled to meet in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> on Monday with senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. The 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for several weeks, and there are rumors he is undergoing medical treatment. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Saturday, said the talks with <PERSON> Li </PERSON> were useful and productive and `` enabled us to establish a rapport.'' They covered bilateral ties, international affairs, the two countries' economies, trade and communications, she said, adding, `` We agreed on everything.'' Asked about a <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> newspaper report that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has agreed to buy 75 more fighter jets from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said only that she did not discuss planes with the Chinese. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> long has bought most of its planes and tanks from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said officials of the two countries signed agreements to encourage and protect mutual investment and extend a trade protocol to 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said she invited <PERSON> Li </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and he responded that he'd like to visit this year. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have had close ties since 1950, when they established diplomatic relations.

<TEXT>
 Former Gov. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a two-time Democratic presidential hopeful, says it feels good to be back in politics after ending six years of self-imposed political exile with election to a party job. `` It feels very good. It feels great. It's been six years, but it feels like six months,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told reporters after he won the chairmanship of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democratic Party. He defeated investment banker <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Westly </PERSON>, a longtime volunteer unknown outside of party circles, by 1,591 votes to 777 in balloting late Saturday among delegates to the state party's annual convention. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who dropped out of public view after ending his eight-year tenure as governor ended in a losing race for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to Republican <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> in 1982, described the race for the unpaid party post as his re-entry into politics. He said he hopes to run for other, unspecified public offices in the future. But the 50-year-old two-term governor, who launched his first presidential campaign at age 36, pledged that he would devote himself to rebuilding the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and would n't seek any other public office during his four-year term as state party chairman Saturday's vote was <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s first election victory in over a decade. Since winning his second term as governor in 1978, he lost a series of presidential primaries in 1980 and then was defeated for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. Asked by reporters if he might run for president or the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> again someday, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> replied that `` those are the kinds of intentions that lie deep in one's heart.'' <PERSON> Westly </PERSON> had argued that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> would be `` a lightning rod for political criticism,'' breathing new life into Republican attacks against controversial events of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s tenure as governor, such as his appointment of unpopular former Chief Justice Rose Bird. Other critics said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s notoriously chaotic administrative style did n't suit the detail-oriented duties of a state chairman, and questioned <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s new interest in a formal party structure that he frequently shunned or ridiculed as irrelevant when he was governor. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> acknowledged all of those criticisms, alternately joking about his reputation and seriously promising that he has reflected on both his successes and failure during the six years he has spent out of the public eye writing, meditating and traveling around the world. `` I can become the media dark hole that absorbs all the negative feedback and allows our candidate for governor to go on to victory unscathed,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in an acceptance speech. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he is seriously devoted to `` the nuts and bolts of party work,'' laying out an agenda that ranged from redefining Democratic constituencies to operational goals ranging from the revival of nearly dormant local <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> clubs which thrived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the 1950s to new technologies in communications and fundraising.

 Pravda told its Soviet readers on Sunday that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> believes the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> economies are doing so poorly that they will fall further behind the West for another two decades. In a short answer to a reader's question, the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> did not lie when it reported the pessimistic economic projections given by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Henning </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON>. But Pravda said the conclusions in the report were `` on <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON>'s conscience.'' Pravda summarized the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> report, saying it projected no more than 2 percent economic growth per year and a widening economic gap between East and West until well into the next century. `` The system's deficiencies are so obvious that -LRB- the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -RRB- has no choice but to continue reforms. This significantly reduces its opportunities to use national funds for military affairs,'' Pravda said in explaining <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON>'s stand.

 Cardinal <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> on Sunday officially took over leadership of the powerful <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> archdiocese as thousands of protesters rallied against the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION>'s strict stand on birth control. <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON>'s appointment and the Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s conservative policies have caused a widening rift between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholics and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in recent months. Several thousand people jammed the square outside the massive <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> cathedral. One group held up a banner that read `` End the Papal Dictatorship'' as <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> arrived by limousine for a Mass marking the assumption of his duties. Other signs welcomed the new archbishop and he was given a standing ovation when he entered the packed church. The hourlong ceremony was broadcast live by the national <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network. <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> church leaders were angered last year when the pope insisted on the appointment of <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON>, an East German who was previously bishop of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Many Cologne church leaders felt <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> was too conservative and expressed displeasure that their wishes were not considered in naming a replacement for the late Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeffner </PERSON>, who died in October 1987. The <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> archdiocese is one of the most influential in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and one of the richest in the world. The delay in a new appointment also led to a clash between state leaders and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Under a 1929 agreement, local clerics and governments are given a say in the selection process. In his sermon to the congregation on Sunday, <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> sought reconciliation with those who opposed his appointment, but also clearly reaffirmed a conservative course that goes to the heart of divisions between West German Catholics and the pope's policies. `` My hand is outstretched to all for whom I carry responsibility,'' <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> said. `` I ask all to return this gesture so that we may work together to fulfill the Lord's task.'' But <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> also warned against the perils of adopting secular impulses and straying from church teachings. `` The task of the church is not to align itself to the -LRB- changing -RRB- spirit of the times,'' <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> said. Referring to the controversy over his appointment, <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> said: `` Continued public assignment of blame on this or other addresses will not serve the future path of the Cologne church.'' The issue of <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON>'s appointment has become part of a larger dispute in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> policies in recent months. In late January, a group of 170 <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> theologians released a declaration strongly criticizing <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and the church ban on artificial birth control. The document, called the Cologne Declaration, complained that the pope recently has linked the church's teachings on birth control too closely to fundamental articles of faith such as the holiness of God.

 Soviet soldiers on Sunday handed over their last outpost as they prepared to return home and leave the Afghan army to defend the capital against Moslem guerrillas. The Soviet-backed Afghan government, meanwhile, renewed its offer to negotiate with the guerrillas, whose moderate and hardline fundamentalist factions remained divided over how to form an interim government. During a heavy snowstorm Sunday, Soviet troops turned over their last combat outpost, on the edge of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport. Afghan soldiers raised their nation's red, black and green flag, and Soviet and Afghan troops cheered as the changeover was completed. The Afghans arrived with luggage, blankets and other personal belongings as well as automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. The airport, the capital's key link to the outside world, has been a frequent target of guerrilla rocket attacks but has not been hit in more than a month. A Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said that weather permitting, the remaining 300 Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> would leave Tuesday, a day ahead of the deadline set by a U.N.-sponsored accord to end nine years of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention. The last soldiers were guarding <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport while the Soviets completed a food airlift to the capital which the guerrillas, supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, are expected to besiege when the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is gone. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> airlift of food, medicine and blankets was suspended Sunday after <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> pulled out of the program, officials said. An Ethiopian airliner made one flight to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, unloaded 32 tons of wheat and refused to return to the city, said <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanitarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` I'm not able to say if or when the next flight will be,'' <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The guerrillas have been fighting the government in a civil war that began in 1978 when the communists seized power in a coup. On Saturday, Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of massing troops along the border to invade and then annex <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> on Sunday dismissed the allegation, saying her nation had enough problems of its own without `` foreign adventures.'' `` Let's see what the Afghan people decide for themselves,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on the second day of a visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. At a briefing Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said a government declaration renewed a 2-year-old offer to negotiate with guerrilla commanders inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` All countries are using <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for their own benefit. We ask them -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- not to be tools of others but to bring peace to the homeland and to help end the bloodshed,'' <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said. More than 1 million people have died in the war and hundreds of thousands have fled to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, the leader of a moderate Afghan guerrilla faction warned Sunday it may boycott talks on forming an interim government because of disputes with fundamentalists over including Iran-based <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. The Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance is mainly Sunni Moslem. <PERSON> Zabihullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, charged that hardline fundamentalists within the guerrilla alliance were plotting to discredit moderate groups, but he did not elaborate. Guerrilla sources said private talks continued Sunday. A council called to form a government met briefly Friday before disputes between the rival guerrilla factions stalled progress. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s population, meanwhile, has grown to more than 2 million because of refugees from outlying areas seeking food and shelter, and the city is facing a severe food shortage. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said he was trying to find out why the Ethiopians pulled out of the airlift. Last week, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> Air refused to fly into the embattled city, saying security at the airport was inadequate. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> airlift originally was expected to supply <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with 360 tons of supplies and was to be completed by Wednesday. <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> denied reports in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> cut a deal with the guerrillas to allow airlifts to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in exchange for food distribution in guerrilla-held areas.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wrapping up a weekend visit to his seaside retreat, worshipped Sunday in a country church where he and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, were welcomed as `` our old friends.'' He also met with a group of scholars on U.S.-Soviet relations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invited the academics to his family vacation home to join him and foreign policy aides for wide-ranging talks, according to spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the two-hour session `` open-ended, and not designed to focus on any particular facet of East-West relations.'' `` The president is always interested in hearing diverse views on public policy issues,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` It was just an intellectual exercise.'' Neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor the members of the group were available to speak to reporters afterward. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has delayed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in the next scheduled round of arms control talks with the Soviets pending what he has said will be a thorough review of the current state of U.S.-Soviet relations. At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has stressed _ both in his inaugural address and in his speech last Thursday to a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ his desire to work more closely with the Democratic-led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on foreign policy issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated the same theme of closer consultation with lawmakers and increased bipartisan in a meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday with leaders of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> foreign relations committees, according to participants. Earlier, the Bushes joined about 60 other worshipers for regular morning services at <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Although they are <PERSON> Episcopalian </PERSON>, the Bushes often attend the tiny, white clapboard church on the outskirts of this southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> seacoast village. The Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Howes </PERSON> stepped down from his pulpit to personally address the Bushes, who were seated in a front-row pew. `` Mr. president and our first lady, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. You know, I am sure, how warmly we welcome you, how much it means to us to have you a member of our congregation.'' He voiced `` confidence in your wisdom and integrity'' and added: `` This is the only time I will address you formally. You are <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, our old friends. And we are glad that you are home with us.'' The congregation applauded. After the service, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wearing an overcoat, stood outside the snow-coated church in below-freezing but sunny weather and said, `` was n't that a sweet service?.'' He shouted a greeting to a group of youths sitting on a fence, and shook hands with fellow church-goers. He also told reporters he was completely over a cold that had dogged him for two weeks and said he planned to `` take it easy'' most of the rest of the day. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invited the group of scholars, most of them from the region, on short notice. Among those invited were two <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professors: <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulam </PERSON>, professor of Russian history and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, associate director of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s Russian Research Center. Also invited were <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, senior research fellow at the liberal-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, associate professor of political science at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfaltzgraff </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of foreign policy analysis at the <ORGANIZATION> Fletcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> and Diplomacy. With <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were National Security Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, deputy secretary of state-designate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday, with a breakfast speech to a business group in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, along the way. Aides said the Bushes spent much of the weekend unpacking boxes of personal belongings that had been in the vice presidential residence in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and for which there was no room at the White House. The three-story gray shingle and stone home on a point jutting out into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> is the only home the Bushes own. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also spent several hours each day working in a small cottage on the compound that he has designated as an office. And he and his wife took time to enjoy a video tape, the movie `` Three Men and a Baby,'' aides said.

 About 40 Jewish settlers protested stonings and bombings with a sit-in at a Palestinian mayor's office Sunday, and five Arabs were injured in clashes with soldiers, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The protest underscored increasing settler vigilantism that this month included angry rampages into <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> towns and stoning of Arab cars. `` Me and my friends decided we should get the message across to <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> and the mayor that we have lost our patience,'' settler <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Katan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> after the group barged into Mayor <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneineh </PERSON>'s office in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>. The settlers warned <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneineh </PERSON> they would riot if he did not stop Palestinians from stoning and firebombing their cars which pass through <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> to and from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Katan </PERSON>, council head in <PERSON> Alfe </PERSON> <PERSON> Menashe </PERSON> settlement, said the settlers wanted to talk with <PERSON> Sneineh </PERSON> `` in a good atmosphere.'' But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said soldiers spirited the mayor out of the office before talks could take place. A military officer forced the settlers out of the office about three hours later, the reports said. Meanwhile, two left-wing members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter to Attorney General <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Harish </PERSON>, claiming the sit-in in <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> was part of a well-planned strategy by a newly created settlers' militia of `` a few hundred'' members. The letter signed by <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, a fellow member of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, said the mayor of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settement of Ariel, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachman </PERSON>, is one of the militia's leaders <PERSON> Nachman </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> no such militia existed. The daily Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that children from <LOCATION> Kedumim </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Karnei </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> settlements, both near <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, have begun stoning Arabs from their school buses in response to the attacks. Also in <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, soldiers Sunday warned six families that their homes will be demolished after a resident in each house was arrested on suspicion of helping firebomb Israeli targets, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. <ORGANIZATION> Bamahane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> reported plans to pave roads through <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> refugee camps to make it easier to chase rioters. Similar roads built during anti-guerrilla raids in the 1970s stirred considerable controversy because many Palestinians were forced from their homes. Among five Palestinians wounded in the occupied territories Sunday was a 22-year-old <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> man shot in the head, Arab hospital officials said. At least 380 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed in the uprising, which began Dec. 8, 1987. A 70-year-old man from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Shati refugee camp was in danger of losing an eye after it was it by a rubber bullet, the Arab hospital officials said. The army described the man's injury as slight. In a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, about 50 Arab youths marched, chanted slogans and handed out leaflets urging Palestinians to boycott Israeli products and not pay taxes. Also Sunday, a Palestinian human rights group said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report released last week fails to go far enough in criticizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s tactics to quell the uprising. Law in the Service of Man, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> affiliate of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurists </ORGANIZATION>, applauded the report but said it was `` at times seriously understated.'' For example, the group claimed 5,500 Palestinians have been detained at one time, while the American report put the greatest number detained at any time at 2,600. The report said five Palestinians have died in detention since Dec. 10, and the group said 10 have died.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has moved toward sharing power with other political groups by becoming the first Eastern European country to endorse a multiparty system. Party leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> announced after a two-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the policy-making body had decided a multiparty system was the only way to guarantee political pluralism in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. He also indicated the party had revised its view of the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt to acknowledge the uprising started with good intentions but went sour. A multiparty system would `` certainly provide an opportunity for alliances'' and participation by groups the Communists would not be able to mobilize on their own, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said in an interview excerpted on Hungarian radio late Saturday and due for full broadcast Sunday evening. The system is expected to be legal under a new constitution to be written next year. A communique from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> stressed that the transition to a multi-party system must be `` gradual and steady,'' to avoid what it termed `` the danger of the process becoming destabilized and uncontrollable. `` That is not in the interest of any force with a sense of responsibility,'' said the communique released by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said he expected the constitution to require new parties to operate `` on a socialist basis.'' `` If they do not accept the constitution, then they can not operate legally,'' he said, without elaborating. No date has been announced for multiparty local or national parliamentary elections, but both are due by the end of 1990. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s remarks indicated that dozens of political movements, many of which began in recent months, will be allowed to participate. Unlike alternative parties in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s groups are independent of the Communists. A new pro-Marxist group with an anti-Stalinist platform was founded Saturday. Another group, named after a leader of the national peasants' party crushed in the Communist takeover in 1948, announced plans to form a party calling for individual land ownership. Hungarians from the alternative groups and Western diplomats saw <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s statement as a victory for <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> reformers. They include Politburo member <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, who two weeks ago presented a startling reassessment of the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said the revolt was a popular uprising, not a counterrevolution as it has been officially called for 32 years. The comment triggered enormous public debate. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> indicated the committee had reached a compromise on the official view of the 1956 revolt. He said it started as an uprising in which many `` honest people'' fought against a dated regime, but ended with `` counterrevolutionary elements'' gradually gaining strength. During the past 30 years the official view had become distorted, and `` we forgot those popular elements,'' he said. Many party conservatives owe their jobs to supporting the idea that the revolt was a counterrevolution justly crushed by the Soviet military. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> led the revolt against the regime of the Stalinist <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakosi </PERSON>. It started Oct. 23, 1956, and was brought to a bloody end Nov. 4 of that year. In a statement to <PERSON> Vasarnapi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirek </PERSON>, the nation's Sunday newspaper, party spokesman <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON> said the initial uprising took `` the form of the intention to establish ` democratic socialism.''' Before the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> session opened Friday, 15 political groups issued a statement saying they could not cooperate with the Communist government unless the party changed its stand on 1956. <PERSON> Ferenc </PERSON> <PERSON> Koeszeg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> said the party's apparently revised stand seemed `` an attempt to find a compromise It's little for us, certainly, but it's the beginning of a process.'' The re-evaluation of 1956 and the emergence of alternative political groups have come at a time of increasing dissatisfaction over <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s stagnant economy and austerity measures. During the weekend, the government announced the third round of price increases this year, raising the cost of canned and preserved goods by up to 30 percent. The official trade unions have publicly broken with the government over price increases and have demanded an immediate increase in the minimum wage, now about $ 70 a month.

 The governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, under attack for a stock scandal and a new sales tax, suffered a setback in a closely watched special parliamentary election on Sunday. In the race for a seat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s upper house, Socialist <PERSON> Sadao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchigami </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Kei </PERSON> <PERSON> Oma </PERSON> of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s party, according to election officials in southern <LOCATION> Fukuoka </LOCATION> prefecture. In celebrations televised by the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fuchigami </PERSON> told his supporters: `` The people's complaints against the -LRB- stock -RRB- scandal and consumer tax led to my victory.'' <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said his party will call for the resignation of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s Cabinet, dissolution of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s more powerful lower house and a general election, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s secretary-general, <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, promised his party would accept the election outcome and go to work on reforms to restore public confidence. Sunday's election was the first involving a national office since the stock scandal surfaced last summer and since <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed a 3 percent sales tax in December. The stock scandal has led to the resignations of three members of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s Cabinet and more than a dozen other prominent politicians and businessmen. It also has raised questions about influence peddling. The election was seen as a possible indicator of what might happen in July when elections are held for half the seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s upper house. Liberal Democrats now hold 143 of the 251 seats. Severe setbacks in the elections would endanger <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s chances of winning another two-year term as party president and prime minister next October Sunday's special election was for the seat held by a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> who died in December. With all the votes counted by late Sunday night, the election committee said <PERSON> Fuchigami </PERSON> garnered 751,036 votes against 564,301 for Oma, 170,778 for <PERSON> Tatsuzen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujino </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and 160,294 for <PERSON> Kozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> of the Salaried Workers' New Party. <PERSON> Fuchigami </PERSON>, 51, is vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Fukuoka </LOCATION> prefectural branch An estimated 48.6 percent of the 3.4 million eligible voters cast ballots Sunday, compared with 74.5 percent in the previous upper house election in 1986 and 56.8 percent in 1983. The 1986 turnout was high because the election was held with one in the more powerful lower house. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current Parliament session opened Friday. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told lawmakers that he will `` honestly accept the harsh criticism'' over the stock scandal and try to restore public confidence in government. The scandal involves <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information services conglomerate that has been accused of trying to gain favor in political circles. It sold unlisted stocks in a subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> real estate company, at bargain prices to more than 150 influential politicians, bureaucrats and journalists before public trading in the shares began in October 1986. The share prices rose sharply then, and some buyers made nearly $ 80,000 in tax-free profits.

 About 1,500 people crowded into a Roman Catholic church Sunday to hear <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, who helped reopen a former convent as a new home for part of her missionary order. `` I hope they're going to do something beautiful for God,'' <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> said at the morning Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is very important to help each other and share with each other.'' The visit by the winner of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize was later cut short when she started feeling faint and was helped out of the church to rest. <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convent </ORGANIZATION>, formerly home of Sisters of Charity but closed for 17 years because of declining membership, will be home to 13 nuns who are members of <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Missionaries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION>, Contemplative Branch, said the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirandi </PERSON>, pastor of the church.

 Gunmen burst into a home Sunday and fatally shot a Roman Catholic lawyer who recently represented the family of a slain <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla and a man accused of killing two soldiers. Police said three men broke into the north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> house of <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>, 30, and opened fire on him and his wife, <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON>, who was believed to be slightly wounded in the leg. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion fell on <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists. Police were investigating reports that a taxi hijacked in a loyalist Protestant area of the city was used in the attack. The <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, an outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary group, has slain two Roman Catholics in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> in the past two weeks. <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> was a prominent <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> lawyer. Late last year he was involved in the <LOCATION> Craigavon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>, inquest into the 1983 police killings of three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas who the families claimed were victims of an alleged police `` shoot to kill'' campaign against Irish nationalists. <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>, acting for the family of one of the dead, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Toman </PERSON>, went to the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> High Court demanding that three policemen involved in the shooting be forced to attend and give evidence to the inquest. The coroner had initially directed that the policemen need not attend but only submit statements. <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> eventually won his case, but on appeal by the authorities the inquest was adjourned indefinitely. In a recent case, <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> succeeded in having charges dropped against a man in connection with the killing of two soldiers at an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral last year. <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Dermot </PERSON>, who escaped from <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s Maze Prison where he was serving a term for terrorist offenses, is fighting extradition from the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> to Ulster where he is wanted for questioning in connection with the killing of a policeman. The case will be heard at <ORGANIZATION> Dublin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to push the British out of this Protestant-dominated province, join it with the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and set up an all-Ireland socialist state.

<HEAD>Brake Failure to Blame for Runaway Train, Inspectors Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The crew of a runaway train that caused a devastating explosion earlier this month apparently set the train's air brakes, but it remains a mystery why the brakes failed, federal inspectors said But <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION> officials, federal inspectors and employees disagree over whether the train's hand brakes also should have been set while the crew changed locomotives near the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Divide on Feb. 2. Forty-eight cars got away from the crew about nine miles west of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> and rolled back into town, colliding with a three-locomotive unit. Twenty-one cars derailed and one containing hydrogen peroxide exploded shortly before 5 a.m., shattering windows up to two miles away, spewing shrapnel for hundreds of yards and knocking out power for up to six hours in parts of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>. About 2,000 people were evacuated within a square mile of the accident in 30-below-zero weather. Officials estimated the damage at $ 3 million, although only a few people suffered minor injuries. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditzel </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s field investigation into the accident, said an event recorder indicates that before the train's six locomotives were separated from the 48 cars, a `` substantial application'' of the air brakes was made. `` They -LRB- air brakes -RRB- should have held the train,'' he said late last week. `` But it is obvious they did n't.'' Post-accident tests indicated air brakes on four cars were defective and other brakes may have been coated with ice and snow, possibly hampering their effectiveness, <PERSON> Ditzel </PERSON> adds. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the hand brakes also should have been set, but were not. But <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION> officials debate that contention. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON>, president of the company, said he does not believe failure to set the hand brakes was a violation of operation procedure. The General Code of Operating Rules, a set of regulations followed by 13 major railroads, including <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION>, says air brakes `` must not be depended upon to hold a train, engine or car when left unattended.'' <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON> said the phrase `` left unattended'' means when cars that are left for an extended period without supervision, perhaps as long as several days. Over long periods of time, air brakes can lose their holding ability. The hand brakes are used as a backup.

 Former Klan leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> has sidestepped several attempts to derail his candidacy for the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, and is mounting a door-to-door push for the final week of the campaign. Opponents were thwarted last week in two actions designed to discredit <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s candidacy. A lawsuit challenging his residency was not filed, although it still might be later, and militant Jewish protesters were unable to obtain a last-minute parade permit. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, 38, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, 62, are contenders Saturday for a state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat from a nearly all-white district in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> suburb. Both men are Republicans. `` I think we're going to win ... with about 54 percent of the vote or better,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. `` I think that the attacks, the character assassinations, make people more determined than ever to make their own choice.'' The race between the articulate <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, a conservative home builder whose brother <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> was the first Republican governor since Reconstruction, has generated contributions and comment from around the country. The New York-based Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> held an indoor rally Sunday to warn people about <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. A protest march by the group through downtown <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> was canceled because the group's leader <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> failed to obtain a parade permit 15 days in advance of the event. `` As a man I do not hate Mr. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Galatas </PERSON>, a black activist, told the crowd of less than 100. `` But I think he is a threat and he is very dangerous for what he believes in and what he stands for.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, who was imperal wizard of the Knights of the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> before he left the group in 1980, led a field of seven candidates in last month's primary with 33 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> came in second with 19 percent of the vote. Under <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s open primary system, the top two vote-getters in the primary go into the runoff, whatever their party, if no candidates gets more than half the vote. Attorney <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, representing some of the failed candidates, has delayed until after the election filing a lawsuit challenging <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s residency in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> district. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s claims that he lived in a condominium in the district appear to be fraudulent because utility records indicate the residence had no electricity until last September. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, who said he wo n't talk about his living arrangements because of threats, will spend the last week of the race going door-to-door in the 21,000-voter district. `` People now know that we can win. People have been waiting for a long time for a candidate to come across and talk about these issues,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. `` If <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> wins this race, it will break the ice.'' Issues on <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s platform include requiring welfare recipients to work, offering incentives for women on welfare to be sterilized, providing tax credits for education, eliminating affirmative action programs and keeping a property tax exemption for home owners. `` I think nobody really understood how deep the support is for the programs I represent,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> of jumping on the Republican bandwagon, saying lower taxes, less government and self-sufficiency have been GOP goals for years. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s candidacy has brought widespread opposition. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, appeared in <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION> a week ago and backed <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, saying the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> has no place for Klansmen. Roman Catholic Archbishop <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannan </PERSON> and other religious leaders had a vigil last week in apparent opposition to <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s candidacy, although <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> was never mentioned by name `` We can not allow the philosophy of the white hood ... to gain acceptability,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON>. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> has said the election of <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> would send a `` terrible signal'' to the country about <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, who joined the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> as a teen-ager, left after being accused of trying to sell secret Klan membership rolls. He began calling himself a white civil rights worker and founded the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, but he said it is not racist but aims at civil rights for all people. During the campaign, he has answered accusations that a telephone number listed to the Klan rings in his home by saying he is just trying to make it easier for people to contact him.

<HEAD>Security Council To Approve Namibian Peacekeeping Force This Week</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> this week will approve a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> of 4,650 troops, officials said, far fewer than the number demanded by black African nations. After weeks of lobbying for 7,500 peacekeepers, African countries and non-aligned nations have agreed to send the smaller contingent proposed by Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. The five permanent <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ had pushed for the less costly smaller force, which is still expected to cost about $ 416 million for one year. The 7,500 peacekeepers would have cost about $ 700 million, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have said. The black African nations contended that cutting the size of the Namibian force would signal the population there that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> was more concerned about cost-cutting than ending <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 74-year rule over the territory, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colony. Black African nations also feared that a reduced peacekeeping force would tempt <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to tamper with elections in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in November to prevent the main guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, from winning a majority. Namibians are to election a constituent assembly that will adopt a constitution and organize a black majority-ruled government. In a report released Friday, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> assured the black African nations that the permanent <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members would allow him to dispatch up to 7,500 troops if the military situation in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> warrants. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> also authorized the peacekeepers to carry weapons, an exception to the normal policy under which peacekeepers are unarmed. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said Friday that he expected the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to approve the secretary-general's recommendations Monday or Tuesday. The five permanent <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members, who together pay 57 percent of the cost of peacekeeping, contended that a peace accord signed in December by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> reduced the need for peacekeepers. Under the accords, 50,000 Cuban troops are to be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by mid-1991, with half of them out by November, as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> cooperates with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s one-year plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence beginning April 1 <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is half the size of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but has a population of 1.3 million, one-tenth of whom are whites. r

 Prime Minister-elect <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> and the defeated <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> joined about 500 people in church Sunday for a special `` service of national peace and unity'' after a tense election campaign. The longtime and often bitter rivals smiled and shook hands as they took seats in the front pew of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. They sat next to Governor-General Sir <PERSON> Florizel </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasspole </PERSON>, who is to swear <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> in on Monday. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, 64, bruised his right shin Saturday when a car he was riding in collided head-on with a pickup truck, but he showed no signs of injury on Sunday. The Gothic-style church was filled, and several people stood in the doorways for the solemn service. The congregation, which included <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sotirhos </PERSON> and many other diplomats, sang the Jamaican national anthem and patriotic hymns such as `` Once To Every Man and Nation'' and `` I Pledge My Heart Forever.'' In his sermon, the Rev. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a Methodist minister, reminded the gathering of New Testament teachings to turn the other cheek and not take vengeance. `` We have left behind us, we pray, a situation in which our country reached almost the very depths of insanity,'' he said. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, who was prime minister from 1972 to 1980, was returned to power Thursday in a landslide victory over <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, a conservative who led the country for eight years. Some ballots still were being recounted during the weekend and final results were not available. Revised unofficial results gave <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 45 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to 15 for <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>'s party had held all 60 parliamentary seats since <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> boycotted the last election, in 1983, in a dispute over voter registration lists. The prime minister-elect had said he wanted to hold an ecumenical service before being sworn in Monday to foster a sense of national unity and patriotism in the aftermath of the hard-fought campaign. On entering the church Sunday, <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said he expected the new government to take over in a conciliatory atmosphere. `` I started my term that way, and I expect this term will start that way, too,'' he told a reporter. Warfare between political gangs left at least 13 people dead and scores wounded during the three-week campaign. The violence was nowhere near as bad as in 1980, when <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> last held a contested election. Then, an estimated 700 people died during a nine-month campaign. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> left the church together, shaking hands with well-wishers. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> was briefly mobbed by supporters at his car. At one stage, he raised a finger to his lips to shush the crowd. Glasspole, as representative of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, is to swear <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> into office Monday afternoon. <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, which gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1962 belongs to the British <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, the global association of former <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> colonies and territories headed by the queen. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, 58, remains prime minister until <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> is sworn in.

 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on Sunday called on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to prove that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had agreed to free a terrorist in exchange for the release of French hostages in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has claimed that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> promised to free <PERSON> Anis </PERSON> <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>, a Lebanese national and convicted leader of a pro-Iranian terror squad, in exchange for three <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> hostages released in May. <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON> is serving a life sentence for leading an assassination attempt against former Iranian Prime Minister <PERSON> Shapour </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakhtiar </PERSON> in 1980. <PERSON> Bakhtiar </PERSON> survived but a French woman and a police officer were killed. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said that when <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> submitted his resignation following elections that returned a Socialist government to power last spring, he did not ask for <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>'s release. Speaking on the weekly television news show `` Seven on Seven,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> assured him that the only committment <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had made was to promise `` to restore diplomatic relations'' with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` I have no reason to doubt the words of Mr. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>,'' the president said, adding that it was necessary for `` the <LOCATION> Iranians </LOCATION> to provide proof that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has failed to meet its committments. `` If such is the case, it is understood that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s word will be kept. But to my knowledge, this is not the case.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> discussed the matter with his Iranian counterpart <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> while on a trip to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last week. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said there was a gentlemen's agreement to free <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>, confirmed in telephone calls from <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> to Iranian officials. The president of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament, <PERSON> Hachemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsandjani </PERSON>, on Saturday repeated the claim that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was guaranteed <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>'s release Interior Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Joxe </PERSON> said last week `` unfortunately, we have no official report, no trace of the conditions in which the release of the hostages was negotiated by the <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> government.'' He said he asked for a written report from his predecessor, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON>, who led the effort to free the hostages, but was turned down. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> noted in the interview Sunday that <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON> and four other members of the terrorist gang `` were convicted of crimes.'' `` They are not hostages. We do not take hostages,'' he said. There are 15 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They include nine Americans, three Britons, one Belgian, one Irishman and one Italian. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was abducted March 16, 1985.

 The yacht Thursday's Child sailed triumphantly under the Golden Gate Bridge on Sunday, breaking by eight days the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-to-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> speed record set in 1854. The 60-foot sloop crossed the finish line at 12:32 p.m. and was met by cheers and yells from hundreds of spectators. Thursday's Child set sail Nov. 23 on a 14,500-mile voyage that took it around treacherous <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> on the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` I would n't do anything different, but I would n't do it again _ once is enough,'' said skipper-owner <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON> after he stepped ashore. <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON> and the other two crew members waved to the crowd after bettering the 89-day, eight-hour trip by the 229-foot clipper ship Flying Cloud during the Gold Rush. The crew docked the 10-ton vessel at Blossom Rock, about two miles from the Golden Gate, because they said the submerged point is where clipper ships used to drop anchor. About 80 ships were out on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to greet the modern racing sloop, while other spectators gathered on the roof of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> and at the south tower of the Golden Gate Bridge. A biplane flew overhead trailing a sign that read: `` We love you TC.'' Thursday's Child's entrance into the bay was delayed for hours by a four-knot outgoing tide and by a lack of wind. The crew tried everything, including putting out a large sail called a spinnaker, but all its sails drooped. Finally, under a bright, cloudless sky the yacht was able to sail under the Golden Gate. Dozens of sailboats and powerboats had headed out the Golden Gate for the occasion and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> sent a 95-foot cutter and four utility boats to escort the yacht into the bay and lessen the danger of a spectator boat accidentally ramming Thursday's Child. The yacht left from <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, 18 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> after 80 days and 20 hours, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, race timekeeper at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. He said Thursday's Child broke three other sailing records; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to the equator, set in 1856; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>, 1857; and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, 1854. The times and old records were not immediately available. In a ship-to-shore interview earlier Sunday, crew member <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazleton </PERSON> said he had `` that coming-home feeling.'' `` It's kind of like a mixed bag of emotions right now,'' said <PERSON> Hazleton </PERSON>. `` Both relief, letdown, that the whole thing's over, and just a general feeling of accomplishment.'' The crew _ <PERSON> Hazleton </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Palmetto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Alachua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>, who helped design the vessel _ had spent Saturday zig-zagging north against a stubborn headwind that delayed the ship's arrival by one day. <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON> launched Thursday's Child for the 1984 solo trans-Atlantic race, in which she was the first American entry and the first single-hulled boat to finish. The Flying Cloud was a merchantman that also ferried Gold Rush adventurers around the dangerous <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> at the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and up to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. It could carry 35 sails on its tall masts and was the fastest of thousands of clippers that raced each other across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The ship wrecked on rocks off <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, in 1874 and nothing is left of it. In the past seven years, five racing boats trying to beat Flying Cloud's record sank in the howling gales and treacherous rocks of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>. A second boat also attempting to break Flying Cloud's record was damaged last week in a storm off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>. The Bark of the West, a 60-foot monohull, was in its 56th day of sailing. Thursday's Child also had trouble during its run at the record; it had to stop at the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> for repairs after it struck an unknown object. The modern vessel survived <PERSON> Cape </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Hazleton </PERSON> expressed awe and respect for the power of the sea when he recalled the passage around the cape. ` It got pretty bad ... very unpleasant,'' <PERSON> Hazelton </PERSON> said in an interview by radio last week. He said they spent six days and nights sailing into the teeth of wind gusting to 60 knots, through seas that raged from all directions.

 A newspaper reported Sunday that <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the wife of jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, took part in the beatings of young boys allegedly abducted by her bodyguards. One the boys, 14-year-old <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>, had been missing since Jan. 1 and his body was reportedly found last week. The Sunday Star, a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper that opposes apartheid, said Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> whipped four boys brought to her house in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> last month by young men who call themselves the <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> soccer team. The paper did not identify its sources. The report deepened the controversy surrounding Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, who has denied wrongdoing and implied allegations against her were fabricated to hurt her husband. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 54, in responding to allegations against her Friday, told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, `` It's not going to destroy <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>.'' `` It's absurd that this particular name -LRB- <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> -RRB- and this family can be associated with all the allegations that are being flung around,'' she said. Prominent <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> activists and <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders have accused <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> members of assaulting four boys after abducting them from a church in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, a black township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said one of the youths escaped and alerted community leaders meeting at a nearby Methodist church. Dr. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON>, a well-known anti-apartheid physician, eventually went to the house, saw the beaten boys, `` and warned that <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> had been so badly assaulted that he would not live,'' the newspaper said. The next day, <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON> was shot and killed at his Soweto office by two young men pretending to be patients. Police are investigating the killing. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that no <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> members were involved in <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON>'s disappearance. She was quoted Sunday by the black-oriented <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> newspaper as acknowledging the boys were taken to her home but denying she was present. City Press quoted <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who describes himself as <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s former coach, as saying he hit the boys to make them admit they had been sexually molested by a white Methodist minister. `` I gave them a few smacks to make them tell the truth,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 41, was quoted as saying. The Rev. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mogoba </PERSON>, national leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said the allegations against the Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Verryn </PERSON> were fabricated to divert attention from the `` ruthless actions of the ` football team' and the disappearance and possible death of <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON>. The Weekly Mail, another anti-apartheid newspaper, on Friday quoted an unidentified <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> activist as saying <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>'s body was dug up Thursday in the township. Police said Friday that the report could not be confirmed. Exiled African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaders and prominent anti-apartheid leaders in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, have urged Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> to disband <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. She said the team has been disbanded, but about eight young men continue to live at her house. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has said police investigating the case expect difficulty finding witnesses willing to testify against Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the country's best-known black leader, is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.

 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities have secretly contacted the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, according to an Italian newspaper. However, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader said the Israeli government also was planning `` new attacks on our leadership,'' according to an interview in the Rome-based daily <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Messaggero </PERSON>. Israeli authorities `` are sending us many messages secretly, through our representatives in the occupied territories -LRB- and -RRB- other channels in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said in the interview published Saturday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> officially says it will not negotiate directly with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said: `` The ministry of foreign affairs has had no contacts wth the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'' and that he had no knowledge of planned attacks on <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials have held unofficial meetings with members of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and left-wing members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Asked who contacted the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said: `` I'm speaking of Israeli authorities. And in the past there were also these kinds of indirect contacts. Also during the occupation of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> there were negotiations through <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Habib </PERSON>, the special -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- envoy from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982, forcing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to abandon <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said in spite of the contacts, he has received information that the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret service has orders to `` bring forth new attacks on our leadership.'' He did not give details. `` At the same time, -LRB- the Israelis -RRB- are planning a scenario of war in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'' for the late spring or summer, he said. Israeli troops and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas have clashed frequently in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew most of its soldiers from the neighboring country in 1985. Israeli troops remain in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone along the border <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also said he would agree to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s proposal to hold elections in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> only `` after the withdrawal of Israeli troops and under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> supervision.'' In the past, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders have said they will not agree to elections in the occupied territories until the area receives complete autonomy. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army would withdraw from several cities in the occupied territories if the Palestinian inhabitants accepted `` limited autonomy.''

 A teen-ager opened fire with an automatic pistol on a crowded subway platform early Sunday, wounding six people, one seriously, police said. The gunman fired a 9mm automatic pistol at a group of about 40 people waiting on a platform in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> borough about 1:10 a.m., said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, a Transit Police spokesman. The suspect, who witnesses described as being about 17 years old, fled and no arrests were made, officials said. No weapon was recovered but five 9mm shell casings were found.

At least one of the victims attended the party, he said. Four men and two teen-age girls were wounded.

<TEXT>
 Government officials were questioning 22 fishermen Monday who returned to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> after 15 days of captivity in communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The fishermen arrived in the port of <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> aboard two trawlers Sunday and were met by government security officials who declined to be identified. In the past, fishermen captured and released by the north have been questioned several days before being allowed to return to their families. North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, divided since 1945, are still technically at war and a peace treaty never has been signed. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> seized the fishermen and their two ships on Jan. 28, saying the vessels had illegally entered North Korean territorial waters in the Yellow Sea. On Friday, the president of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang-hyup </PERSON>, said he had been notified the north would return the fishermen for humanitarian reasons.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> this month, officials said, indicating an increasing Soviet role in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said the Soviet minister will visit <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on Feb. 19 and the king indicated he had little objection to renewed Soviet relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if they lead to an Arab-Israeli peace conference. `` If there is a move toward the establishment of peace, obviously any objections to anyone restoring relations with anyone in this part of the world become of secondary importance,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in an interview with Japanese reporters. Restoration of <LOCATION> Soviet-Israeli </LOCATION> relations, severed during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, are an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> condition for the Soviet role in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace talks demanded by <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and other Arab leaders. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said he was `` quite optimistic'' that an international conference peace could take place soon, given recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet efforts to solve other regional problems. He urged <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders to abandon their opposition to involving the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in peace talks. `` I ca n't see any solution to the Palestinian problem without the participation of the Palestinians,'' the king said. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> refused to commit <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to a confederation with a proposed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state _ an idea floated earlier partly to overcome <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and American opposition to an independent Palestinian entity. In <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhuravlev </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Shevaradnadze </PERSON> is expected to visit the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> capital some time this month, though no exact date has been set. <PERSON> Zhuravlev </PERSON> spoke to reporters after a meeting with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and the prosecution in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra case agreed Sunday on more stringent safeguards for classified material whose threatened release delayed the trial. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> on Sunday granted a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> request to delay <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial from Monday's scheduled start until Friday, when the full <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to consider the department's objections to the planned release of classified material by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense. Hours later, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> announced a motion had been filed asking the judge in the case, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, to impose more stringent safeguards on <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s use of classified material. `` The requested relief, if granted, would provide necessary assurance that the Attorney General would remain in a position throughout the trial to protect against unauthorized disclosure of classified information,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> agreed that this protection `` does not interfere in any way with the Independent Counsel's ability to carry out his duties,'' said the statement. If the proposal is approved by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will ask the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to lift the stay immediately so the North trial may proceed, according to separate statements issued by the department and <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and the department filed a sealed motion with <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> `` which requests that the district court enter an additional protective order preventing the release of classified information vital to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security interests,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. North's attorneys, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, did not return phone calls to their business answering service seeking comment. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> on Sunday ordered `` that the trial proceedings in <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> versus <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> ... be stayed'' pending consideration by the full <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. A jury in the case was selected Thursday and returns to court Monday morning. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, whose office is prosecuting <PERSON> North </PERSON>, had opposed the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to delay the trial and wanted to proceed immediately with opening arguments, saying that national security concerns had been amply addressed. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting concerns of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies, feels that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has imposed inadequate controls on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and that the fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide would be permitted to pour out secrets in the courtroom that are damaging to national security. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> concluded, and the Independent Counsel concurred, that the trial could not go forward without an additional protective order, and that it is essential for the court to enter such an order,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It said that without such an order, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concluded and the Independent Counsel concurred, `` that it will be impossible during the defense's opening statement and presentation of evidence to protect against the unnecessary and uncontrolled disclosure of classified information.'' The information was described in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement as `` of vital importance to the national security and the foreign relations of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The department said that `` an enormous number'' of the 300 classified documents North may use at his trial `` are not yet clearly covered by a protective order of the court.'' The department said it believes that `` the joint motion will resolve any remaining differences with respect to the handling of classified information.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> issued a separate statement saying that the independent counsel filed the motion with <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> and that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` agreed to the motion.'' Government sources familiar with the agreement say the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> retreated from the drastic position it took Wednesday. The department at that time sought a court order saying <PERSON> North </PERSON> would be permitted to introduce no classified information unless the court ruled that it was relevant and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had no objection to its disclosure. Under the motion filed with <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> compromised by narrowing the broad objections it had to many categories of classified material that <PERSON> North </PERSON> plans to introduce at his trial, said government sources familiar with the proposed agreement. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on Wednesday rejected the depatment's request for the order seeking stringent controls over classified material North plans to present and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday began its efforts to delay the trial. The department sought to appeal, but an appeals court twice rebuffed the department's attempt to obtain a stay late last week. The department on Saturday went to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to delay the trial and the special prosecutor's office quickly filed counter arguments. The possibility of a compromise by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> came up Saturday when a government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the department wanted to try to work with <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office to resolve differences, which surfaced Wednesday The source said there would be a two-prong approach, with the attempt at cooperation taking place at the same time the department worked on preparing an affidavit to the court from the attorney general that would in effect bar disclosure of certain classified material North plans to use on the grounds that it would harm national security. Depending on the scope of the affidavit, such a drastic step could have led to dismissal of some or all of the 12 criminal charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, because he would be barred from using classified material in an attempt to prove his innocence. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> issued orders Dec. 12 and Jan. 19 spelling out how much censorship could be applied to classified material that the prosecution and defense planned to use at trial. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criticized <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s efforts in a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> filing on Saturday. `` The categories of information covered by the two orders were by no means exhaustive,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Much classified information remained unprotected and was not the subject of any pretrial ruling on admissibility.''

 Investigators suspect a fire that whipped through a historic shoe manufacturing district and destroyed six buildings was set by arsonists, police said. No one was seriously injured in the blaze, which caused an estimated $ 1 million damage as it roared out of control for more than two hours Saturday night, officials said. `` Nothing's for certain yet, but they do have reason to believe at this point that it was of suspicious origin,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` One thing was the speed with which it took off.'' The fire apparently broke out at about 10:30 p.m. in the former <ORGANIZATION> Birney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> building, which was erected in 1882. Several of the buildings housed shops, a tanning salon, pizza parlor, offices and other small businesses in the district, which was once the city's shoe manufacturing center.

<TEXT>
 The designated successor to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> called for an end to extremism in remarks published Sunday and urged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leaders to `` make up for past mistakes'' that isolated the Islamic republic. <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein-Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>'s comments, published by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Abrar </ORGANIZATION> daily, echoed recent calls by other Iranian leaders for critical self-examination as the Iranian revolution moves into its second decade. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> went further, however, by questioning the official doctrine that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> won the eight-year war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` People in the world got the idea that our business in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is just murdering people,'' <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> was quoted as saying in criticism of the self-imposed isolation. He spoke in the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> on Saturday at the climax of 10 days of celebrations marking the revolution's 10th anniversary. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, 64, has been increasingly critical of the revolution's shortcomings and repeatedly has called for a relaxation of its stringent religious, social and political restrictions In another indication of a more open political atmosphere, the Iranian news agency reported Sunday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s only legalized opposition party demanded that the government allow opposition newspapers and provide security needed for open political activity. It quoted <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazdi </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as saying the opposition group is not opposed to the rule of the Islamic clergy. `` Provided a free press, freedom of gatherings and freedom of thought, we will not turn our backs,'' he was quoted as saying. The group said it would participate in any open presidential elections. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>'s latest criticism was his strongest, and all the more telling because it was delivered on the anniversary of the day in 1979 when the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>'s government collapsed and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s revolutionaries took over. Speaking about the Iran-Iraq, <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> asked a question that a year ago would have been considered political heresy: `` Did we succeed in doing well during the imposed war, or did the enemies who imposed it turn out to be the victors?'' Hostilities halted Aug. 20 after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, battered by a string of military defeats, accepted a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire a year after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it was willing to do so. `` We should consider how many people we lost, how many splendid young men were martyred, how many cities were destroyed. We should take all these into account, then if we say we have made a mistake, we should repent,'' <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> said. `` We used slogans that frightened the world ... Have we succeeded in protecting the revolution and realizing its objectives? Have we delivered the promises we gave to the people?'' His hard-hitting comments follow unusually frank interviews by other Iranian leaders, including <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and Chief Justice <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardebili </PERSON>, in which they acknowledged that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s war strategy was flawed and that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention tipped the scales against <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>'s remarks contrasted with a Saturday speech by President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> to a rally in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, which was long on praise for the revolution's survival and short on criticism of its failings. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> admitted there were differences in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leadership but denied a power struggle exists. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> touched on one of the points of disagreement by advocating that Iranians who fled abroad be allowed to return to help rebuild an economy nearly ruined by the war. `` Those abroad are terrified,'' he said, in an apparent reference to a wave of executions in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the past six months. Iranian leaders have admitted some political prisoners have been executed. Dissident Iranians claim as many as 12,000 people have been killed. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> estimate there have been 1,000 executions. `` Set aside past mistakes and harsh treatment. Extremism is to our detriment. Try to treat -LRB- the exiles -RRB- with affection and Islamic behavior,'' <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s decision last week to pardon all political prisoners except `` those with sinister intentions,'' a reference to about 900 considered hard-core opponents. `` Filling the prisons will not heal any wounds,'' <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> declared.

 Rival gangs armed with assault rifles were involved in several weekend shootings that killed two people, including a pregnant teen-ager early Sunday, police said. <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was shot several times in the upper torso as she was standing with a group of people outside a housing project just after midnight, said Detective <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spreitzer </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, who was eight months pregnant, was pronounced dead at the scene, east of downtown. A 19-year-old man was shot several times in the back with the same assault rifle that struck Ms. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> and was seriously wounded, <PERSON> Spreitzer </PERSON> said. A 26-year-old <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> man also was wounded after being hit several times with shotgun pellets, <PERSON> Spreitzer </PERSON> said. The attack was believed to be part of a narcotics turf war in the project, said Lt. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Robleto </PERSON>. The assailants, who shouted gang slogans as they fled the scene, only were described as three males, the detective said. In a drive-by attack on Saturday, <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, 22, was struck by gunfire from a passing car at 5:30 a.m. while sitting in a car with another person at an intersection in suburban <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION>, said sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> drove himself to a friend's house where paramedics treated him before taking him to <LOCATION> Greater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he died.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to a Moslem family, has ignited fires of protest among Moslems worldwide with his prize-winning novel, `` The Satanic Verses,'' a story about the eternal conflict between good and evil. The novel takes its name from the verses the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> removed from Islam's holy book, the Koran, on grounds they were inspired by Satan. Moslem critics _ whom <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has called fundamentalist extremists _ say the book is blasphemous and have protested from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. On Sunday, five people died and at least 80 were wounded when police fired on a crowd of protesters outside a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government office in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, who were demanding that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ban the book. The novel's protagonists are an Indian movie star and a British TV personality, both passengers who fall from an airliner blown up by terrorists en route from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. They are presumed dead but they survive, or are reborn, and take on the attributes of the angel <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> and Satan. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> denies that his novel attacks the Islamic religion, which he says has been of central importance to him all his life. He said it deals with `` migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love, death, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>.'' He said the disputed passage concerning a prophet living in a fantastic city of sand which dissolves when water falls upon it, happens in a dream -- `` the fictional dream of a fictional character ... and one who is losing his mind at that. How much further from history could one get?'' The novel was first published in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in September and got generally good reviews but it was banned in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and some Arab countries. Moslem religious leaders in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> condemned it as a `` deliberate attack on a faith and its founders.'' Moslems threatened to boycott bookshops stocking it and some shops, frightened by demonstrators, removed it from their shelves. British writers protested the attacks and playwright <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoppard </PERSON>, poet <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Spender </PERSON> and novelist <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> <PERSON> Amis </PERSON> were among a number who cabled Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> protesting at the ban. In November, the book won the `` new novel'' category in the annual literary competition sponsored by the Whitbread brewing giant, but it did not win the overall <ORGANIZATION> Whitbread </ORGANIZATION> prize, which went in January to a first novel by another writer. The Guardian, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s liberal daily, on Monday quoted <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> as saying he was `` very upset'' at the deaths in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on Saturday and he felt that leaders of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s religious parties were whipping up emotion. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was quoted as saying: `` The thing that is most disturbing is that they are talking about a book that does n't exist. The book that is worth killing people for and burning flags for is not the book that I wrote. The people who demonstrated in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and who were killed have n't actually read the book because it is n't on sale there.'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is 41 and a British citizen. He grew up in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, came to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> at age 14 and won honors for history studies at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He has six books behind him, including three prize-winning novels, `` Midnight's Children,'' `` Shame'' and `` The Satanic Verses,'' and `` The Jaguar Smile'' about his travels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

 Police fired on hundreds of protesters Sunday who stormed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government office to demand the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ban a novel they consider offensive to Moslems. At least five people died and 80 were injured, doctors said. Police repeatedly fired semi-automatic weapons, rifles and shotguns at charging protesters who yelled `` American dogs!'' and hurled rocks and bricks during three hours of fierce clashes. The rioting erupted when more than 2,000 fundamentalists tried to march to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to demand the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ban `` The Satanic Verses,'' an acclaimed novel by <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> banned the novel on grounds it offends Moslems by suggesting the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> was fallible. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> also banned the novel. In <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was spending the weekend, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were monitoring the <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> situation closely. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, telephoned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> early Sunday to tell him of the riot. `` God is great!'' protesters screamed as they smashed windows and started fires after driving off scores of police. They tore down the American flag at the center and danced in delight as it was burned, along with effigies representing the Indian-born <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Hang <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>,'' one man yelled. Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and 15 Pakistanis employeed at the center were in the building at the time but were not hurt, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats said. `` There was a pitched battle going on outside,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Obee </PERSON>, head of the center, which contains a public library and dispenses information about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Doctors at area hospitals, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least five people had been killed by police gunfire and 65 protesters shot and wounded. They said the injured included Moslem theology students and about 20 police hit by rocks or beaten by the rampaging crowd. Police arrested at least 65 protesters, and angry officers were seen beating and kicking some of those arrested. Hospitals reported at least 80 injuries. Some protesters attacked the nearby <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> travel agency, smashing windows and starting a fire before police drove them off. Enraged demonstrators also attacked three Western journalists, including two <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondents and an Atlanta Constitution correspondent. They were not injured. Police in blue helmets and armed with bamboo canes and metal shields initially tried to disperse the crowds with tear gas and batons, but the mob hurled the tear gas canisters back and repeatedly charged police. Police fired in the air and then began shooting into the crowd as protesters advanced. Other officers ran to escape the mob. Protest leaders said `` The Satanic Verses'' should be banned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and all other nations. `` There are insulting remarks in this book. There are lies in this book,'' said <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadique </PERSON>. The novel takes its name from the verses the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> removed from Islam's holy book, the Koran, on grounds they were inspired by Satan. The novel's protagonists are an Indian movie star and a British TV personality, both passengers who fall from an airliner blown up by terrorists en route from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

Police had been stationed around the center for hours before the march. Some opposition lawmakers and Moslem leaders said police overreacted and mishandled the situation. `` It was a very brutal attack against a peaceful demonstration,'' they said in a joint statement.

 Leftist guerrillas on Sunday claimed responsibility for launching an attack outside the presidential palace and setting off a bomb at a university. There were no reports of injuries and the palace was not damaged, but the campus explosion shattered windows and destroyed furniture. The pro-Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed responsibilty in phone calls to local newspapers, left flyers near the campus explosion demanding guarantees that their military leader, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Polay </PERSON>, not be harmed. <PERSON> Polay </PERSON> was captured Feb. 3 in <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, an Andean city 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Money Magazine Index Shows Investors Removing Money From Thrifts</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release at 6:30 p.m. EST; Time set by source.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Small investors removed funds from the nation's banking system _ particularly savings and loans _ at the rate of $ 6 billion a week late last month, according to information gathered for an investment survey Since early January, investors pulled nearly $ 19 billion from commercial banks and thrifts, according to data provided to Money magazine for its Small Investor Index. Savings and loans lost 2.5 percent of their savings and money-market account assets, the survey found. Much of this money flowed to money-market funds offered by mutual fund companies and brokerages, the magazine said. The magazine said the investors' actions are driven by several factors: _ A fear that they might not see their money for weeks or months should their savings and loan fail _ Concern that federal action to bail out the troubled thrift industry could end up hurting small savers _ The belief that banks and thrifts will pay lower yields in the future after the closure of weak savings and loans that paid extremely high rates to lure cash _ The higher rates of return being offered by money-market mutual funds On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported that savings and loan customers withdrew a record $ 8.1 billion from their accounts in December. It was the eighth consecutive month of net withdrawals from the thrifts, the bank board said.

<HEAD>Parties Disputing Nuclear Plant To Meet On Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parties involved in the dispute over the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its idle <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant spent Sunday pondering a federal judge's ruling and a proposed settlement that may finally end the debate. `` There are lots of things to think about,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladeck </PERSON>, an attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> ratepayers, who was in her <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office Sunday going over the weekend's developments with her clients. On Saturday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> threw out a $ 22.8 million judgment against <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION>, saying the case involving electricity rates belonged before the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, not the courts. On Monday, the parties were scheduled to gather in <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>'s chambers to review a settlement outlined Saturday by a federal mediator that would close the $ 5.4 billion Shoreham plant on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which has never operated commercially <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials also planned to meet Monday to consider appealing <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>'s ruling. `` I'm quite confident that it is in the interest of all the parties to settle this case -LRB- Monday -RRB-,'' the mediator, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON>, said Sunday. <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON> said the settlement calls for the shutdown of <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> and a $ 400 million reduction in <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION>'s planned rate increases over the next 10 years. The settlement would take effect if Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> approves it within 15 days of its approval by <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The financially troubled utility company and <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> declined comment on the proposed settlement; a spokesman for <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Executive <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> expressed cautious acceptance. Under a similar settlement proposed by the governor last year, the state would have bought <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> for $ 1 and closed it; <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> was to get annual rate increases of about 5 percent. The proposal was criticized as too expensive to ratepayers and it died when the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> failed to act on it. <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON>'s proposal reduces the proposed increases by about $ 400 million and contains provisions to settle a lawsuit by <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> against the town of <LOCATION> Brookhaven </LOCATION>, which the utility says overassessed <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> by more than $ 500 million. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>'s ruling came more than two months after a federal jury found that <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> had lied to obtain rate increases to help pay for <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>. The verdict exposed <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> to the possibility of a class-action suit that could have resulted in billions of dollars in damages. Though he allowed the trial to continue, <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> ruled Saturday that the issue should not be decided in federal court under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. `` What the trial proved ... was that RICO can not, and should not, be applied in a case such as this to permit a federal jury in a civil case to second guess the ratemaking authority of the state,'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> ruled. Construction on the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> plant, 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, began in 1973 and it was largely finished a decade later. But legal objections to the plant were raised by state and local governments and many <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> residents, who contend they could not safely evacuate the area should there be a plant emergency. The delays pushed the cost of <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> to $ 5.4 billion, more than 70 times the original estimate. The dispute has taken <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> to the brink of bankruptcy several times.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Major American steel companies are spending millions of dollars to try to document alleged unfair trading practices by leading steel-exporting nations. The move is part of a campaign by the American steel industry to win an extension of a series of pacts that set product-by-product limits on the amount of foreign steel that can be shipped into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The pacts were negotiated by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and other nations in 1984 in response to complaints by American steelmakers that they could not compete with a flood of subsidized, foreign imports. The agreements expire Sept. 30, and <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and other leading steelmakers want to be certain they are renewed. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has pledged to support the pacts, although no specifics have been offered on whether they would be continued in their present form. The wild cards in the negotiations will be the nations themselves. They are under no obligation to restrict their imports again, as they did voluntarily five years ago. In order to pressure the trading partners, American steelmakers have been paying millions of dollars to lawyers to compile `` unfair trading cases'' against the countries, according to <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> executives. In the cases, the lawyers are detailing allegations of foreign government subsidies to steelmakers and `` dumping,'' or selling products in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at below fair-market value. The unfair trading cases may never actually be filed with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, an independent agency with authority to order tariffs or other import relief for injured domestic industries. But the American companies are compiling the cases anyway so the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can use the information as leverage in negotiations. Trade cases are `` an alternative, an expensive undesirable alternative,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boni </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a recent interview. While steel industry officials are reluctant to publicly discuss the specifics of such cases, <PERSON> Boni </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Parsippany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, spent $ 2 million recently just on lawyers who are compiling them. He said larger steelmakers probably were spending more. Under the five-year trade pacts, imports have been reduced from 26.4 percent of the American steel market in 1984 to about 20.5 percent last year. Meanwhile, employment levels and profit among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steelmakers were up last year over 1987. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steelmakers say they continue to need the protection of import curbs, some other American manufacturers contend the restraints have created steel shortages in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and driven up prices.

<HEAD>PaineWebber Announces Agreement To Form Transportation Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Sunday an agreement under which its transportation group, which provides investment banking services to the airline and aerospace industry, will become a separate corporation that will retain ties to the Wall Street firm. As part of the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> will provide approximately 32 percent of the new corporation's $ 10 million in equity capital and will work jointly with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> on public offerings, placements of high-yield, or `` junk bond,'' securities, and other transactions for the airlines and aerospace industries, officials said. In 1988, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>'s transportation division completed 50 transactions representing more than $ 3 billion in financing for 27 clients worldwide, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` Through this entity there is a real opportunity to expand our client base and revenue stream,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steuert </PERSON>, chief executive officer of the new group. <PERSON> Steuert </PERSON> has been a managing director of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> and director of its transportation group since 1984. <PERSON> Steuert </PERSON> said he and the approximately 20 other <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> employees who decided to form the new company wanted the opportunity to invest their own funds in the transportation group. He also said they were motivated by the desire to enter investment areas that are not part of the traditional businesses of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>, such as fund and money management for institutional investors. <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> is one of Wall Street's largest investment firms, with both individual and institutional clients. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> reported sharply lower earnings for the fourth quarter of 1988 and for the year as a whole. It said the results reflected a slowdown in the financial markets and one-time costs. The company's fouth-quarter profit was $ 512,000, down 93 percent from the $ 7 million in the same period of 1987. For all of 1988, profit dropped 41 percent to $ 42.4 million, compared with $ 72 million in 1987. Revenue for 1988 totaled $ 2.51 billion, up from $ 2.44 billion in 1987. The company said it would continue a program to boost profitability by reducing support staff, consolidating offices and shrinking marginal businesses. A company spokesman could not be reached Sunday to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> agreement.

<HEAD>Dollar Opens Higher, Stock Prices Fall In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar started the trading week substantially higher against the Japanese yen on Monday, while stock prices declined. The dollar opened at 128.60 yen, up 0.95 yen from Friday's close of 127.65 yen. A rise in prime lending rates by many American commercial banks and the news of a higher-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer price index for January, both announced on Friday, combined to spur the dollar's rally, said a dealer from the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> The dealer, who spoke anonymously, said the report showing the nation's producer price index for finished goods rose 1 percent last month was `` stunning news.'' Also Friday, numerous banks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> raised their prime lending rates from 10.5 percent to 11 percent. The rate is closely watched because bankers use it as a basis for calculating interest on corporate loans and for determining various types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including home equity loans. Higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates tend to make the dollar more attractive to foreign investors. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which closed at a record 32,131.99 points on Friday, lost 179.91 points, or 0.55 percent, shortly after the market opened to move to 31,952.08.

<HEAD>Newspaper: S&amp;L Executives Met Secretly To Discuss Future</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 30 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loan executives, some representing thrifts that later failed, met secretly in June 1985 to discuss ways to continue making deals and keep federal regulators off their backs, a newspaper reported Sunday About 19 thrifts were represented at the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> meeting, including 15 that have since failed, been declared insolvent or closed and merged with other institutions, the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Colonial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION>, an executive who attended, told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> he thought the session was a `` secret meeting.'' Colonial, based in Liberal, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, was the only out-of-state thrift represented. `` There was a general concern that if the regulators found out that all the S & amp; L guys got together they might misconstrue the situation,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` In 1985, there were a lot of scared people running around.'' The June 11, 1985, meeting was called by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Savings President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> and Chairman <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> in a May 22, 1985, letter written on <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> stationery. A copy of the letter was obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Continental Savings, based in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Bellaire </LOCATION>, later failed. `` We discovered the letter over a year ago,'' said <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, director of enforcement for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates savings and loans. `` We turned it over to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> as part of an ongoing criminal investigation.'' Sources who attended the meeting told the Post that several issues were discussed, including how to evade loan limits to one borrower and how to remove delinquent loans and foreclosed real estate from thrift books by selling them to other thrifts. Industry sources familiar with the meeting said the effect of those actions would have been to move bad loans around to hide them from regulators and make the thrifts appear to be in better financial shape than they were. Ms. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said such actions could be illegal, depending on the particular circumstances. `` Selling REO -LRB- real estate owned -RRB- can be perfectly lawful under certain circumstances, but if they were selling REO -LRB- to fool the regulators -RRB-, that would be a violation of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> rules and very likely a criminal violation _ willful misstatement of the books and records,'' she said. `` I remember them talking about selling REOs,'' said B.G. <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the father of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>. `` If something was done, it was after I left. I do n't know whether any of them got together on the REOs,'' <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> said. Another source who attended said the sale of REOs was discussed, along with evasion of loan limits and growth limits. <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> said he did n't remember anyone at the meeting discussing loan limits to one borrower.
