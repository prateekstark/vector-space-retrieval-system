 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> said Monday he is postponing a national referendum on his performance because `` violent leftist forces'' are trying to use it to overthrow the government. In an address on national television, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said `` it would not be of help to the country to hold a national referendum for my performance in office at this juncture.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said the referendum, which had been widely expected sometime next month, will be held sometime in the future but he gave no date. The president had been expected this week to announce the date to keep a promise he made during 1987 presidential elections. It was not clear if <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was backing away from the referendum because of concern about potential unrest or because he feared the government could not win the vote and might be forced into new elections. Some opposition and dissident groups had been demanding <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> stake his presidency on the referendum and step down if defeated. It is not clear if <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general, could win a referendum. The government had said earlier that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> would not step down if he were defeated, but some senior administration officials have conceded a defeat would put pressure on him to call new elections. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said anti-government forces were attempting to use the vote to organize violent protests and topple the government. Dissidents and radical students have organized violent demonstrations in recent weeks, but they have little popular support. `` The people are worried,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said. `` Leftist forces are trying to use the referendum as a foothold to overthrow the free democratic system.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s divided opposition parties were split over <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s decision The Party of Peace and Democracy of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> welcomed the decision, while the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young-sam </ORGANIZATION> said it would accept a temporary delay. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> had been pushing for a referendum after predicting <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> would lose. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> opposed a referendum, apparently because <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON>'s party had overtaken his party in opinion polls and could win presidential elections. The two Kims are bitter rivals who split the opposition vote in December 1987 presidential elections, allowing <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to win with 36 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> promised during the election campaign to hold a referendum after his first year in office to give voters a chance to evaluate his performance. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> also said `` national opinion'' was split on whether to hold the referendum. `` One opposition party said the referendum should be on the question of policy matters, while another party said it should be on a vote of no-confidence,'' he said. `` In view of these developments, the proposed referendum, originally intended to stabilize the political situation and solidify democratization, has lost its meaning,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said.

 A Liberian chemical tanker sank after burning for six days off the coast, with all 23 of its crew members still missing, the coast guard said. A Maritime Safety Agency official said the 23,038-ton Maasgusar broke in two on Sunday and sank, leaving a 700-foot-wide sheet of fire on the water's surface for about an hour, a coast guard official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no trace had been found of the 23 crew members _ 19 Filipinos, three Britons and an Irishman. He said water in the area, about 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inubozaki </LOCATION>, was about 18,480 feet deep and it would be difficult to raise the ship. The tanker had been heading for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> when it was discovered on fire in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> early Tuesday. The tanker was carrying 25,700 tons of chemicals, including ethylene chloride, isopropyl benzene and paraxylene, officials said.

 A gunman who neighbors said was harassed regularly by teen-agers shot three young children at an apartment building Saturday and then wounded a police officer before being killed in a gun battle, authorities said. One of the children, <PERSON> Ivory </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 9, died at 9:50 p.m. Saturday in the trauma center of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. She had gunshot wounds to the head, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, associate administrator of the hospital. Of the two other children, boys aged 8 and 12, one remained critical and the third was in stable condition at the hospital, <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> said. The administrator declined to identify the children, citing the wishes of family members. `` We do n't have a motive yet,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Palardy </PERSON> told reporters at the scene of the shootings. `` It looks like some sort of disaster in there. A man appears to have gone berserk and started shooting.'' The gunman, identified as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON>, in his 40s, died at 4:10 p.m. of gunshot wounds, said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Francois </PERSON>, assistant director of nursing at <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` The person that was involved, for whatever reason, became very antagonistic when he returned home this afternoon,'' said West Orange Mayor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Spina </PERSON>, who visited the scene. Two witnesses, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, said they saw teen-age boys tossing stones at <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> earlier Saturday while he was driving in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, which borders West Orange. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> left his car to confront the youths, and one of the teen-agers punched him in the face and threatened him. The three children who were shot apparently had no connection to the earlier incident, the witnesses said. Police said they had heard reports of that incident but would not say whether it was a motive in the shooting. One neighbor, a 15-year resident who said he went fishing regularly with the gunman, said <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> had been physically and verbally harassed recently by teen-age boys in an increasingly drug-infested neighborhood. `` His mind probably just snapped,'' said the neighbor, who added that he would not give his name for fear of an attack on his family by neighborhood youths. `` He's a nice guy. ... It's a shame this had to happen to him.'' One witness, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gress </PERSON>, who lives across an intersection from the apartment building in this <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suburb, said he was playing solitaire in his home shortly before 3 p.m. when he heard gunfire that `` sounded like firecrackers.'' <PERSON> Gress </PERSON> said when he looked outside, he saw a young boy by a parked car across the street screaming, `` The guy's a maniac.'' <PERSON> Gress </PERSON> said he then saw a police car pull up to the corner, and the gunman started shooting at the cruiser. He went to telephone police and when he returned to the window, the gunman was lying on the ground and the police officer also lay wounded on the ground. The police officer, who works for the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, was not seriously injured, <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said. He was admitted in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON>. The officer was on a routine patrol of the neighborhood, which lies on the border of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> and the city of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, when he heard the gunshots and went to the scene, <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Palardy </PERSON> said the identity of the officer was not immediately available. <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> first started shooting at a woman in a first floor apartment, and police believe the gun misfired, allowing the woman time to run into the bathroom. The gunman then shot a child in the apartment and went outside, where he shot two more children, <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said. The police officer hit the gunman with four rounds, officials Residents of the neighborhood said crime there has worsened recently, with older people forced to live in fear of drug-related violence. `` The young teen-agers are jumping people all the time,'' said <PERSON> Deidra </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggest </PERSON>, a 25-year-old resident who has lived in the area for eight months. `` Houses are getting robbed and cars are getting stolen.'' `` It's getting worse all the time,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorham </PERSON>, 26, who has lived in the area for six months. `` It's crazy out there.''

 Boating accidents Saturday left two boys missing and presumed drowned in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and another critically injured near <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, authorities said. In <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, police saw two youths jump into the water from a boat in <LOCATION> Mashapaug </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION> and try to swim to shore just as a thunderstorm began pelting the area with rain, according to a police spokesman, Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Verrechia </PERSON>. A bystander jumped into the water and began swimming toward one of the youths and was joined by a police officer, but the boy went beneath the surface before the men could reach him, <PERSON> Verricchia </PERSON> said. The other boy, who was about 25 yards beyond the first, went beneath the water as a uniformed officer and an off-duty police officer climbed aboard the youths' boat and paddled towards him, the spokesman said. Divers called off the search after four hours, but were expected to resume Sunday morning, <PERSON> Verrechia </PERSON> said. No one had reported the boys missing and their identities were not known, he said. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a boy suffered multiple cuts to his head and chest after he fell off a jet ski and was run over by a boat driven by teen-agers in the <LOCATION> Intracoastal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Waterway </LOCATION>, authorities said. <PERSON> Ami </PERSON> <PERSON> Missika </PERSON>, 5, was hit at about 3:30 p.m. EST after he fell into the water in north <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, authorities said.

 An armed man who police say had been hospitalized recently for depression was holding his girlfriend, her sister and the girlfriend's 4-year-old daughter hostage late Saturday. Heavily armed police remained in position around a one-story home where <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> `` Dougie'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 20, was holding the three hostages. A fourth hostage, the 2 -LCB- - month-old daughter of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and his girlfriend, was released in the morning, pushed out of the house wrapped in a quilt, police said Police blocked off streets leading to the house and evacuated about 32 families about five hours after receiving the first reports of the disturbance late Friday. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> was reportedly armed with a handgun and threatened to kill himself and the hostages. Twice during the day he fired shots inside the house, but he allowed the hostages to talk to police each time to show they had not been harmed, police said. `` We're just going to wait,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>. `` Right now, everything is under control.'' Police spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> had made no specific demands but he repeatedly asked to talk to friends and relatives by telephone. `` He seems like he's almost hallucinating,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> was hospitalized recently for depression and apparently had been taking medication that might affect his mood. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, a friend who talked to Thomas by telephone during the afternoon, described him as `` paranoid and insecure.'' Although <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> refused to identify him, relatives, friends and other police sources confirmed <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' identity, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Springfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Register </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> spent a year in prison for aggravated battery for shooting two men at a dance in 1985, the newspaper reported.

 Police stormed a townhouse early today and freed two children who had been held hostage for more than a day by a blind prison escapee and an accomplice. One of the two captors was shot dead in the attack, police said. A special weapons and tactics team rescued <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, 8, and his 6-year-old sister, Cameo, unharmed around 1:30 a.m. this morning, police Capt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> said. They had been held since Friday afternoon. Police threw a stun grenade into the house when one of the children came out to pick up drinks the authorities had arranged to deliver, Capt. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. Police shot one of the captors when he grabbed the girl at knifepoint, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. Police would not immediately identify whether inmate <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> or his accomplice, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, had been killed, pending notification of relatives. The other captor was taken into custody, police said. `` Basically, they said they had to be allowed to leave. If they did n't, they were going to throw a dead child out,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. The children's grandmother, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, had pleaded to the gunmen on television Saturday night. `` Please <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>, please let them go,'' she said. `` Stop and think. They are very innocent.'' Earlier Saturday, police seized the children's mother, <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, when she left the house at 10:30 a.m. to start a car in what police described as an escape attempt by the two men. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> was taken to a hospital for treatment of exhaustion and stress. Police Chief <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> said he did not know whether <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>'s role in the incident was willing or unwilling, but said she offered no resistance when officers prevented her from going back into the building because of concern over her children `` We just plain stopped her. We did n't let her back inside,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. `` It was a decision we had to make. We could not allow her back in when we had a hostage out.'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> had corresponded with <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> in prison, but her sister-in-law, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, said she broke off the relationship more than 18 months ago when she discovered <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was a convicted murderer. Police had negotiated with the men throughout the day as SWAT officers ringed the building. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a blind inmate at <ORGANIZATION> Stillwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, escaped from a medical office Friday morning while he was being escorted by two guards to an appointment for a replacement glass eye. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> had been met at the office by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who had a handgun, officers said. The two men disarmed the guards, tied one of them up and fled, police said. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 49, was convicted of second-degree murder for strangling his girlfriend in 1982 and was serving his fifth prison stint, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowdle </PERSON>, associate warden at the <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> prison. He has other convictions for two counts of rape, as well as robbery, criminal sexual assault, burglary and illegal handgun possession. Police have identified his accomplice as a former <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> inmate, Capt. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure it was all prearranged,'' he said.

 Soldiers and leftist guerrillas fought near a power station on the outskirts of the capital early Sunday, several hours before voting began in the presidential election. Elsewhere, soldiers shot three local journalists at military checkpoints, killing two of them, officials said.

The sounds of the pre-dawn battle could be heard in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Afterward, military helicopters circled overhead, occasionally firing rockets at rebel positions.

 Thousands of supporters of maverick communist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> marched through downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Sunday and vowed to hold a general strike if he does not win election next week to the new national parliament. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who was ousted as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss after criticizing the pace of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, claims the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party machine is working to defeat him. For many Soviets, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> epitomizes the quest for more democracy and an end to special privilege for the government and party elite. Chanting `` <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>! <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>!'' at least 3,000 Muscovites set off from <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> after they were refused permission to hold a pro-Yeltsin election rally there. They marched to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> City Hall after scores of uniformed police sealed off <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> <PERSON> Prospekt </PERSON> leading to the Kremlin. At city hall, the protesters demanded a meeting with <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON>, the official who replaced <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> as the Soviet capital's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> boss in November 1987, and who is in charge of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party machine they claim is trying to engineer <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s A city official armed with a bullhorn clambered on top of a bus to demand that the crowd disperse, but it remained in front of the municipal building for more than two hours. One pro-Yeltsin speaker perched beside the city hall door called on the crowd to approve a general strike if <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> does not win the right to represent <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the March 26 elections for the <ORGANIZATION> Congerss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, and the protesters raised their hands in agreement. It was not immediately clear when the strike would take place. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> released a transcript of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s remarks at a private <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting in 1987 that cost him his job as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss. The transcript said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the gathering that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had become the object of `` intolerable'' glorification. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was named <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief in December 1985 and a non-voting Politburo member two months later. He lost both posts as a result of his remarks at the Oct. 21, 1987 meeting. The party said it was publishing a transcript of the meeting in its new monthly journal, News of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, because of requests by workers and party members. But a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> specialist said the release of 40 pages of scathing attacks on <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other leaders appeared designed to hurt the 58-year - old <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> in his bid for political office The transcript showed <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> criticized not only <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who brought him into the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership, but <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, a conservative force on the ruling Politburo.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still talks about wanting to build a `` kinder-gentler'' nation, but many of the groups keeping an eye on the new president are taking a wait-and-see attitude on whether he translates words into results. The president has made several strides to demonstrate his commitment to a government that is more compassionate to those in need, and more attuned to such issues as the environment, minority concerns and women. He often describes that aspect of his administration by reviving a phrase he used in the campaign when he pledged to make a `` kinder-gentler'' nation. In that vein, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week submitted to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> his legislative proposal for child care _ a plan that would give a tax credit or refund of up to $ 1,000 per child to low-income people. He also proposed a 29 percent increase in spending for the homeless, to $ 645 million next year. He recently spoke about how he was disturbed by the sight of homeless people huddled on the grounds near the White House. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tempered his opposition to federal gun control and bucked the displeasure of his fellow <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> members by halting the imports of semiautomatic assault guns until their usage can be reviewed. These and other actions give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a boost simply by comparison with his predecessor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whose record was considered distinctly not kinder or gentler by such groups as women, minorities and environmentalists. But these groups are reserving judgment. Some are waiting for more dramatic leadership, and others, including the environmentalists are waiting to see the fine print that goes with his positive sounding rhetoric on such issues as acid rain. `` He deserves an A for a new tone,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the two-time democratic presidential candidate who has developed a friendly relationship with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and who has visited with the president at the White House. He said the access <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has given to people who felt locked out of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has been `` very positive.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has set `` the right tone but not enough boldness in a right direction,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> contended. `` Now the question comes to a test of leadership. It must be bold, it must take a direction that will remedy fundamental problems.'' <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, president of the liberal lobbying organization Citizen Action, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` rhetoric is wonderful'' and that some of his actions have been what she called a welcome break from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. `` I am giving him credit for understanding there's a new progressive opening,'' in the country, she said, but added, `` I have n't seen a substantive set of proposals that are convincing in being able to rise to the challenges.'' Some complain that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, or those around him, often as not have undermined some of the very kinder-gentler signals he has sent. Some examples: _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cheered environmentalists when he indefinitely postponed offshore oil leasing key environmental tracts off <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> But environmentalists were dismayed that he failed one of their highest priority litmus tests when his <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> announced the administration will allow oil exploration in the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>. _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for banning of ozone-depleting chloroflourocarbons by the end of this century, but that was a position that was already advocated by many other nations, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was seen as `` playing catchup,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoel </PERSON>, senior attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> `` It was n't so much that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was anti-environmental as that he did n't have his act together,'' he said. `` He indicated he was going to be an environmental leader and so far there's been very little environmental leadership shown.'' _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed an increase in the minimum wage to $ 4.25, but coupled it with a lower so-called training wage for first-time workers And he angered labor activists by refusing to intervene in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike. _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cast a well-publicized and wide net to draw more women into his administration He named two women to his Cabinet, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>. But he has disappointed feminists by lunching at a private all-male club and joining in the merriment at the annual men-only <ORGANIZATION> Alfalfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> dinner. _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a strong pitch throughout the pre-inaugural period and in the first two weeks of his presidency for the highest ethical standards in the people he appointed to his administration That message was somewhat diluted when Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and White House Counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> both voluntarily disentangled themselves from financial affairs that became the subject of news stories. Neither was engaged in illegality, but said they did not want to permit any appearance of impropriety. Administration spokesman insist the kinder-gentler concept is not on the back burner even though it often is overshadowed by day-to-day events. `` We look for opportunities for getting out any of the messages he's trying to get across,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> communications Director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Demarest </PERSON>. `` We'll see more kinder-gentler. We'll see more of the entirety of the program.'' For her part, first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has had no trouble making a kinder-gentler image a big part of her White House life. Her first public event outside the White House was a visit to a daycare center for homeless children. In addition to her longtime promotion of literacy efforts, she has visited soup kitchens, nursing homes, and a schoolchildren's celebration of black history month. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has set up a foundation to raise money for literacy programs.

<HEAD>Spring is Here: The Weather is Changing, So Are The People</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The long, dreary wait for the end of winter is nearing its end as nature gradually edges into change. Human patience, also nearing its limits with winter, can draw encouragement from the spring equinox Monday. While the change of seasons is a gradual, often fitful thing, calendars usually list the solstices and equinoxes as unofficial markers of these transitions. `` The first day of spring is one thing, and the first spring day is another,'' observed the late <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>, aware that March weather can be fickle and also that the change of seasons can occur at markedly different dates in different parts of the nation. Even so, millions will welcome spring at 10:28 a.m. EST, the moment of the vernal equinox, when the sun crosses the equator on its apparent journey northward, according to astronomers at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Observatory in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. This, and the autumnal equinox in September, are the only two dates on which the sun rises directly in the east and sets precisely in the west, the Observatory reports. These directions were used to align the Great Pyramids in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> with an error equivalent to the thickness of a piece of string seen at a distance of six feet, said observatory spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleere </PERSON>. Ancient graves in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and temples in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> are also aligned to the equinoxes, she said. For the human mind, too, the change may be a point of alignment. `` Spring is a transition season when things change very rapidly,'' observed the late <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Landsberg </PERSON>, professor emeritus of meteorology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>. `` One major thing is apparently the change in light ... the most rapid increase in light intensity occurs between February and April,'' <PERSON> Landsberg </PERSON> explained, and this seems to affect human glands and internal reactions. Other fluctuations causing humans to react include `` rapid temperature changes in many places, sometimes highly irregular, changing from low to high to high to low again,'' said <PERSON> Landsberg </PERSON>, who researched the biological effects of weather. Poets and philosophers have lauded spring over the centuries with a curious mixture of cheer and woe, reflecting the differing reactions of humans to the stress of changing weather. As <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> observed of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s weather, `` it gets through more business in spring than in any other season. I have counted 136 different kinds of weather inside of 24 hours.'' This places stress on the body and, scientists are beginning to believe, the mind also. Human responses vary. Malaise, romance and even depression are among the reactions to these seasonal changes _ although so-called spring fever has been most widely identified with that vague feeling of disinterest, mind-wandering and restlessness. Nature writer <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Borland </PERSON> reflected on the seasonal change in the book `` Twelve Moons of the Year:'' `` There is something in a mild March day that can touch a man to the very quick of his being. Just what it is can not readily be stated, but it must be compounded of sunlight and air and warmth and an immeasurable mystery that is partly summed up by the word ` promise.''' `` When the first warm days of spring come, we all feel a desire to escape, to run away. It becomes difficult to concentrate on serious matters, and we experience indefinable, vague yearnings that disturb our psychic balance and have a bad influence on our professional activities,'' wrote Dr. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauquelin </PERSON>, a French psychologist, in his book `` How Atmospheric Conditions Affect Your Health.'' `` Spring is a period when new romances start, when fresh plans are made ... But it is also a season when people experience frequent changes of mood and have bitter arguments with one another,'' <PERSON> Gauquelin </PERSON> wrote. His volume attributes people's response to `` spring hormonal crisis,'' when the endocrine glands are more active and sexual interest heightened. Whether the changes are the result of hormones, sunlight or other factors, nearly everyone observes and reacts to them. German studies in the 1960s found that most illegitimate conceptions tended to occur in May which, the researchers suggested, `` seems to indicate that spring may well be the season for all forms of impulsive behavior.'' On the darker side, French sociologist <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Durkheim </PERSON> noted a half-century ago that suicides increase in the spring. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> studied the nation's suicide rates between 1969 and 1978 and found that during that decade `` the suicide pattern was distinctly seasonal, above average all spring and below average all winter.''

 Here at a glance are some facts, figures and issues related to Sunday's presidential election:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE INCUMBENT _ President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who suffers from terminal liver cancer, was elected in 1984 and can not by law succeed himself. He steps down June 1; his successor will serve a five-year term.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE CONTENDERS _ Seven candidates were running, including: <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or Arena; <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON> of the leftist Democratic Convergence. Four minor party candidates were not expected to be significant factors. If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff election will be held in April.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE ISSUES _ The main issues were ending a nine-year civil war that has cost 70,000 lives, and restarting a stagnant economy that suffers high unemployment and is heavily dependent on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE BOYCOTT _ The rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> called for an election boycott, saying political solutions are impossible without participation by the rebels and the social and political forces they represent. The guerrillas paralyzed most highway traffic, sabotaged electricity, telephones and water, and called on election workers to quit. But they said they would not retaliate against those who wished to vote in defiance of the boycott.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE VOTERS _ About 1.8 million Salvadorans are registered; the nation's population is more than 5 million. Voting began at 7 a.m. and ended by 5 p.m. There are 260 municipalities, but 24 were controlled by the rebels and no voting was scheduled.

 Soviet leaders warned last year that their definition of democracy might be a bit different from the Western one. So far, they're right. As the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> lurches toward its first multicandidate elections, it is clear that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms have brought amazing latitude in public debate to a country that punished unorthodox ideas with harsh prison terms just a few years ago. Now, even the evils of democracy are taking seed in this changing landscape. Political neophytes are battling entrenched <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials using classic tactics of election rigging: They pack caucus halls with hand-picked voters, bar electors from holding nomination meetings by denying them a hall, or simply toss candidates off the ballot. Traditional authoritarianism is entangled with the new freedoms. Two weeks ago, <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> activists were detained for distributing dangerous literature _ which turned out to be copies of the election law. At meetings during the campaign for the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, passions run wild Across the country, tens of thousands of people are seizing microphones and the opportunity to speak out on everything from human rights to snow removal. On Sunday, at least 3,000 people marched in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to back <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, an independent candidate. One recent caucus debate ran 13 hours, yet only 13 of 888 people had left by 3 a.m., said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> election official <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON>. Despite the publicity over the multicandidate elections, one in four districts has only one name on the ballot. Many of the unopposed candidates are local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chiefs. `` It's just the same as 10 years ago, in the <LOCATION> Brezhnev </LOCATION> era: one candidate for each district, and each one a power in the party,'' complains <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Deravyankin </PERSON>, an independent <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> member from the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Saratov </LOCATION>. Still, new ideas are holding sway. Newspapers have exposed hundreds of cases of `` non-democratic'' behavior. Citizens have flooded the national commission overseeing the elections with more than 77,000 complaints. And reformers are discovering political tricks of their own. `` There are dozens of violations of the letter of the law,'' acknowledged election commission deputy <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Golovko </PERSON> at a recent news conference. The law itself will be revised, he promised. At this point, it seems possible that the same men who run the country on the 12-member Communist Party Politburo could wind up controlling the key legislative committees in the new parliament. But it also seems possible the congress will be full of new faces determined to make the Soviet government responsive to the public. The candidates include former political prisoners; <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> historian and party outcast <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>; reform economist <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON>, who disclosed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s huge deficit; <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristen </PERSON>; environmental activists; and the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, according to a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat tracking the election. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the pugnacious former <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> chief who was demoted in November 1987 after stepping on toes with an anti-corruption campaign, is running for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> seat against organized party opposition. As always, though, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dominates. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News found 82 percent of the candidates are party members. The law itself is partly to blame for the manipulation, some people complain. Since a third of the deputies are being elected by certain public organizations, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member who also belongs to the Union of Writers and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> can participate in all three of those elections and vote in his residential district as well. Election caucuses can legally slash the number of candidates, and they have often rejected reformers. Nuclear physicist and human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, for example, was nominated by 60 research institutes, but the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidium </ORGANIZATION> rejected him in favor of a slate of old guard managers. In many of the public organizations, there is even less choice, because leaders bar rank-and-file members from voting. The Communist Party itself set the tone when it took 31,000 names and boiled them down to 100 candidates _ for 100 seats. Moreover, even if reformers manage to win a place in the 2,250-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies in March 26 voting, they still may not wield much power. No official date has been announced for the body's first session. But the law calls for it to meet just one day a year _ to elect the real, working parliament with fewer than 500 members. A <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> majority in the congress could easily elect only its own members to the real positions of legislative power.

<HEAD>House To Consider Legislation On Minimum Wage, Protecting Whistleblowers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is making one of its slowest starts in recent memory as it heads toward April with little accomplished but a series of bruising internal battles. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be on a two-week Easter break starting Monday, but before leaving Friday it confirmed Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> as defense secretary. The non-controversial ratification was a breeze after the bitter struggle over President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first choice for the job, former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>. The rejection of Tower by a 53-47 vote, largely along party lines, handed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a major defeat and absorbed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for nearly two months. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which does n't start its Easter break until Friday, faces floor votes this week on raising the minimum wage and legislation protecting whistleblowers _ government workers who report corruption within their own agencies. House members also may this week get a report from the <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. The 12-member committee, which undertook the inquiry into the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat's financial dealings nine months ago, began deliberating last week on whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> broke House rules. Their investigation coupled with the ill-fated fight to raise congressional pay, and now a search among Republican members for a minority whip, have sidetracked <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> action on any major legislation so far this session. House Republicans are expected to choose Wednesday between two candidates vying for the number two leadership post. Reps. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> are competing to succeed <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, who resigned last week after being confirmed as defense secretary. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> is the leader of an activist conservative wing of the party while <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, currently the deputy whip, is regarded as a pragmatist who would probably be more willing to work with the Democrats to win support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s programs. The House is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a bill to expand the rights of federal employees who blow the whistle on fraud. The measure sailed through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday, 97-0, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised to sign it after the House completes its work. Similar legislation was the subject of one of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s most controversial vetoes The legislation would lower the burden of proof for whistleblowers who claim they have been punished by their employers for disclosing misdeeds within their agencies, and increase the burden of proof for the federal agencies defending their decisions. House floor debate over the minimum wage is expected to begin Wednesday, with Democrats seeking an increase from $ 3.35 to $ 4.65 by 1992. Republicans are supporting the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal that minimum wages raise only to $ 4.25 by 1992, with a provision that employers be allowed to pay new workers $ 3.35 for the first six months. The minimum wage has not increased since 1981. Budget negotiators from both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are to exchange offers this week, with Democrats expected to push for military cuts equal to domestic spending cuts in the fiscal 1990 budget. Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., planned to work together in drafting a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> budget In addition to the balance between domestic and military spending cuts, <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said he wants new revenues to equal the overall spending cuts. Also this week, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> banking subcommittee will hold the last of more than three dozen congressional hearings on the savings and loan crisis, listening a final time to <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> before writing a $ 100 billion bailout plan. Banking committees in both houses, using <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal as the foundation but possibly altering many of its key provisions, plan to put the actual bailout package together the first week <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is back in session after Easter.

<TEXT>
 A major government advisory conference convened Sunday with speakers urging unity in solving <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s growing economic problems, setting the tone for a legislative session that opens Monday. The brief and businesslike opening session of the 2,081-member <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> emphasized working together under the leadership of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The somber theme was in sharp contrast to the conference's last full meeting in April 1988, which saw unprecedented lively debate and calls for democracy. Since then, however, overheated economic growth has produced chronic shortages, widespread corruption and annual inflation of 36 percent, causing a slowdown in both economic and political reforms. Conference Chairman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON> urged the delegates to share the government's concerns, offer their suggestions and dedicate themselves to finding solutions. Vice Chairman <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Weichang </PERSON>, who delivered a 13-page work report, called on the delegates to `` be ceaselessly diligent'' in pushing forward the government's economic policies. The speeches were greeted with only perfunctory applause by the delegates who attended the 80-minute session in the Great Hall of the People in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The conference draws delegates from among scientists, scholars, writers and official organizations. Its annual plenary session, scheduled to last 10 days, is always timed to coincide with the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature The congress begins its 16-day session Monday. Officials reportedly have attempted to discourage unwelcome debate and criticism of government policies at both meetings this year because of concern that the economic problems could trigger social instability. Conference official <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Siyuan </PERSON> reported that delegates have made more than 2,000 suggestions to the government since their last full meeting, and that more than a quarter of these have been adopted. But he gave no details about the nature of the suggestions. He said delegates have been briefed from time to time by officials on government policy and helped carry it out, especially by joining in efforts to police prices and cut back on wasteful construction projects. The speakers' clear message was that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s increasingly restive intellectuals can best serve the country by using their talents to implement party decisions rather than questioning or criticizing them. The opening session was attended by senior party and government leaders, including General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>.

 The political wounds of a 10-year-old sexual assault allegation have been reopened for Mayor <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> with a city council probe and filing of a lawsuit that could mean the end of his hopes of running for governor. <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> treasurer, a rising star in the local <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1978, when his children's 13-year-old baby sitter accused him of sexually assaulting her while she slept on a couch in <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>'s home. He has denied the allegation and a grand jury failed to indict him. But a newspaper story last fall resulted in the council investigation and one by the police department into whether a police officer spied on the girl's family in 1983 in an attempt to discredit her and gain a police endorsement for <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>, who was running for mayor. <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> did n't get the endorsement, but he won the election. He is now serving his second four-year term as mayor of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s capital city. <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>, 43, said he does not know how the resurrection of what has become known locally as `` the baby sitter incident'' will affect his political future, which he at one time had hoped would be spent in the governor's office. Once-plentiful rumors that <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> planned to run for governor in 1990 have died down since the investigations, despite an <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> poll in January that showed he had a 78 percent approval rating in the city of approximately 600,000. It was his highest rating ever. `` Part of me would love to -LRB- be governor -RRB-, but part of me says no. I've had a taste of politics that has not been good. The jury is still out in my heart and in my head,'' he said. The former baby sitter, <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON>, now 23, said she hopes <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>'s political future is indeed wounded. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> has any business being anywhere in politics, which includes governor,'' she said at a news conference on Wednesday. On Thursday _ two weeks after the council hearings _ Ms. <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON>'s stepmother, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON>, filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> against <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> and the police officer accused of spying, contending they engaged in a political conspiracy against the family In 1978, Ms. <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON> told police that she was asleep on <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>'s couch when she awoke to find him performing oral sex on her She contended he then kissed her on the mouth, said he would be back later and walked out of the room. Ms. <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON> later passed a police-administered polygraph test. <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>, who was advised by his lawyer not to submit to a police test, said he passed a privately administered polygraph test. For 10 years, questions have surrounded the propriety of a <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury hearing into Ms. <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON>'s allegations. <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> was allowed to testify before the grand jury _ an opportunity that is only rarely afforded the accused in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Also permitted to testify on <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>'s behalf was a psychiatric expert who told the jury that, although he had not interviewed Ms. <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON>, she may have dreamed the incident and believed it had actually happened. The grand jury declined to indict <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>. The `` baby sitter incident'' resurfaced last October when The Plain Dealer in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> reported that police officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a devoted <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> supporter, had conducted secret, politically motivated surveillance on the <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON> family for two months in 1983. After <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> was elected, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was promoted from the police force to deputy city safety director and then deputy city development director. He was fired after he refused to cooperate in a police investigation a few days after the Plain Dealer story. <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> says he knew nothing about <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s investigation or the officer's 13-page report of his findings until the newspaper queried <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> about it Oct. 7. He plays down the controversy surrounding <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s activities. `` We've had city employees who, unfortunately, have done things that are out of line. We've had worse stuff than this. We had a police officer who robbed banks,'' <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> said. The internal police investigation of <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION>, which ended in November, found no criminal activity, although police said their investigation was hampered by the fact that <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> refused to be interviewed. The findings of a council investigation _ which concluded March 2 after three days of testimony from <LOCATION> Rinehart </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> and others _ will be known next month. Testimony at the hearings raised questions about whether <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> knew of the report and who in the police department and his campaign may have authorized the surveillance. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who testified under a grant of immunity, said he conducted the surveillance with neither the knowledge nor permission of his superiors, <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>, or any member of the <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> campaign. `` I did n't feel they had a need to know,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. He testified that he researched the <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON> family's geneological history, recorded license numbers of mourners at the funeral of Miss <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON>'s father in 1983, and obtained information on the family's banking records without obtaining a subpoena _ an order required under federal bank right-to-privacy laws <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said he conducted the investigation on city time and used city equipment. <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>'s testimony that he did n't know about <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s report until last fall was contradicted by testimony from two local reporters, who told the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> they had confronted <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> with a copy of it in 1983. A third said he'd seen a copy of the report in 1983. The Pardue lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions ordering the defendants to halt any further investigation of the family. No hearing date was set.

<TEXT>
 A stalled aerial ride left about 150 persons dangling in the sky over <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> up to five hours while workers struggled to rescue them. The Skyway cable stopped Saturday, apparently after someone in one of the four-person gondolas began rocking their car vigorously, said <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McTyre </PERSON>. About 150 people were aboard the ride at the time. No injuries were reported during the shutdown and ensuing five-hour rescue effort, <PERSON> McTyre </PERSON> said. All the attractions in Fantasyland and several in <LOCATION> Tomorrowland </LOCATION> were closed because fire trucks had to maneuver underneath each car during the prolonged rescue effort. Firefighters used hydraulic lift equipment to rescue passengers, one by one, from gondolas suspended about 40 feet overhead. The gondola ride shut down automatically Saturday evening, the spokesman said. Riders had to be lowered to the amusement park floor by firefighters using extension equipment. `` Eyewitnesses reported one guest car being swung by a guest severely back and forth,'' <PERSON> McTyre </PERSON> said. `` We're speculating that's what triggered the Skyway safety system to shut down like it did. Firefighters from the <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and Garden Grove fire department assisted in the rescue effort, he said. `` The guests have all been calm and no one was injured,'' <PERSON> McTyre </PERSON> said. `` It's just been a big inconvenience, both for people stuck up in the air and those on the ground.'' No legal action was planned against the riders blamed for setting off the ride's emergency shutdown system, the spokesman said.

<HEAD>Raising The Minimum Wage Will Cost Taxpayers As Well As Employers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As business and labor argue over raising the minimum wage, the potential impact on the federal budget and major jobs programs has been virtually lost in the debate. That changes this week when the bitterly partisan debate reaches the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. Some say raising the minimum wage from its current $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.65 as proposed would have virtually no impact on the federal budget. Others argue it would cost the budget, and taxpayers, as much as $ 5 billion. Although most Democrats have downplayed any budget impact, an analysis prepared last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> for the Democratic sponsors of the legislation conceded that raising the minimum wage could cost the government money and possibly force cuts in at least four jobs programs. The nonpartisan <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> said it could not estimate the potential cost because of insufficient data. But a House Republican analysis estimates that if the Democrats' bill becomes law it would cost $ 570 million a year by 1992 to maintain current staffing levels in just those four programs, College Work Study, <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for Older Americans and the federal government's summer youth employment program Without that money, those programs will be forced to cut more than 435,000 jobs, with work study, the campus jobs often awarded as part of a student's financial aid package, accounting for half the total, according to the Republicans. `` Somebody must speak out on behalf of the victims of this legislation,'' Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said in an interview. `` The Democrats like to talk about these programs, but compassion without understanding can be cruel and wasteful.'' <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> tried unsuccessfully to amend the Democratic bill in committee last week to exempt the four programs from having to pay their workers any increase in the minimum wage. Only four fellow Republicans sided with <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> as the amendment was trounced. He promised to try again during floor debate. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legislation, said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> would support increased spending on the programs to save the jobs but opposes paying their workers less than the minimum wage The prospects of getting more money for the programs to offset the added payroll costs `` are between zero and none,'' countered <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, also a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Republicans are supporting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for a more modest increase, to $ 4.25 an hour by 1992, provided employers are allowed to pay new workers $ 3.35 an hour for six months. That would alleviate some of the cost to the government, the Republicans say. Their analysis did not include data on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan. White House estimates of the impact the Democratic minimum-wage bill would have on the budget range up to $ 5 billion. That figure came from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, which in a report to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said a higher minimum wage would cause an inflationary spiral in all wages and a subsequent hike in interest rates. It estimated those higher rates would result in the government having to pay from $ 2 billion to $ 5 billion in higher interest for the money it borrows. Two other topics have dominated the debate over the minimum wage _ whether a `` training wage'' should be included in the legislation and to what degree raising the minimum wage results in job losses. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insists his support hinges on raising the minimum no higher than $ 4.25 an hour with the accompanying provision allowing employers to pay the sub-minimum for six months. Democrats, apparently convinced they can not override a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto, have shown increased willingness to support some form of training wage and plan to tag such a provision onto the House bill this week. But it will require specific training, unlike <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, and have a far shorter life span than the six months espoused by the president. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was reviewing a handful of training wage proposals and, although he has been a staunch critic of the idea, will select one to add to his bill. `` He knows President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be there for four years and would accept a bonafide training wage,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. As for potential job losses, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration maintains the Democratic bill would cost 650,000 jobs by 1992 while the president's more modest proposal would cost about 200,000. The Democrats have assailed those figures, saying past increases in the minimum wage have not caused significant job losses. But the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, in a report sent to <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> on Friday, estimated that raising the minimum to $ 4.65 would cause a loss of from 125,000 to 250,000 jobs.

 Four black policemen were wounded when a hand grenade was hurled through the gates of a police training center in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, police said Sunday. No arrests were reported, and no one claimed responsibility for the Saturday night attack. Police have blamed similar past attacks on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. Police said 19 black youths were arrested after attackers firebombed a government building in a black township near the port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, also Saturday night. Officers fired tear gas, shotguns and pistols to disperse the bombers, and one youth was wounded, police headquarters said. In <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the main black township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, a mob caught a suspected rapist, and stoned and burned the man to death Saturday. Police confirmed the killing, and two newspapers published photographs of the burning body. In another development, anti-apartheid groups announced prayer services nationwide on Tuesday in support of detainees, particularly those staging hunger strikes to protest being held without charge.

<TEXT>
 More than 200 Afghan army troops defected with tanks and weapons to Moslem guerrillas, and another 37 soldiers were captured during fighting in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, insurgent sources claimed Sunday. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s state radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said Sunday that 215 guerrillas were killed and 64 others injured in the last 24 hours of fighting in the strategic eastern Afghan city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. It also said `` huge amounts of arms, including missiles, were seized.'' Neither the guerrilla or communist government claims could be independently verified. A spokesman for the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group said 43 officers and 165 enlisted men of the Afghan 18th Division defected to insurgents Tuesday about 72 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. They handed over 12 tanks, 38 ammunition trucks, long-range rockets and other military equipment, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoaib </PERSON> said from Jamiat's headquarters in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. He said the guerrillas also captured five government officers and 32 soldiers in attacks on communist security posts along the strategic <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> on March 10. The rebels control much of northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Panjshir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> road, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s main land route to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, runs through the valley. Soviet forces in February ended a nine-year intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> continues to send supplies to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s beleagured communist government. The communists maintain their hold on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s cities, but guerrillas control more than 90 percent of the countryside. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, Afghan authorities said two Pakistani military men, <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Afzal </PERSON>, were captured near <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, 300 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which backs the guerrillas, has denied any nationals are fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government radio reports said guerrillas fired several rockets into <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> on Sunday, killing three civilians and injuring 19, including eight communist troops. The radio claimed 214 guerrillas were killed and 64 people injured around the city in the last 24 hours. It gave no army casualties. Insurgents two weeks ago chose the city, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s third largest, for their first major offensive against the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government since the Soviet pullout. They captured a key garrison at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and breached airport defenses, but communist forces have stalled the advance with massive aerial and artillery bombardments. Hundreds on both sides are believed to have been killed and wounded since rebels began their attack on March 6. Pakistani officials say more than 10,000 civilians have fled the fighting to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which already shelters more than 3 million Afghan refugees. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> lies on a key road between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Observers believe its fall would be a major blow to the communists. Speaking in a news conference in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> Sunday, guerrilla leader <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said the insurgents favored a `` gradual fall of big cities in order to avoid massacre and genocide of the Afghan people.'' Guerrilla leaders have formed their own provisional Afghan government-in-exile, which would come from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to establish an Islamic republic if the communists fall.

<HEAD>China Condemns U.S., European Resolutions on Tibet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> condemned as `` interference'' separate resolutions by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> accusing <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> of human rights violations in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, official reports said Sunday. `` We express strong indignation and deep regret,'' the People's Daily said, quoting a harshly-worded statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> The legislative committee also lodged `` a strong protest'' Sunday against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resolution, the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. Similar resolutions in the past have become major points of friction between the two countries. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resolution `` blatantly supports a handful of separatists in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted the statement as saying. The committee Saturday condemned the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> resolution, which urged <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to lift martial law and called on European nations to help mediae the Tibetan problem. `` The Tibetan people are a member of the big family of the Chinese nation. Any attempt to internationalize the Tibetan question on the excuse of human rights is firmly opposed by the Chinese government and will never succeed,'' the statement said. Its strong language is in keeping with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy of harshly rejecting outside criticism of its actions in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, which it claims has been part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s territory since the 13th century. Many Tibetans say they enjoyed de facto independence before <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> communist troops entered in 1950. They accuse the Chinese of human rights violations and of trying to destroy <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s Buddhist-based culture The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed its resolution Thursday about the martial law <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> imposed March 8 after three days of anti-Chinese violence in the Tibetan capital, <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. At least 12 people were killed in the fourth bloody Tibetan-Chinese confrontation in the past 18 months. The Parliament also appealed to foreign ministers of the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to offer their mediation. `` We are firmly opposed to and will by no means accept'' such mediation, the Chinese statement said. `` No foreign government, organization or individual is allowed to meddle in the question of negotiations between the Chinese central government and the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>.'' The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> is a self-exile many Tibetans consider their temporal and spiritual leader. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which also acted Thursday, has approved non-binding resolutions in the past urging the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to pressure <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to end alleged human rights violations in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. Two days after <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> imposed martial law on <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement of concern, which <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> dismissed as interference. `` The Chinese government is entirely justified and above reproach in taking the necessary measures to uphold law and maintain order,'' the Chinese legislative committee said. It reiterated <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s willingness to hold talks with the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, but ruled out independence or autonomy for the remote region. `` We strongly demand that the European parliament immediately stop its interference in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs so as to prevent doing any harm to our bilateral relations,'' it said. It similarly warned the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to act in the `` interests of safeguarding Chinese-U. relations.''

 South African diplomats Sunday began their first official visit to post-revolutionary <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, arriving to discuss a southern African peace treaty and seek the release of a captured soldier, the state radio reported. The South Africans will be attending a meeting this week of a joint commission formed to monitor the treaty signed in December by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and halt aid to the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebel movement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in exchange for the phased withdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban troops assisting <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> stands for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>8 in 10 Americans Prefer Chemical Free Food; Half Would Pay More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An overwhelming majority of Americans say they would buy organically grown food if it cost the same as fruits and vegetables treated with pesticides or synthetic fertilizers and nearly half would pay more, according to a survey released Sunday. The strong preference for chemical-free fruits and vegetables showed up in a survey conducted even before the recent scare over poisoned grapes and apples treated with Alar. The <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poll </ORGANIZATION> conducted for Organic Gardening magazine found that 84.2 percent of those surveyed would choose organically grown food if given the choice, 11.6 percent would not and 4.2 percent were not sure. Perhaps more surprisingly, 49 percent said they would pay more for organic food, the poll showed. People with college degrees and those earning a household income of more than $ 35,000 are more likely to have eaten organic produce than those with less education or a lower income, the poll showed. Men under 50 who live in the West and have managerial or professional jobs are the most likely to have eaten organic food, according to the survey. People in the South are the least likely. The reason almost 60 percent of those surveyed gave for choosing organic was long-term health effects. The majority of those who have eaten organically grown fruits and vegetables said they taste better, have more nutritional value and are better for health. But while consumers may want to switch to organics, the problem is finding organically grown food. `` On the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and a few places on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> there are some supermarkets that have organic sections within their stores,'' said <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, executive editor of Organic Gardening magazine. `` But usually you have to go to speciality stores.'' She said her magazine's research shows the organic farmers' share of the $ 36 billion fruit and vegetable market is about $ 5 billion. Three states _ <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ have organic certification programs through which consumers are assured the grower does not use synthetic fertilizers or pesticides, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. Organic food usually costs 5 percent to 15 percent more and sometimes does n't look as picture perfect as other fruits and vegetables, she said. `` From my point of view it is a more realistic looking product,'' she said. `` Nature is not perfect.'' `` Organic produce got a bad reputation because the people growing it tried to do the marketing and they did n't know how to market it, but now growers work with marketing professionals,'' she said. The nationwide survey was based on 1,250 telephone interviews with randomly selected adults throughout the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> between Nov. 9 and Nov. 23, 1988. The sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. The poll was taken well before last week's temporary ban of Chilean fruit because two grapes had been injected with the poison cyanide. It also came before the most recent flap over use on apples of Alar, a chemical that aides ripening and helps preserve crispness, that resulted in some schools banning apples from their menus. There has been a high-profile campaign against Alar, including an appeal last week by actress Meryl Streep in a well-publicized appearance before a congressional committee. However, Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> joined other federal officials over the weekend in attempting to assure the public it is safe to eat apples. `` I wish to send a message to mothers across the country: ` It's Mom, apples are good for your kids! said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>. He noted that only 5 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apple crop was treated with Alar in 1988. Food and Drug Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> has said that, even in those apples sprayed with Alar, the level is no more than 10 percent the level found acceptable under <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> regulations.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> stressed the link between Easter and youth during an open-air Palm Sunday Mass in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square attended by about 60,000 people marking the opening of Holy Week On a sunny morning, the pope blessed the palms and _ carrying a <LOCATION> palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> branch </LOCATION> _ led a procession to the altar on the steps of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica for a Mass commemorating <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s entry into <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. At the end of the ceremony, the pope offered greetings to young people in several languages and blessed sick and disabled people in the front rows. In separate remarks, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said there is a special connection between youth and Easter, which is celebrated on Sunday and marks the resurrection of Christ. `` How can one not see in youth and its values _ life, health, beauty, physical vigor, enthusiasm, joy _ almost a forerunner of the triumph of the resurrected <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and his glorious return?'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in Italian. He said youths must work toward `` the victory over sin ... that victory over evil, of which your inner life and your own physical being are such a beautiful symbol.'' The theme of youth was also stressed Saturday evening when the pope joined 10,000 young people at a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> concert by Italian pop singer <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Battiato </PERSON>. It was the first time a pop singer had performed at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>.

 Thousands of students and workers cheered calls Sunday by dissident leaders for the ouster of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and the immediate withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the main dissident alliance, told a rally of 5,000 people at <ORGANIZATION> Hanyang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> that opposition forces must unite to defeat the government in a pending national referendum. `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' and `` Yankee go home!'' protesters chanted. Some students hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police in a brief clash after the rally. Police fired volleys of tear gas that drove protesters back. Thousands of riot police had surrounded the school, but there was little trouble after alliance leaders urged people to disperse peacefully. Police officials reported no arrests or injuries. Alliance chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bu-yong </PERSON> told the rally <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was a front for military rule. `` We can not suffer any more under the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> regime. We must oust the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> regime without fail,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-wan </PERSON>, another leading dissident, denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for supporting the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government and charged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was trying to control <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> like a colony. `` The real culprit is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The son of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s last king for the first time recognized the republic, renewing a campaign for him and his son to be allowed to return from a 43-year exile despite a constitutional ban, media reports said Sunday. In a letter to Italian president <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> published in Italian newspapers, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> wrote from exile in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> that he is not, however, renouncing his claim to the former throne of the House of Savoy. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON>, 51, wrote the letter Saturday, the sixth anniversary of the death of his father, King Umberto II. `` I want to do today what my father was not in a position to do, and that is to recognize this incontrovertible reality that is the Italian republic,'' he wrote. He said he was appealing especially on behalf of his 17-year-old son, <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Filiberto </PERSON>, whom he hoped would be allowed to attend an Italian military academy and university. The letter sparked immediate speculation that <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> was relinquishing his claim to the throne, but he quickly denied that was the case. `` I want to return to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> as soon as possible,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` I say simply that I recognize the republic because it's there. I will never, never renounce my royal prerogatives. I am totally monarchist.'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> has appealed in the past for the government to allow his family to return. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s 1947 constitution, however, bans the entry of <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> and his heirs from the country and would need a two-thirds majority in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to be altered. <PERSON> Umberto </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> reigned for 26 days before being forced into exile in 1946, when Italians voted by a slim margin to abolish the monarchy. <PERSON> Umberto </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1983 at the age of 78. In 1987, the government lifted the constitutional ban on the entry of his widow, the ex-queen <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>. She has since returned to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> on a few occasions, but continues to live in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The House of Savoy ruled <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> for nine centuries and its kings reigned in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> from 1861 to 1946.

 The pilot laughed when asked why he is willing to risk his job in the showdown between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its unions. `` For five years, every time the little guy with the rifle walked by, he made me bow down,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerndt </PERSON>. `` I came out of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> with my head held up, and I'm not going to spend the rest of my life looking down when I pass other pilots.'' He is among the 3,400 Eastern pilots who stunned management by joining the March 4 walkout by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. He's also a former prisoner of war. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> 1st Lt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerndt </PERSON>, piloting an F-4 Phantom fighter on a bombing mission to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, was shot down Aug. 23, 1967. Five years and five months later, <PERSON> Gerndt </PERSON> was flown out of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> transport plane. He carried with him the wounds of years of torture and mistreatment that led to broken ribs, damaged joints, hepatitis and repeated bouts with dysentery. He also carried out a changed philosophy of life. `` Little things in life do n't bother you so much,'' said <PERSON> Gerndt </PERSON>, 46. `` You want to stand up and be counted if someone is trying to take advantage of people and trying to force his ideas and views on them.'' Eastern, which had hoped to keep at least 25 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily flights during the strike, is struggling to maintain 10 percent, with the walkout well into its third week. The executives put in place three years ago by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> admitted they badly overestimated the number of pilots who would keep flying Only about 200 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots have crossed the picket lines. Pilots often have ignored the picket lines of other airline unions, but the Eastern pilots say they learned from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> pilots, who lost their union along with the Machinsts in 1983 even though the pilots did n't honor picket lines. The pilots also say they believe that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> also owns <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, is bent on stripping Eastern of its assets while chipping away at employees' pay and work conditions. Pilots union spokesman <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said another key to understanding the Eastern pilots' resolve is that 75 percent or more are military veterans, many with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> experience. `` One of the problems is this management has been trying to use intimidation and coercion,'' said <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, a B-52 pilot who flew <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> combat missions in 1969. `` It speaks to the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> philosophy and shows how badly he misunderstands these pilots. `` These people know what it really is to be afraid; they've put their lives on the line in a hostile environment,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. `` If I survived <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, I damn sure am not going to be concerned about a guy putting memos on a bulletin board.'' <PERSON> Gerndt </PERSON> said as much as he loves flying and the lifestyle of a pilot for a major carrier, the job's not worth giving in to `` demeaning management.'' He recounted his <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> experience last week, talking by telephone from his <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> financial consulting office where he works when not walking picket lines. He was in one of the first bombing missions into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> when he was shot down. <PERSON> Gerndt </PERSON> and his co-pilot ejected about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and he could hear bullets pinging the parachute's canopy as he fell. They were captured when they landed, stripped of their clothes and marched to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. Most of his imprisonment was in the infamous `` Hanoi Hilton.'' `` It started as soon as I got there. It was just like everything you ever heard about: beatings, ` rope tricks' where they tie you up and put stress on different joints, like a variation of the rack. `` At times you wonder if you will die there. But you have to have hope. That's all you have left,'' <PERSON> Gerndt </PERSON> said. He was freed in January 1973 as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was winding down, and by that August, he was flying for Eastern. Shortly afterward he was laid off because of cutbacks because of the energy crisis, and he got an MBA from <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gerndt </PERSON> said his Eastern salary is below the $ 70,000 to $ 75,000 average the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimates Eastern pilots earn annually. He said given the education and skills the pilots have, they resent <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and other managers' efforts to put them `` near the bottom of the barrel'' in the industry. `` Basically, I look at it that he's trying to destroy -LRB- employees' -RRB- way of living,'' <PERSON> Gerndt </PERSON> said. `` Why would I want to work for a man like that?''

 Thousands of Soviets took to the streets Sunday to accuse the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of sabotaging <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s election campaign and to threaten a general strike if the maverick reformer fails to win office. The march through downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by 3,000 Soviets chanting `` Hands off <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>!'' was an extraordinary outburst of passions aroused by Sunday's election for a new national parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. Security forces did not halt the march, even though it violated a regulation requiring that authorities receive prior notice. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 58, is running to represent the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> capital, where he headed the local party apparatus for almost two years before President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> fired him. At pre-election meetings and in a televised debate with his opponent, automobile factory manager <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, the stocky, white-haired <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has charged the party machine he once led of conspiring against his candidacy and restricting voters' access to his campaign appearances. Thousands of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> supporters planned to rally after noon Sunday at southwestern <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where a Russian folklore festival was under way. When they were told permission for the meeting had been refused, they set off for the city's downtown. Their anger was also kindled by a recent decision of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, announced Thursday, to form a special commission to investigate charges that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who is still a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member, opposes some party policies The high-level campaign against <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> appeared to enter another phase Sunday when the daily newspaper of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s party and government printed an account about <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s character and politics. The newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Moskovskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>, said it was a `` myth'' he was more faithful to principles than others. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> won the hearts and support of many Muscovites with a campaign against corruption and spirited attacks on the privileges, from special food stores to chauffeured limousines, available to the government and party elite. `` He's against the party mafia, and that's why the party mafia is against him,'' declared one marcher on Sunday, <PERSON> Taras </PERSON> <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON>, 65, a retired engineer. `` <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> is with the people, and for the people.'' The demonstrators, who carried a hand-painted banner reading `` Yes to <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, no to the bureaucratic system!'' glued pro-Yeltsin posters to the walls of buildings along their route, including the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and called on passers-by to join them. On <LOCATION> Kalinin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prospekt </LOCATION>, scores of gray-uniformed police officers, backed up by <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents in plainclothes, barred the way to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, the seat of Soviet power. The marchers, including teen-agers and people in their 60s, then marched past the headquarters of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> and arrived at <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s major shopping thoroughfare. Police and <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents along the route channeled the marchers, but made no attempt to halt them, even though their protest violated <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city regulations that require seven days' notice of any demonstration. The street resounded with the chant of `` Hands off <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>!'' as the marchers approached the five-story, red-and-white columned building that serves as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s City Hall. There, another cordon of police and yellow buses parked across the avenue barred their way. In unison, the protesters brandished their fists and chanted their demand to meet with <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON>, a member of the ruling party Politburo who succeeded <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss in November 1987, and who leads the party machine <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> claims is working for his defeat. When a city official clambered on top of a bus and told the crowd through a bullhorn to break up the protest, there were whistles of derision and chants of `` Shame! Shame!'' from the crowd. One bearded pro-Yeltsin speaker near the building's doorway shouted, `` Shame on our Soviet democracy. Shame on our leaders.'' When the elderly man called for a one-day work stoppage across <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> is defeated, the crowd roared and raised its hands in approval. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in its monthly bulletin, published <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s October 1987 speech to the party body that got him sacked as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political scientist who specializes in Soviet studies, said the timing of the publication was aimed at discrediting <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> as he tries to win election. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 21, 1987 that faith in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms was waning and that the president was becoming the subject of `` intolerable'' glorification. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who had been named <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss in December 1985 and a non-voting member of the Politburo two months later, lost both posts as a result of his remarks. He was later named to a ministerial-rank job in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees building in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Government Urged To Tell All About Flight 103 Bomb Warnings</HEAD>

 Demands for an independent inquiry into <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s handling of warnings received before the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 will grow until the government explains its actions, an opposition party leader said Sunday `` We can not afford ` bag it and bin it' policies of British official secrecy on matters of security which affect every air traveler across the world,'' said <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON>, leader of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> `` must come clean on all the circumstances surrounding the advance warning,'' <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Unless he comes to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> at the earliest opportunity next week and is competely candid in every detail, the demand for an official inquiry on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> will become irresistible,'' he said. Those demanding an independent inquiry include the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and relatives of those killed when Flight 103 exploded over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, Dec. 21 on a flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Investigators say the disaster, in which 259 died aboard the plane and 11 on the ground, was caused by a bomb concealed in a radio-cassette player packed in luggage in the plane's hold. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said Sunday he told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> `` as much as it is in my power to tell.'' Government ministers `` should not go around revealing things that might be against the national interest,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said he welcomed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s decision to send top aides to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to assess aviation security <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he wants his officials to determine, among other things, when and how warnings were made against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights last year. `` The investigators have been working extremely closely with the Americans at all stages, and I think if they come over here, and the investigators have further talks with them, that can only be a very good thing,'' <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said. `` There is keen public concern in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in this country about the progress of this investigation and it's not surprising that people should wish to come over and have further talks.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed last week it prepared a warning dated Dec. 19 that included photographs of a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player but did not mail it until after Christmas. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> has said the letter was of little importance because similar information had been sent out a month earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and changed planes at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> before setting out for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Two <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspapers, The Observer and The Sunday Telegraph, reported Sunday that the Dec. 19 warning carried several important details that would have helped security people spot a rigged radio-cassette player.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Groups Express Unease, Rather Than Opposition to Appointment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Citing <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' lack of experience, civil rights groups are expressing concern that he might be the wrong choice to head the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division. Civil rights leaders have not taken a formal position on <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has designated as his choice to head the department's civil rights division. But these leaders say they are continuing to study <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' record to determine what position they will ultimately take if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nominates the black Republican from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> as assistant attorney general for civil rights. `` So far we are still quite concerned about the nomination because the position is extremely important for the civil rights community,'' said <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, 61, is `` a person who has n't really been involved in civil rights litigation for more than 20 years and a person who has taken some positions, for whatever reason, in civil rights that show no sensitivity for the problems,'' said Chambers Chambers notes <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' opposition to affirmative action, saying positions he has taken on school desegregation `` were quite bothersome.'' Besides <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' lack of experience, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he is concerned about <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' record as sheriff in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area. The record includes a court finding that he was legally responsible for injuries suffered by a prisoner who was beaten while in the custody of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriffs' deputies. The 1976 beating of <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> by an unidentified person who was admitted to his locked holding cell at a suburban <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> station was the subject of a strongly-worded 1985 ruling by the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The court cited <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' `` failure to provide a trained and disciplined county law enforcement agency'' or to investigate the beating incident. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> had testified that he did not know about the incident and therefore would not have been able to investigate it. But the appellate court said he was still legally liable because `` in his official capacity he had a duty to both know and act.'' `` The sheriff's subsequent failure to order and direct an investigation which disclosed exactly who were the perpetrators of these brutal violations of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution and to administer censure and punishment served to confirm the existence of an unstated ` policy' of toleration of illegal brutality toward any county prisoner who had threatened the life of a sheriff's deputy,'' the court said. `` I was sheriff an awful long time,'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said. `` There were many cases that required investigation. This is one case, that is one too many of course, but this was a very turbulent time.'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was sheriff from 1969 to 1982, when he was elected county executive. After switching to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> made an unsuccessful run for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> governor in 1986. He now wants to head a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> division that both civil and criminal civil rights laws, including statutes barring police from violating constitutional rights of criminal suspects. The division has brought many prosecutions for systematic police brutality against blacks. During his tenure as sheriff, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said, `` We had a reputation for taking strong actions against anyone who violated department rules and particularly civil rights.'' Asked if he had ever fired deputies for brutality, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said: `` I am certain that we did. Deputies were fired for all sorts of violations. `` I have never been accused of being insensitive of the rights of anyone,'' said <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a former policeman and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who worked as <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> civil rights investigator in the 1960s. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, the lawyer who represented <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> in the civil case, said she never challenged <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' statements that he did n't know about the <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> beating Although she does n't personally hold <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> responsible for the beating she said: `` Could the department have been run better? Probably. What it indicated to me was a complete lack of concern of any kind on the part of the department about this.''

 Moslem gunners volleyed rockets into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian heartland Sunday, and the Christians reportedly built up forces facing Syrian army positions, threatening to escalate fighting. Police said at least 20 rockets fired from Syrian-policed Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> exploded on beaches north of the capital near <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main power plant and <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> port, the Christians' main sea outlet There were no reports of damage or casualties on the 12th day of the latest fighting between Christians and Moslems in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war At least 49 people have been killed and 164 wounded since clashes erupted March 8. Sniper fire crackled all day across the ruins of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s old commercial district straddling the government-controlled port, and around the hilltop garrison town of <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION>, 15 miles southeast of the city, police said. Christians marked Palm Sunday in church rituals bereft of traditional festivities. Most Moslems stayed indoors. Both sides fear a repetition of Tuesday's bloodbath in which 39 people were killed and 96 wounded in a daylong shelling duel across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line. That was the peak of fighting between army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian units and Syrian-backed militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>. A shaky 48-hour truce, called midnight Thursday to allow mediators to negotiate, expired with no sign of a breakthrough. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military Cabinet of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, reiterated that he will deal only with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to negotiate a meaningful cease-fire, his spokesmen said. `` He does n't want to waste time talking to surrogates ... <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and his allies are merely doing <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s bidding,'' the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which supports the rival Moslem Cabinet of acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, has rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s overtures. In an all-out confrontation, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> could call on about 53,500 troops _ more than twice the number at <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command. `` If <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> really believes the Syrians might come around and recognize him, he must be daydreaming,'' a <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> aide said on condition of anonymity. `` There's no room for peace.'' He said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has been moving tanks and artillery to face Syrian army positions on the eastern and northeastern flanks of the Christian hinterland. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s spokesman refused to comment on that. But he charged the Syrians have set up 16 heavy artillery batteries in mountains overlooking the Christian enclave. Reliable witnesses said the Syrians also have set mortars and multibarrelled rocket launchers atop high-rise apartment buildings in outlying districts of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and its southern slums. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 800,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> minority appeared penned up with its back to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, ringed on three sides by pro-Syrian forces. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> on Sunday called for the formation of a military committee of Lebanese and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> army officers to draw up a timetable for a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> withdrawal. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, has not responded to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s demands. <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> maintains its troops here under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.

 District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> officials say outsiders are to blame for much of the city's homeless problem, but homeless rights advocates reject the notion that people move here from nearby suburbs to receive free shelter. The debate has been raging since before voters passed Initiative 17, the Right to Overnight Shelter Act, in November 1984, requiring the city to provide shelter to `` all persons in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>.'' Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had lobbied against the referendum, saying it would attract outsiders to the District to take advantage of free services. More than four years later, he says that has happened. `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is 22 percent of the region's population,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said during a news conference late last year. `` Yet we have 78 percent of the region's homeless. ... In every area of dependency, we have a disproportionate share _ not because people here are poor, but because <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> are not carrying their fair share.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said there were `` no hard stats'' to back up the mayor's assertion, but that when the mayor toured a newly opened shelter in January, half the people to whom he spoke said they were from out of town. `` It's a myth to think that homeless people are mobile and have the means to travel from around the country in order to get services,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Foscarinis </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless. `` Homeless people are generally destitute. They lack transportation money. It's hard enough to get from one side of the town to another, let alone from one part of the country to another.'' <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> officials estimate there are less than 10,000 homeless in the nation's capital, but homeless advocates say the number is closer to 15,000. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Spicer </PERSON>, homeless coordinator for neighboring <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, acknowledged that his county is short on shelter space. <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> provided shelter for more than 1,200 people during all of 1988, turning away 2,100, he said. But those who could n't find a place went elsewhere in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, not into <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Spicer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Felker </PERSON>, assistant director of the Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I believe that people are crossing the lines both ways. Ms. <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> said the county, which focuses on helping homeless people and families `` get back on their feet,'' sheltered more than 4,500 people last year, but turned away 5,100. Homeless rights advocates said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s assertion reflects the common practice of political leaders to blame the problem on outsiders. `` Every single mayor in the country is saying exactly the same thing,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Foscarinis </PERSON>. `` It's a typical response, no longer novel, by mayors who want to avoid their responsibility to aid the homeless.'' Initiative 17 is n't drawing homeless persons here, homeless advocates insist. `` People do n't bounce around for a bed and shelter,'' said <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, whose Community for Creative Non-Violence runs a 1,400-bed shelter near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol. `` People have as much a sense of place, whether they have a roof over their head or not, as people who live indoors. People only move for jobs.'' Other shelter operators reported similar experiences. `` The vast majority of our women are <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> residents,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocks </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ruth </ORGANIZATION>, which shelters homeless and battered women and children. `` The sense of people transitioning into <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> because the services are so good strikes me as absurd.'' <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollar </PERSON>, who directs the Luther Place Emergency Shelter for Women, said, `` From being on the inside, I'm not sure that <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>'s such an attractive place. Information about those who stay in city-run shelters is not available, although a computer system is being implemented to better track shelter residents, said <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> homeless coordinator <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. Council member <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> proposed a bill in February designed to ensure that residents get priority for long-term homeless services such as job training and drug counseling. She did not specify how homeless people could prove residency.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers killed four Palestinians and wounded at least 18 in the most intense clashes in months in the occupied territories, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army confirmed two dead and nine wounded in the clashes. The renewed violence took the Palestinian death toll to at least 403 since the Arab uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began in December 1987. Protests erupted in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> after three Arabs were killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> gunfire and at least 20 others were wounded on Saturday. Early Sunday, a 26-year-old Palestinian was shot to death after stabbing three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border police in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the army said. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the border guards were wounded as they broke into a house in pursuit of the masked Palestinian who fled after hurling rocks at troops. Two of the soldiers were reported in moderate condition and the third was lightly wounded. The dead man was identified by hospital officials as <PERSON> Talal </PERSON> <PERSON> Selim </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Araj </PERSON>, from the city's <LOCATION> Daraj </LOCATION> neighborhood. The officials said he was shot in the head and chest. In the afternoon, a 15-year-old Arab boy was fatally shot in the city after hurling a bottle at soldiers. The army said the soldier who opened fire thought the bottle was a firebomb. Soldiers have orders allowing them to shoot if attacked with firebombs. The name of the boy was not released. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said two other Palestinians, including a 12-year-old, were shot to death as troops opened fire on stone-throwing youths in <LOCATION> Silet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harthieh </LOCATION>, a village near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>. An army spokesman said soldiers opened fire in the <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, but added military investigators were still trying to confirm the deaths and checking reports of other casualties throughout the occupied territories. The victims in <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> were identified by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters as <PERSON> Samer </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Arouri </PERSON>, 12, and <PERSON> Neman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaradat </PERSON>, 18, who both were reported shot in the head. Most of the injuries were reported in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where Palestinians staged a general strike to protest three shooting deaths the day before. Palestinian teen-agers blocked entrances to <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with trucks, rocks and burning tires. In an effort to quell the violence, the army confined more than 165,000 people to their homes in five refugee camps and several neighborhoods of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, an Arab reporter said. Bursts of automatic weapons fire could be heard throughout <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as soldiers tried to put down rioting, he said. In one neighborhood of the city, about 100 youths marched through the streets waving the <LOCATION> Koran </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, and shouting `` God is great ... Down with the occupiers.'' Arab journalists compared the intensity of rioting in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> to the early days of the uprising, and an army official said uprising leaders were testing border police newly assigned to the occupied territories. `` It's primarily a test of the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> who have a reputation for keeping order,'' deputy army spokesman, Col. <PERSON> Raanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said. `` They are trying to keep the border Police from getting more control of the streets than the army reserve units had.'' The army has tried to reduce bloodshed in the occupied territories by replacing untrained reserve troops with <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> units, who are experienced in riot control and are permanently assigned to the disputed areas. Among those wounded in Sunday's clashes were 12 Palestinians shot in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, including a 13-year-old boy in serious condition with a head wound, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, six Palestinians were reportedly wounded when soldiers opened fire on stone-throwing protesters.

 The Discovery space shuttle astronauts, back from a five-day mission in which they deployed a vital communications satellite, spent Sunday with their families but were to return to work the next day to discuss their nearly flawless flight. The crew's 1.9 million-mile journey ended Saturday morning with a picture perfect landing at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that was watched by a near-record 460,000 spectators. Discovery's flight lasted 4 days, 23 hours and 39 minutes. It was the 28th shuttle mission overall and the third since Challenger exploded, claiming the lives of seven astronauts and halting manned spaceflights for nearly three years. The next flight is the planned April 28 launch of Atlantis, which will deploy a planetary probe that will map the surface of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> hopes to complete seven flights this year and 12 a year by 1992. Space agency officials Saturday praised the five Discovery astronauts and the orbiter as well as the efforts of employees who have worked to get the shuttle program back on track. `` I think the country realizes we're back,'' Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for space flight, said at a post-flight news conference Saturday at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>. Truly also said the shuttle `` is just as clean as it can be.'' Although <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> television close-ups showed numerous white marks on the black thermal tiles that protect the shuttle's underside during the fiery re-entry through the atmosphere, Truly described them as `` a few minor chips.'' A little more than seven hours after touchdown, the astronauts and their wives arrived home in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> where they were greeted by their children and about 500 friends, fellow workers and space fans. Discovery commander <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, who guided the 97-ton spaceship to its centerline landing, said his crew worked hard both before and after blastoff Monday. `` I'd like to thank all of you and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for the opportunity to fly in space,'' Coats added. The other Discovery astronauts are pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON>, <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON> were all space rookies. `` It was an awful lot of fun being out in space,'' <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> said, adding that it had been `` a long wait'' for all the crew members. After having the day off Sunday, the astronauts are scheduled to return Monday to the Johnson Space Center to brief other <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> employees on details of the mission. Discovery remained at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION> on Sunday for further scrutiny before being returned to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Just six hours after liftoff from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> on Monday, the astronauts deployed a $ 100 million Tracking and Data Relay Satellite The deployment, the crew's primary mission, completes a constellation of three such spacecraft that will enable <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to have nearly constant contact with space shuttles and other satellites. The new satellite will be operational in a few weeks. At that point, the space agency will begin closing six ground stations at a savings of $ 13 million a year.

 A case echoing themes from last year's presidential campaign and the political turmoil engendered by the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war will be argued Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> when it studies a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law barring desecration of the flag The justices are being urged by prosecutors to reinstate a one-year jail sentence and $ 2,000 fine against a man accused of burning an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag at a demonstration in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> during the 1984 Republican National Convention. The high court is being asked to limit what forms of political protest are protected by the Constitution's guarantee of free expression. A decision is expected by July. Civil libertarians and artists say laws like the one in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> would permit police and prosecutors to suppress a broad range of dissent. Law enforcement officials, with support from conservative groups, say their target is flagrant, offensive conduct that may threaten national unity. At the center of the controversy is <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Joey </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>. `` I believe we live in a sick and dying empire that is desperately clutching at its symbols and attempting to enforce patriotic allegiance and obedience from the people and suppress anti-patriotic opposition,'' he said recently. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1984 following a protest that ended in front of city hall with demonstrators pouring lighter fluid on and igniting an American flag authorities said was taken from a pole outside a bank building. There was trial testimony that the protesters chanted, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the red, white and blue, we spit on you.'' Police said the demonstrators also overturned potted plants and spray-painted buildings during a destructive march through the city. But the only criminal charge was against <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> for violating a state law that forbids `` the desecration of a venerated object'' if that is likely to cause `` serious offense.'' Police officers who arrested <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said they were seriously offended by the flag burning. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he did not actually douse or ignite the flag, although he approved the action and gave speeches during the rally. He said he was singled out for prosecution because the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police knew he was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s jury conviction was overturned by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> which said `` the act for which -LRB- he -RRB- was convicted was clearly ` speech' contemplated by the First Amendment.'' The appeals court did not overturn the law itself, leaving open the possibility that flag burning in some situations would not represent symbolic speech and could be prosecuted. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement last fall that it would hear an appeal by the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney to reinstate <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s conviction seemed particularly timely <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning for the presidency then, was stressing patriotic values and attacking Democratic opponent Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for vetoing legislation to require that public school teachers lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance. The <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> case also calls to mind the days of draft card burning and intense opposition to the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, led in part by radical left-wing groups. But the argument over patriotism and dissent has a longer history, and laws against flag burning predate this century. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1943 ruled that the government may not compel citizens to salute the flag. The justices in 1974 threw out the conviction of a college student who taped a peace symbol onto a flag. But they never have decided whether laws against destruction of the flag are constitutional. While many states and the federal government have such statutes, their enforcement apparently is spotty. Rallying to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s support _ while not necessarily agreeing with his political views _ have been numerous famous artists. They have submitted a `` friend-of-the-court'' legal brief in the case that said laws like the one in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> permit prosecutors at their own whim to decide what is permissible dissent. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> statute could even be applied to `` the work of a movie actor burning a flag in a movie about the student anti-war protests of the 1960s,'' they said. The brief includes 22 examples, some famous, of depictions of the flag that may offend some people. Groups that support the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law say their goal is to prohibit destructive conduct that threatens the flag as a symbol of national unity. `` It can not be disputed that the flag is a symbol of national unity whose physical integrity can be protected by the state,'' said a coalition headed by the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> here and including Veterans of Foreign Wars. `` To most people, an assault on the flag constitutes an assault on them as well.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> noted that an inscription outside the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> State Capitol in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> refers to the Civil War as an attempt by the South, `` animated by the spirit of 1776,'' to preserve its rights. `` Not everyone in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> takes quite that romantic a view of the Civil War,'' the civil liberties union said. `` But the First Amendment protects the rights of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to express this idea of national disunity.''

<HEAD>Killing of Congressman Underscores Cult of Political Violence</HEAD>

 The assassination of a congressman shows the cult of political violence still haunts the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, despite President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s vow to end `` rule by the bullet.'' Rep. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON>, 55, a member of a pro-Aquino party, was shot to death Friday with two other people after arriving in the airport in his home province, <LOCATION> Masbate </LOCATION>, after a flight from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> 240 miles away. No arrests have been reported. But <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers quoted relatives as speculating that <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON>, from an influential political family, was slain by business or political rivals. He was the first congressman slain since Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> came to power in 1986 after a civilian-military uprising toppled President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. He was vice chairman of the public order and security committee in the House of Representatives. `` This is something we in public life have to expect in our job, especially in the kind of politics we still have,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> after the <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> killing. <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> was critically injured 16 years ago during a bombing at a political rally in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. During a speech in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in November 1986, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> boasted that her `` people power'' administration had replaced `` rule by the bullet with rule by the ballot.'' However, <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> is the latest in a lengthening list of politicians, journalists, human rights lawyers, municipal officials, and labor leaders slain in unsolved political killings during the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> administration. The victims include Local Governments Secretary <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON>, who was gunned down near his home in August 1987. <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON> became the first Philippine Cabinet member slain while in office. Others are labor leader <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Olalia </PERSON>, kidnapped and murdered in November 1986; leftist leader <PERSON> Lean </PERSON> <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON>, slain in September 1987; and <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerochi </PERSON>, a senior official of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION>, who was ambushed near his home last month. More than 90 people, including about 40 candidates, were killed in political violence during the campaign for January 1988 regional elections. About 50 people died in campaign violence before May 1987 congressional balloting. The military says such violence was worse during the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> years, and it often blames killings on Communist rebels. Indeed, the rebels have claimed responsibility for killing hundreds of police, soldiers and low-level officials in the last three years. But many Filipinos believe most killings of politicians have been the work of political rivals. `` If there is an outstanding truism about Filipino political life, it is this: Politically motivated murder is not meant to be punished,'' said the independent <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. `` In fact, what exists are the trappings of government without its essence. We have laws that are all too frequently _ and with total impunity _ violated.'' Killings of political figures, which grab headlines, also seem to go hand-in-hand with a general lawlessness that the government has been unable to contain. Last year, about 3,700 killings were reported in greater <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, which has a population of about 8 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> reported in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week that of 26 journalists killed last year in the line of duty, five were in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Most of the Filipino journalists slain last year had reported on illegal gambling and other corruption in the provinces. By comparison, war-ravaged <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> registered four killings of journalists in 1988.

 <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Duet </PERSON> is one of a dying breed _ the Spanish moss entrepreneur. He makes a living by cleaning and baling the archetypal Southern moss for sale, but there just is n't as much call for it as there once was `` This used to be a big business,'' Duet said, `` but there are so many substitutes for moss today that the demand is no longer as great as it once was.'' Spanish moss _ the long, stringy stuff that hangs from trees in the South _ used to be a common stuffing for mattresses, sofas and other furniture. Now it's used mainly in flower beds, fish hatcheries, for making floor mats and in some kinds of furniture, <PERSON> Duet </PERSON> said. `` I do not believe there will ever be a shortage of moss, but I am not so sure about buyers,'' <PERSON> Duet </PERSON> said. `` It's hard to say what substitute will come out next.'' It's a low-tech business in an increasingly high-tech world. The harvesters he buys from use almost as little fancy gadgetry as they used during the Great Depression, when their survival often hinged on their ability to gather and market moss. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hebert </PERSON>, who began gathering it half a century ago with his father, remembers that the moss used to hang so low in the trees that a man could stand up in a skiff and pluck it from the branches. `` Today you have to reach for it,'' <PERSON> Hebert </PERSON> said.

 Terrorism warnings issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> before the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> were largely ineffective and sometimes `` dangerously inaccurate,'' the head of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee said Sunday. Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on government activities and transportation, voiced the criticism in releasing an analysis of 33 <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> security bulletins issued between Jan. 1, 1988 and Feb. 16 of this year The panel found that at least six of the security bulletins contained information that may be linked to the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane, which killed 270 people. Investigators have concluded that the jet was blown up by plastic explosive hidden inside a radio-casette player. `` Regrettably, these and other <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> bulletins were sometimes untimely, sometimes dangerously inaccurate and almost completely devoid of effective and specific instructions for countering possible threats,'' Rep. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` Some bulletins recommended actions that were pointless or even absurd.'' She added: `` Taken as a group, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> bulletins failed to provide meaningful guidance to airlines faced with the risk of terrorist attack.'' The subcommittee focused particular attention on a warning written on Nov. 17, following the arrest in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> three weeks earlier of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. The bulletin described a bomb found in the raids _ plastic explosive secreted inside a radio-cassette player, with a barometric-pressure detonator designed to explode the device at a preset altitude. According to the subcommittee, that bulletin mistakenly advised that the <ORGANIZATION> PFLP-GC </ORGANIZATION> `` has not been known to undertake terrorist attacks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' A recent <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study said the Palestinian group had machine-gunned an airliner in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, hijacked two other airliners bound for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities and warned in 1986 that `` there will be no safety for any traveler'' on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliner. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> bulletin said its information about the bomb was based on `` preliminary analyses by West German authorities.'' `` It is difficult to understand why explosive experts needed more than three weeks to complete an urgently needed analysis of this device,'' the subcommittee said. `` Either the West Germans lacked the required technical skills -LRB- which is unlikely -RRB- or West German-FAA communications had serious flaws.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s response to this and two other security bulletins prompted by the West German arrests was limited to examining and X-raying selected passengers' carry-on baggage containing electronic devices. But the subcommittee noted that `` the bomb that destroyed Flight 103 reportedly was carried as checked baggage and, if it resembled the PFLP-GC version, was specifically designed to thwart normal X-ray inspection.'' Another <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> security bulletin, dated Dec. 7, reported that an unidentified caller phoning the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, had said there would be a bombing attempt against a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> airliner flying from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Flight 103 had originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, going from there to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where it changed planes before heading to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The subcommittee report noted that `` at least three <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> security bulletins ... contained disquieting information involving <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' `` Yet despite the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> warning of a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> bombing, the discovery of a radio-casette player bomb, and two attempts to test <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport security, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> failed to order <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to take any security measures beyond those already in place,'' it said.

 Newspapers frequently detail the plight of the nation's homeless. <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> does n't read the papers _ he sleeps in them on Third Street. White, hardened by years of begging, either is mute or chooses not to speak. He communicates with fierce brown eyes and with the cane that props him up on his only leg. One tap means `` no;'' two taps mean `` yes.'' When White is asked whether he will benefit from a city ordinance ordering the opening of a vacant building to the homeless, he stares down at his stub and taps once. White is one of the thousands of homeless who wander the streets of the nation's sixth-largest city as officials try to find them shelter. Their challenge: providing it without jeopardizing <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s economic rebirth. The relationship between advocates for the homeless and Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> A. Young frequently has been stormy. Both sides disagree on the numbers of the city's shelterless. Advocates insist there are 10,000 to 60,000 others like <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a statistic disputed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s press secretary. `` That's absurd,'' he said. `` If you go out and check the shelters, you'll see that most of them are half empty. There's not a single case this winter of somebody not having a place to spend the night.'' The ordinance that went into effect March 10, requiring <PERSON> Young </PERSON> to designate a vacant public building or rent a private one as a `` warming center,'' is a scaled-down version of a measure that would have opened 39 downtown buildings to the homeless. Young vetoed the more expansive plan, saying it would cost $ 2 million and threaten <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s convention business. The City Council, which proposed the ordinance, fell short in an attempt to override the veto. The warming center opened last week in a recreation building on the city's east side. No homeless showed up because word had n't yet spread on the streets, the shelter's operators said. Meanwhile, community leaders speculated about the impact of <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s veto on his widely expected run this fall for a fifth four-year term. <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit-Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> of the Homeless, said her group is urging the homeless it aids to register to vote. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> knows the anguish of homelessness. A year ago, her landlord evicted her and her five children after the family could n't afford to pay its gas bill. `` I went from shelter to shelter,'' she said. `` My family called me the Shelter Queen. When the mayor says -LRB- the original ordinance -RRB- would have cost $ 2 million, he's admitting there's a terrible, desperate need.'' Last week _ while the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> debated the merits of its housing plan _ <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON>, who heads the state's welfare agency, urged officials to set aside part of the $ 500 million spent annually on temporary housing in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and invest it in a more permanent solution. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, a coalition aimed at improving the quality of life in the city, agrees. `` Putting the homeless in public buildings does n't solve the problem,'' he said. `` Ten years ago, homeless were derelicts with <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> jackets and wine bottles hanging out of their pockets. Now, they're women and children. `` You need permanent public housing. Otherwise, as soon as it's warm, they're back on the streets again. Young's veto of the original homeless plan probably wo n't backfire on him politically because it was replaced by the modified measure, <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> said `` The mayor sees the need and he's done something about it,'' he said.

 Israeli troops and allied Lebanese militiamen traded artillery fire with pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem guerrillas in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Sunday, and police said six people were wounded. They said the brief exchange flared after a 75-strong armored Israeli force and fighters of the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> entered the village of <LOCATION> Dallafeh </LOCATION> village, just outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone, in search of pro-Iranian guerrillas `` They destroyed two houses in the village, but they did n't find any guerrillas,'' said a police spokesman, who by custom is not named. `` As they were pulling out after a four-hour search they came under fire from guerrillas of the Islamic Resistance.''

<HEAD>Explorer Plans to Plumb Boston Harbor for 18th-Century Shipwreck</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blasczak </PERSON> was 12 years old, he read about an 18th-century French ship that sank in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Twenty years later, he has received permission to search for the wreck and its reputed riches. After researching the journals of French soldiers and other documents, <PERSON> Blasczak </PERSON>, 32, a construction worker from <LOCATION> Hopkinton </LOCATION>, believes the ship contains between $ 50 million and $ 500 million in gold coins and other cargo. `` It's like reliving a childhood dream,'' said <PERSON> Blasczak </PERSON>, who read about the Magnifique in an <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> Snow book, ` Shipwrecks Around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.' `` Back then, it might not have been that easy to do but with the technology we have now, it's possible.'' Last fall, the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaelogical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> approved <PERSON> Blasczak </PERSON>'s request to search for the Magnifique, a French vessel that ran aground near the end of the Revolutionary War. <PERSON> Blasczak </PERSON> plans to begin initial work on the site within a few days. The 218-foot ship may have been carrying up to 500 soldiers when it sank in August 1782, said <PERSON> Blasczak </PERSON>. The wooden vessel was weakened by a tour of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> where a parasite called the teredo had eaten away at its hull. <PERSON> Blasczak </PERSON> said his research could not uncover whether men died when the ship sank in less than an hour or if they were ferried to safety. `` The French were very secretive about their navy back then,'' he said. <PERSON> Blasczak </PERSON> said records culled form the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and the Journals of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> soldiers allude to a cargo that may have included 300,000 pistoles _ French gold coins that were also called <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> d'Ors. Last year, <PERSON> Blasczak </PERSON> and his team dove with a magnetometer, which detects magnetic metals, and a sonar system, which uses sound waves to detect objects, and found a large mass they believe to be the wreck. They believe the ship is under 20 feet of water and buried under 5 feet of sand and mud. <PERSON> Blasczak </PERSON> said the currents have changed over the years and the mud is now washing off the Magnifique, exposing it. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastone </PERSON>, associate director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaelogical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Blasczak </PERSON>'s plan is the second one involving a search in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, the nation's filthiest harbor <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, who found the wreck of the Whydah off the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> coast several years ago with artifacts estimated at $ 40 million, has received initial permission to search for the crates of tea thrown into the harbor during the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> before the Revolutionary War. `` It's like people are just finding out there's a lot out there,'' said <PERSON> Mastone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Blasczak </PERSON> is working with a crew of seven, including three divers. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cembrola </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION>, is in charge of cataloging any items retrieved from the wreck. `` I called my best friend from 20 years ago and told him about it,'' said <PERSON> Blasczak </PERSON>. `` He could n't believe I was actually doing what we talked about so long ago.''

<HEAD>Family Of Woman Files $1 Million Lawsuit Claiming Botched Funeral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A family has sued a cemetery for $ 1 million, claiming that a damaged casket allowed mourners to see the deceased's foot and a cemetery employee interrupted the funeral to demand that the rabbi move his car. All of this happened at the funeral of <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> last year, family members said in a lawsuit filed in <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last week. Her husband, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, and her two daughters and their families are seeking the damages from Menorah Gardens and Funeral Chapels for putting them through an emotional wringer at the funeral in January 1988. Menorah Gardens funeral director <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissman </PERSON> said through a spokesperson that he knew nothing about the lawsuit. `` It was a terible, terrible thing,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` We are looking forward to our day in court. Mrs. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> and other relatives declined to discuss details of the case on the advice of their attorney. The lawsuit said the grave site was `` prepared in a sloppy and unkempt manner'' and chairs were filthy and rusty, and the scaffolding was uneven and covered with artificial carpet.'' This caused mourners to `` trip and stumble,'' the lawsuit said. Pallbearers were supposed to carry the casket from a hearse to the grave site. Instead, `` slovenly attired and unclean'' cemetery workers did so until family members insisted on completing the task themselves. During the service, a cemetery worker demanded that the rabbi move his car from a designated parking area, the lawsuit said. When the rabbi continued with the service, the employee wrapped a chain around the bumper of the rabbi's car and `` a backhoe or other piece of heavy equipment backed within close range of the automobile.'' As the casket was being lowered, it slipped as it was being placed in a vault. Two lids popped open, exposing the deceased woman's foot with a white tag attached to it, the lawsuit said. The casket would not fit in the vault and the straps supporting the casket could not be removed without more jarring of the casket and prying it with iron bars, it said. In June, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> ordered a tombstone and specified that, for religious reasons, it should not be placed atop his wife's grave until Nov. 18. He and one of his daughters asked to see Mrs. <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>'s grave but were told that the original marker had been chewed up by a lawn mower, according to the lawsuit. In September, <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> visited his wife's grave and found that her headstone was on it, contrary to his wishes.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON>'s governing Socialists emerged the big winners Sunday in the second round of municipal elections, winning control of several large cities from the conservative and center-right parties. Early results showed such conservative bastions as <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mulhouse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dunkirk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Blois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Avignon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Quimper </LOCATION> falling into Socialist hands. Frequently city elections have been used to criticize the national government, but this year results seemed to confirm the leftist trend that re-elected <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> last spring and gave him a leftist majority in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is the first time that we have seen a government receive a powerful, popular encouragement during the municipal elections,'' said Interior Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Joxe </PERSON>, a Socialist. The second round was required in 832 towns and cities larger than 3,500 where no candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote in last Sunday's first round. Turnout in the ninth election in less than a year was estimated at between 72 and 73.5 percent. A national projection by the TF1 television network showed the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies winning 78 cities with populations above 30,000, compared to 66 in 1983 municipal elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won mayoral seats in 48 cities, compared to 53 six years ago; the conservative Rally for the Republic won 45 big cities compared to 47 in 1983; and the center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> won 39 cities as opposed to 41 six years ago. The right was losing few municipalities of more than 30,000, but they were behind in important cities and taking only smaller, less important ones from the left. There was some good news on the right, however. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noir </PERSON>, a conservative deputy in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, defeated a center-right incumbent in <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s third-largest city. Former President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing, now head of the center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, said the municipal elections were less ideological than in the past. `` The Socialists registered a certain progress,'' he said. `` In all, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is still divided in two'' between right and left.

 Police using tear gas and rubber bullets clashed with about 100 youths who threw bottles and rocks in a protest against <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>'s chronic shortage of inexpensive housing. One police car was set ablaze by a gasoline bomb and some store windows were broken in the riot Saturday night in downtown <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, but no one was injured or arrested, police said Sunday. The protest began peacefully but turned violent when police briefly detained a youth who was caught painting slogans on a wall. Police said the riot, the city's worst in recent years, caused more than $ 125,000 in damage. It was the third time in a month that demonstrations against the shortage of low-rent apartments in the city have become violent.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other members of the ruling Politburo failed to win unanimous support as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> deputies in a new Soviet legislature, Pravda reported Sunday. Providing unusual insight into divisions in the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said of 641 <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members and alternates who voted Thursday, 12 were opposed to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, reputedly a conservative force on the Politburo, got the most `` no'' votes of any Politburo member, 78, according to Pravda. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and some other public organizations are entitled to directly choose 750 of the 2,250 members of the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. The other 1,500, representing territorial districts, will be chosen March 26 in nationwide elections. Some Soviets have objected to the provision of the reforms championed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. They give the party direct representation in the new assembly, which will chose legislators and elect the Soviet president. The vote by <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members and alternates showed there is considerable opposition not only to <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, but also to Politburo members closely linked to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Customarily such votes are unanimous, but the secret balloting used to chose deputies may have encouraged some to frankly express opposition to senior Kremlin figures. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, said to be <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s closest adviser, got 59 `` no'' votes, while the candidacy of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON> was rejected by 25 of those voting. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> installed <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON> as party boss following the November 1987 sacking of <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. Twenty-two people also voted against <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ally named to the Politburo in September 1988 to assume the ideology portfolio stripped from <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>. Politburo member <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikonov </PERSON>, who serves as deputy to <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> in the latter's role as chief of the party's commission on agriculture, received 26 `` no'' votes. Along with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Politburo members who received the widest support were <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON>, chief of the party's commission on social and economic policy, with 19 votes opposed, and former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>, with 13 opposed Prime Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, whose popularity soared among Soviets when he was named to head a special Politburo commission directing relief efforts for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s earthquake, received a broader mandate than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with only 10 votes opposed to his candidacy. Of the remaining members of the 12-man Politburo, Ukrainian party boss <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> and Russian federation president <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON> are running unopposed in electoral districts. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s ministerial post bars him from being a candidate. Although <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members proposed 31,000 candidates to represent the party in the new legislature, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chose to nominate all 100 people suggested by the Politburo for the 100 seats, and then elected all those they had nominated.

<TEXT>
 Bright-eyed innocent-looking babies peer out of nearly 5,500 photos seized in a fraud investigation. But these kids are no criminals; their mugs come from two bankrupt photo companies that collected money for the pictures and did n't deliver. Staff members of the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney's office are trying to track down parents to deliver the goods. The photos come from the Sheridan-Peter <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> and American Color Portraits, both of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and the companies' photo subcontractors. Three years ago, the photo companies declared bankruptcy _ after collecting money for the photographs, but before delivering them to waiting parents. Most customers were from the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, but some came from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, officials said. `` It was more than a normal business failure,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiffman </PERSON>, supervisor of the prosecutor's consumer fraud unit. `` They knew they were going out of business. They still signed people and took their money and their memories.'' The consumer fraud unit took possession of the photographs last year after suing the companies, accusing them of fraud. `` Now, the only problem is that many parents have moved,'' said <PERSON> Neomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, a state's attorney paralegal. `` We have no way of tracking them.'' It took Ms. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> 100 telephone calls to locate three parents who were still at their present addresses. One successful call linked <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Manring </PERSON>, 4, of <PERSON> Elgin </PERSON>, with his photo when he was 2. `` I knew something was wrong when six months passed without our getting the photos,'' said his mother, <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Manring </PERSON>. `` Then the studio's phone was disconnected.'' <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Saffold </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> had another story. She had planned as a gift for her aging mother a family portrait of Ms. <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>'s 12 brothers and sisters and her mother's 50 grandchildren and great-grandchildren. It took months to get everyone together. `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON> shot the picture in my house,'' said Ms. <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>. `` We had to reshoot it again. It was still all wrong.'' Finally, she said, she had 13 separate family portraits taken for $ 1,500. But she never got the pictures. Last Thursday, she received one sister's portrait. The rest are still missing.

<HEAD>New Army Helicopter Unfit For Battle: Memo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new high-tech Army attack helicopter has broken down so many times that one commander complained the craft is less fit for battle than a 1960s vintage chopper, according to a report published Sunday. In a recent exercise, all 12 of the AH-64 Apache helicopters involved were incapacitated at least once within five days, according to internal <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> memos obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The problems have prompted Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, whose staff obtained the memo, to call for an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is unbelievable that we are fielding overly sophisticated and outrageously expensive weapons systems for our fighting men which simply do n't work,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said in a letter demanding the probe. The Army has received 450 of the AH-64s, manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, for $ 13.4 million each, and plans to buy total of 975, spending $ 13.6 billion for the deal. Army and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> officials dispute allegations the helicopter is a hopeless case and defend its reliability. But in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> memo, Col. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, commander of the 82nd Aviation Brigade at Ft.. <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, was highly critical of the AH-64, saying that for now at least he'd prefer to fly the AH-1, an updated version of Bell Helicopter's 1960s-vintage Cobra, which flew in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> `` I have been a fan of the AH-64 for over a year, but the aircraft has let me down,'' <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> wrote to Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, whose office was responsible for buying the AH-64. `` If we went to war tomorrow, I'd have to recommend taking all of our AH-1s before we outload one AH-64,'' <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> wrote. `` We need helicopters to work for at least the first 72 hours. The Apache has long way to go to make it to the battlefield. Please help.'' The AH-64, designed to attack Soviet tanks and other armored vehicles, experienced dozens of problems in an exercise, including numerous instances of jamming on its 30-millimeter machine guns, according to the memo. Army records show that the entire fleet of AH-64s has been grounded at least three times since the craft entered service in early 1984. Five Apaches have been lost and flight and two more have burned on the ground. But <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials said that the observation's in <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>'s memo are not representative of other <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units. `` The Apache is a fine airplane,'' said Col. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrick </PERSON>, the AH-64 program manager in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` We are finding that it has more capability than the designers foresaw.'' <PERSON> Herrick </PERSON> acknowledged that the craft has experienced problems with its rotor blades, bearings and compressors, but said solutions have been found to all the problems. <ORGANIZATION> Mcdonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> officials also played down the problems. `` There are problems with any new weapon and you do n't find out about some of the problems until you field the system,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. `` We have heard both good and bad, but we have hear a lot of good.''

 High winds and heavy seas forced workers to suspend their search Sunday for containers of insecticide and other chemicals lost in the English Channel from an <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> ship, authorities said. Officials at the Marine Prefecture in this port city said winds of up to 30 knots made the search impossible. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, scientist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said a huge area of the channel would be polluted and fish wiped out if one of the containers holding six tons of Lindane insecticide leaked into the water. `` It would be an environmental disaster,'' said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, a research fellow of the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> environmental organization at <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> should look beyond park borders and adopt a regional approach to maintaining the nation's environmental legacy, according to a study commissioned by a non-profit conservation group. The study, done for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also urged that funds for the park service be increased as much as 10 percent and that park managers cooperate with state and local groups to preserve the 80 million acres in national parks. `` We have to give up the notion that park management stops at park boundaries,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, who headed the panel of experts who made the recommendations. `` If you have a grizzly bear range that stretches across two national parks, six national forests, a state forest and 43 ranches, you must coordinate your efforts,'' he said. `` We ca n't solve all problems simply by buying land.'' The group presented the study Sunday to <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Park service spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON> said it `` will be given close scrutiny. `` We generally agree with the commission's conclusions, but it is a time of very tight budgets. Thus the commission's recommendations will be weighed against those realities,'' he said. <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON> emphasized that the report was prepared by an independent panel of experts. `` We are not bound by their findings, but we certainly will be guided by them,'' he said. The 17-member panel examined policies at 49 national parks, in addition to national monuments, historic sites, battlefields, seashores, recreation areas, the Statue of Liberty and the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> wilderness area. `` The national parks are a uniquely American gift to the nation and the world,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, an authority on forest biology and forest management. `` We now need a renewed commitment to the parks and a quantum leap forward in the level of research and management to safeguard this irreplaceable heritage,'' he said. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said it is essential for the park service to educate the public about conservation. In addition, he said, the parks should be used to educate the public about toxic waste, deforestation, the greenhouse effect and the extinction of plant and animal species. He cited the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of last year's fires at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> as an example of mismanagement within the agency The fires affected nearly half of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.2 million acres The park service has had a policy of allowing fires to burn naturally so long as they do n't threaten areas of human habitation. But <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said the agency should adopt `` ecosystem management,'' in which each area is considered individually. For instance, he said, some park ecosystems should be allowed to burn naturally, but others should not; natural predators should be permitted to control animal populations in some places but not in others. `` But what this nation should avoid is having all its eggs in one basket by treating all ecosystems _ inside and outside the parks _ alike,'' he said. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>'s panel pointed to the 1988 agreement involving the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smoky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> as a model for others to follow. The Great Smoky agreement calls for national, state and local agencies to share data and cooperate in the management of natural and cultural resources throughout the southern Appalachian region. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>'s group also examined the so-called <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Report </PERSON>, named after a 1963 committee chaired by <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starker </PERSON> <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON>. That report put forth the idea of letting nature take its own course, unimpeded by humans. But <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said that as national parks face increasing pressures, it is important for the experts to intervene sometimes. `` One of the big problems that still exists in the park service is that there is a desire to believe that by letting things alone you keep them from changing. Why people think that happens with natural systems when they know it does n't happen with thir own home, I do n't know,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> suffered a terrible year of natural disasters in 1988 stemming in part from environmental destruction, especially deforestation, according to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report made available Sunday. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> chronicled massive flooding in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and drought in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It linked the natural disasters with general environmental ravages, especially large-scale deforestation. `` The phenomena of floods, mudslides, even earthquakes can be directly related to deforestation,'' the report said. The commission, which described 1988 as `` a terrible year,'' said major environmental problems faced by <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries included soil erosion, loss of deserts and industrial pollution. The report was included in an annual survey of the region. It will be presented at the organization's yearly conference, which begins in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on March 27. More than 1,000 delegates are expected to attend the 10-day meeting. The group has urged that development strategies take into account environmental factors.

 President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> on Sunday told hundreds of Jewish leaders from 30 countries that he prayed their conference of solidarity with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would help advance peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` You have answered the call to show solidarity with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> at a time of stress and hope in which people of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> face many fateful decisions,'' <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> told participants in a forum organized by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. `` Let's pray that this conference will represent a genuine advance towards peace and political adjustment in this area,'' <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> said in a speech at the president's residence in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Some people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have criticized the conference as a gimmick to boost <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s hard-line policies before he makes a crucial trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next month. But some of the 1,100 people who arrived for the three-day forum said they came to strenghten <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as it faces the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands and international pressure to devise a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative. The Prime Minister's Conference of Jewish Solidarity begins Monday. `` I do n't think it's our responsibility or our business to tell the Israeli government and people how and what to do. We have been asked to come here not to ... give direction to policy but to put a line to all those out there who say we no longer support <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON>, national director of the New York-based Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. `` To show that we do stand behind the people, and the state, and the government, but not specific policies, I think today is more important than ever before,'' <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON> said in an interview. When <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, the 73-year-old leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in April, his hard-line views are expected to come under increasing pressure from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has repeatedly criticized <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, insisting it is a terrorist organization. He also opposes the American `` land for peace'' formula. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Friday said peace plans he would take to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> do not include a territorial compromise on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, territories occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since 1967. Three left-wing opposition parties, which support talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and giving away at least some occupied land, were quick to attack the conference, saying it would not represent the whole range of Israeli opinion. `` The real multifaceted, piercing, dramatic dialogue taking place within <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not be reflected there,'' <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is legitimate that the government seeks ... support, but then you can not present the conference as supporting the Israeli people or the state as such.''

 A lawyer in the upcoming trial of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> charged in the death of the group leader's daughter says he will attempt to prove that beating did not cause the child's death. `` A pathologist will testify that, in his opinion, some other things happened that night that may have caused the death of <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> said Sunday. `` It was not a result of any violent act.'' After five weeks of grilling potential jurors, attorneys are close to raising the curtain on the trial of four group members charged with manslaughter in the death of the 8-year-old. The group's stated aim was to rescue ghetto youngsters through discipline, but critics say the children were often mistreated, sometimes even beaten hundreds of times. Meanwhile, 51 children taken from the group after the girl died five months ago remain in foster homes. Two others are living with relatives. The children were taken from a farmhouse the group was renting near <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>, in the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. There has been no public word from <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the group's founder and self-proclaimed savior of ghetto youth from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, since he ended a 40-day personal retreat March 12. Since Feb. 13, four court-appointed lawyers have been questioning potential jurors four days a week in a mostly deserted courtroom at the <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>. The defendants _ <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ sit quietly in the second row of the gallery, occasionally passing notes to their lawyers. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> said the lawyers were likely to settle on 12 jurors and two to four alternates in the coming week, and opening arguments could begin March 27. More than 80 jurors have been examined over the last five weeks, with nearly three of four excused because they had read about the case or seen television reports on it. In the weeks after <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorea </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>'s death, local airwaves were flooded with state allegations that <LOCATION> Ecclesia </LOCATION> children were routinely beaten up to 800 times with a paddle or electric cord. The 36-year-old <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> made emotional appearances on local radio and television talk shows. He wept before a national audience on The <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> Show and pleaded with <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> to help him. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> first accused the media of `` murder in the first degree'' in his daughter's death. Later, <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> simply denied that his daughter was beaten to death. He dropped out of sight as jury selection began, and said he planned to reflect on the group's problems and sort out his own feelings. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> formed Ecclesia at the <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1975, saying he wanted to steer children away from drugs and crime and to motivate them through tough discipline and athletic training. At one time, he said he wanted to prepare the children to compete in the Olympics. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> said the defense team had not seen <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> since he returned from his retreat. However, <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> will be called to testify and is expected to appear, <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> said. Although he denied exercising undue influence over members of the group, <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> led parents in confrontations with state officials after their children were placed in protective custody. The court-appointed defense attorneys threatened to step aside when their clients became uncooperative in the weeks after the killing, but agreed to stay on after <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> talked to the defendants. The Ecclesia children still in foster homes come from 16 families. Their parents, saying they wanted to protest violation of their constitutional rights, stopped visiting the children a month ago, and <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> said the decision was a `` serious impediment'' to efforts to reunite the families. `` Once they ceased visits, that was it,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The children range in age from 9 months to 16 years. Many are in school, some for the first time, said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> of the state children's agency. The trial will be one of the first in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> to be televised. Acting under new rules, <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> issued a set of strict guidelines giving television stations limited access to the courtroom. Newspaper photographers also may be allowed access to the trial.

 The Christian Democrat and Revolutionary Febrerista parties nominated presidential candidates Sunday, refusing to join other opposition parties in a coalition for the May 1 elections. Their actions also ended speculation they might boycott the elections because the provisional government of Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON> rejected proposals to postpone the elections and make major changes in the electoral laws. At separate weekend conventions the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> nominated <PERSON> Secundino </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>, a former Roman Catholic priest, and the Febreristas named retired economist <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> to run for the presidency. The elections were called by the government of provisional President <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> who led the Feb. 3 military coup that ousted President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, an army general who ruled <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> for nearly 35 years. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 65, is the candidate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and is virtually certain of winning the election against the splintered opposition. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION>, in power since 1947, also are expected to retain control of the national legislature in the balloting. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, Febreristas and <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> formed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION> to oppose the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is to told its convention March 25-26 and if it decides to participate in the balloting it is expected to nominate former exile and longtime opposition leader <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> for president. <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> addressed party rallies over the weekend and spoke of irregularities in voter registration. He also said there was the threat of a `` great fraud'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION>. The National Accord had asked the provisional government to postpone the elections for at least two months, to extend voter registration, to allow coalitions and not just individual parties to back a single candidate, and to revoke the law that gives two-thirds of the legislative seats to the party that wins the most votes. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>' government rejected the appeals to postpone elections or extend the voter registration period and ignored the other requests. It did remove restrictions that barred the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and Authentic Radicals from participating and gave all legal parties access to the state-run media. The Communist Party remained banned. <PERSON> Sedundino </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>, 68, told his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, `` God has given us the circumstances and the people are urging us to act. We have to take advantage of the political opening right now.'' He is a professor of theology and anthropology at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and compared his party's participation in the elections to a `` long walk through a swamp after someone has rescued you from a deep well.'' `` But must we wait for an angel to come down and clear the way for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to begin to move forward?'' he asked the party delegates. `` No!'' they shouted back. Febrerista candidate <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> is 65.

 Discovery returned from its five-day mission in what appeared to be the best condition of any space shuttle, with only minor damage to its protective tiles, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said Sunday. A preliminary examination indicated only 10 thermal protection tiles will need to be replaced, in contrast to the last shuttle flight in December when nearly 200 tiles were severely damaged. In addition, the tires, brakes and engines that troubled some previous missions performed well. `` We need to go back and look -LRB- at mission records -RRB- but I doubt if we could even find one that looks this good,'' said Discovery Flow Director <PERSON> Tip </PERSON> <PERSON> Talone </PERSON>, who coordinates processing of the orbiter for each flight. A day after landing, Discovery underwent processing at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s facility as 28 mph winds, with gusts over 43 mph, churned dust clouds across <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, slightly hampering work on the shuttle. Talone, however, expected Discovery to leave on time for its ferry flight to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Friday morning. Technicians counted only 82 `` hits'' on Discovery's tiles and only 15 were bigger than one inch, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Honeycutt </PERSON>, director of shuttle management and operations at Kennedy Space Center. The previous shuttle mission ended with 707 debris hits on the orbiter. `` This is one of the best yet,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, a director for the shuttle tile system that shields orbiters from the fiery re-entry. `` We've had no major damages, there's a few dings ... around the nose cap, nothing severe at all.'' Five tiles were damaged when wires connected to a tire pressure monitor snapped as the right main landing gear dropped, Ms. <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON> said. Only one of those five tiles will need to be replaced, she said. The two 10-inch wires and printed circuit board from the pressure monitor were found on the runway. <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said the wires, which run down the landing gear strut, apparently got tangled and yanked the circuit board out when the gear came down. Discovery landed at 6:36 a.m. Saturday on a paved runway rather than the hardpan of <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> for a test of `` moderate'' pressure on the brakes. Discovery's brakes were removed shortly after landing and sent to the manufacturer for inspection. Engineers said `` the brakes looked the best ever. No signs of any heat; there was no damage whatsoever,'' <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said. The craft's wheels to Kennedy Space Center for recycling. Shuttle brakes were problematic through most of the program until shuttles were redesigned to steer with the nose wheel rather than alternate pressure on the main gear. `` It's obvious we're starting to turn the corner on the brake problems,'' <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said. All the tires looked good, and although one showed wear, it was not a safety concern, <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said. He added that it looks like <ORGANIZATION> Discovery </ORGANIZATION>'s `` engines came through in flying colors again.'' Discovery blasted off Monday from <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and in six hours accomplished its major goal, deploying a $ 100 million Tracking and Data Relay Satellite. On Tuesday the crew had to shut down non-essential lighting and computers because of erratic flow from a hydrogen tank feeding a system supplying electricity to the shuttle. Officials considered shortening the mission by one day, but by Wednesday ground controllers had solved the problem. <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said the hydrogen tank system would be inspected when the orbiter returned to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON>, the space agency's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> director, indicated at a post-landing news conference on Saturday that the hydrogen tank may not have had a problem. `` In the end, I think we've concluded that was not a serious problem and perhaps no malfunction at all,'' but simply behavior inherent in a system delivering super-cold material, <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON> said. When <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is confident the braking and steering system work under a variety of conditions shuttles might resume landings at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. Since 1985, when Discovery blew a tire and damaged another on the 16th shuttle mission, all landings have been made on the wide-open lakebed at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator for space flight, indicated at the press conference that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will not soon forego <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` It's a great place to bring the orbiter back to and I think we'll continue to plan on coming out here for a considerable period of time,'' Truly said. Discovery's flight was the 28th shuttle mission and third since flights resumed after the explosion of Challenger, which killed its seven crew members and brought a long suspension of the shuttle program. Discovery's crew, Commander <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON>, and mission specialists <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON>, returned to <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> shortly after touchdown. During the mission, they also worked on a variety of experiments, including growing plants and crystals in microgravity, and monitoring experiments of the effect of microgravity on development of chicken embryos and the healing of intentionally injured bones in four rats. The crew also filmed the Earth for a documentary on the effects of pollution and other environmental damage.

 Only minutes before the fighting began, a megaphone broke the predawn Sunday silence, warning a rightist member of the local election board the rebels were coming after him. Then guerrillas of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> attacked, bombing power poles and exchanging fire with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops on the rocky edges of this little town of 3,600. The fighting went on for nearly five hours, residents said, ending only two hours before the polls opened at 7 a.m. The guerrillas had promised not to attack polling places or people who wished to vote, but even so the early turnout was light, poll officials said. Many blamed it on fear. `` There is no question that the intimidation of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> is working,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> said. `` The people are frightened.'' One of the worst cases of nerves belonged, by his own admission, to <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, 33. `` I am afraid,'' said <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, a supporter of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, and an alternate member of the local election board. The guerrillas have denied that they threatened poll workers with death, but <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> and others said he was singled out. `` They said: ` <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, we know your turf. Expect us. We are coming for you,''' he recalled tensely as mortars thudded in the distance. A few blocks away, on the hilly edge of town, repairs were under way on modest homes pocked by bullets or damaged by bombed utility poles, a favorite rebel target. A man patching bullet holes in his front door was asked if he was going to the polls. `` If I have time after this,'' he said grimly, gesturing at his plane and saw. Worshippers leaving Palm Sunday mass streamed past polling places in the own square. Few stopped to vote. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION>, which lies in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vicente </LOCATION> province, was only one of the theaters of battle on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s election day. The pattern was similiar elsewhere, with bombs and bullets setting nerves on edge in the hours before the voting began. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION>, 30 miles east of the capital, reported no casualties. In <LOCATION> Ilobasco </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Cabanas </LOCATION> province about 35 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, there was death. But people still streamed to the polls. The bodies of two recently killed guerrillas, a teen-age girl and a young man, lay on concrete slabs in the small open pavillion at the town cemetery that serves as the morgue.

 A man from <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> has been charged with illegally exporting 70 tons of elephant ivory worth $ 9.8 million, a newspaper said Sunday. A court also charged <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulaiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfan </PERSON> Saturday with unlawfully possessing 853 hippopotamus teeth valued at $ 224, according to the Sunday News. Police said <PERSON> Alfan </PERSON> shipped the tusks on March 7 to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, according to the news report. If convicted, <PERSON> Alfan </PERSON> faces a possible 14 years in prison under <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>'s Economic and Organized Crime Control Act. The report did not specify whether <PERSON> Alfan </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, both on the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. According to East African conservationists, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> has become the major distributing center for illegal elephant ivory. High international prices for ivory continue to fuel widespread poaching that already has cut <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s elephant population in half since the late 1970s, according to a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> study. In January, the government intercepted 184 elephant tusks being smuggled out of the country by former <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Joesoef </PERSON>. No legal action was taken against the diplomat, but the government asked him immediately to leave the country.

 Heavy snow fell Sunday over portions of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> and bitter cold weather set records in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, but most of the nation enjoyed relatively mild, dry weather. Ten inches of snow fell at the <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> ski area in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and a snow advisory was in effect for elevations above 6,000 feet in the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> mountains. A snow advisory also was posted for southwest <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and the mountains of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. The tail end of a <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> storm brought only light precipitation to northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but officials there rejoiced that the weekend storm had brought vital rainfall to the drought-plagued region. `` Conditions are still far below normal in too many areas to say the drought is over,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>, statewide drought coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. `` But it has eased considerably everywhere, with the exception of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>.'' Showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered across the south-central <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but rainfall was generally not heavy. Dry weather prevailed over much of the rest of the country and skies were fair to partly sunny most places east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. A cold front in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> brought brisk winds to parts of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and a wind advisory was posted for desert and mountain areas. Gusts to 50 mph were reported in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. Temperatures were generally below freezing from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> through the Great Lakes region to northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and in the 70s and 80s across parts of the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and Southeast. Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 19 degrees at <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, to 88 degrees at <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Authorities who unearthed bones and an apparent clothing fragment at a site identified by serial killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> hope to determine this week whether they belonged to one of his victims. It is not yet clear whether the bones are those of a human being, <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ekker </PERSON> said the state medical examiner's office will receive the bones on Monday or Tuesday, and try to determine whether they were those of 17-year-old <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, who disappeared from her <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhood on Oct. 2, 1974. Forensic testing should be finished by Thursday or Friday, he said. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was executed Jan. 24 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s electric chair. For years he had claimed he was innocent of all wrongdoing, but in the days before he died, he confessed to killing at least 23 women in several Western states. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, he said, he had killed eight girls and women. He identified only three, among them <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, who he said was buried near <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, 200 miles south of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The sheriff also acknowledged that he was conferring with an unidentified <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> psychic who claims to be able to pinpoint the <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> burial site. `` I'm going to take a long shot. I'm desperate at this point,'' <PERSON> Ekker </PERSON> said. He added that if the medical examiner determines the bones are not human, no further searches will be conducted. The bones, including what <PERSON> Ekker </PERSON> said appeared to be a shoulder blade, were found by searchers Friday at one of three sites a mile east of the park. Also found with the shoulder blade-like bone was a fragment of what appeared to be a tan blouse. Bones at the first two sites were believed to be those of animals. The blouse `` was deteriorated to the point that it could have been 14 -LCB- years ago'' when it was buried, <PERSON> Ekker </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> was wearing a blouse of unknown color when she disappeared, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Detective <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. The other two women <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> identified among his <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> victims were <PERSON> Debi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, 17, who was last seen alive Nov. 8, 1974, at Bountiful's <ORGANIZATION> Viewmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, 15, who disappeared from the <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus in <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION> on June 27, 1975 <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> also gave general directions to the graves of <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> and <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> before he was executed. The search for <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>' remains is under way, and law enforcement officers say they soon will look for <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION>'s body.

<HEAD>Gunmen Kill Man In Belfast Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gunmen killed a Roman Catholic man in his north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> home on Sunday, police said, in what appeared to be the latest in a series of retaliatory sectarian slayings. The attackers burst into the man's house, shot him at close range and escaped, police said. Press Association, the British domestic news agency, identified the victim as 63-year-old <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Braniff </PERSON>. He was the third person slain in north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> in four days, and his death brings to 24 the number killed this year in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s battle between Catholic and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> civil servant <PERSON> Niall </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, 42, was fatally shot at his home, apparently in retaliation for the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> killing the night before of Protestant <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvine </PERSON>, 49, shot dead when two gunmen smashed their way into his house. The <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Brigade of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, fighting to drive the British out of the province, claimed <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> was an active member of an outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary group and said there were clear indications he was involved in recent sectarian slayings of Catholics. The latest round of such slayings began Feb. 12 when <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>, who acted for clients allegedly involved with the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, was killed by gunmen who stormed his home in north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. An outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary group, the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility for his death, saying he was an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> officer. His widow denied the allegation. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> wants to unite predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> with the 95 percent <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under socialist rule. On Feb. 14, gunmen killed <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> councilman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> as he drove to his home in the village of <LOCATION> Glenduff </LOCATION> 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. No group claimed responsibility. On Feb. 16, gunmen burst into a Protestant bar in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and opened fire, injuring five people. The Irish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a Marxist offshoot of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility. On March 8, <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gunmen shot three Protestants to death outside a gas station. On March 10, gunmen opened fire on two men leaving a Catholic bar in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, killing one and wounding another.

 Club-wielding Turkish Cypriot policemen scuffled Sunday with <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> women trying to breach <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' dividing Green Line to walk to their former homes in the Turkish-occupied north of the island Nine women were injured and 32 were detained as they tried to break through a cordon of police and unarmed Turkish soldiers while Turkish military helicopters buzzed overhead. Twenty-one other women and a male news photographer were detained as about 3,500 protesters tried to cross the line patrolled by 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers. Helicopters of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force hovered low, monitoring the women. Ten of the detainees were freed in the evening and the remainder shortly before midnight at the Green Line checkpoint in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island's divided capital, a police statement said. Earlier in the day at <LOCATION> Lymbia </LOCATION>, 19 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, about 1,500 women carrying white flags and banners saying `` We come in peace'' climbed up the hill to the whitewashed chapel of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> that serves as a Turkish Cypriot guard post. About 100 soldiers and policemen prepared to halt the advance. A banner hanging from the church said in English, `` Better apart than dead!'' About 100 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers crested the hill and separated the Turkish Cypriots from the women. But the Turkish soldiers dodged behind the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops and pushed the women down the hill. The other group, including 100 supporters from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, took over a church in the deserted village of <LOCATION> Akhna </LOCATION>, 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Achna </ORGANIZATION> has been deserted, except for a garrison, since Turkish troops invaded northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in 1974, ostensibly to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority after a coup by Greek Cypriot militants advocating union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The `` Women Walk Home'' march is spearheaded by women among 200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees, a third of the island's population, who fled the north in the wake of the Turkish invasion. Some 40,000 Turkish Cypriots fled from the south. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> maintains 30,000 troops in the north, where Turkish Cypriots proclaimed a breakaway state in 1983. The women want to arouse international indignation to put pressure on <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. One of their leaders is <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, the estranged <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wife of Greek Prime Minister <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> needs to be pushed. ... They are not doing enough,'' she said Saturday. `` All the women are doing is demanding the right to go back to their homes, a right which is guaranteed by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.''

<TEXT>
 With bells heralding their arrival, the swallows made their official return to Mission <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capistrano </LOCATION> on Sunday, even though some of the birds were spotted at least a month earlier. Thousands of tourists gathered at the site to get a glimpse of the birds on their traditional St. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s Day return, which falls this year on Palm Sunday. The swallows were sparse, though, when 94-year-old <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbiso </PERSON> began his annual rite of tolling the mission courtyard bells at 7:57 a.m. `` For the air fare that I paid from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, I wanted swarms,'' said <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn-Holzworth </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> student who came to <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for spring break. On Saturday, the 31st Annual Swallows Parade attracted an estimated 2,000 spectators, said sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>. First accounts of the swallows coming to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capistrano </LOCATION> on their spring migration northward date back to 1776. That was the year Father <PERSON> Junipero </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> founded the picturesque mission as part of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s effort to spread the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> faith _ and the influence of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> _ in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION>. Legend has it that the swallows have failed to arrive in <PERSON> Capistrano </PERSON> once, in 1935, when they were held up by a storm. The official arrival of the swallows was n't <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s power landing this weekend That distinction belonged to the space shuttle Discovery. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Minerva </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION> recently from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, went out of their way for the event, even bypassing a hometown turnoff on Highway 58 that would have taken them right to the shuttle's landing site at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're kind of discovering <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. We figured it was either the space shuttle or the swallows,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> said. Despite the high expectations, however, on Sunday television camera crews had to resort to throwing pebbles at the mission walls to get the birds to take flight for the proper dramatic effect. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Chauncey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> craned a home video camera around and around, looking for at least one good swallow flight to record. `` I'm not disappointed. Why be disappointed? I've got my health. It's nice weather. And I might get some good pictures,'' <PERSON> Chauncey </PERSON> said. At least one bird-watcher said the swallows actually got a one-month head start on the tourists. The first of the birds reached <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in February from their winter homes in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries, said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wohlgemuth </PERSON>, a birder with the <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>. The birds' numbers at the mission have dwindled in recent years, and urban sprawl has covered much of the area, but they still find places to flock, <PERSON> Magalousis </PERSON> said. `` Swallow's day is one of those popular things that most bird watchers do n't pay much attention to,'' said <PERSON> Wohlgemuth </PERSON>. `` But you ca n't knock it or try to debunk it. After all, how many times does a bird get in the news?''

 Convicted child-killer <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> is one of 26 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state lawyers whose clients were awarded a total of $ 1 million from a state fund to compensate the victims of unscrupulous lawyers, the executive director of the fund said Sunday. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s client, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Liss </PERSON>, was awarded $ 400 from the fund to compensate him for money he placed in escrow with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> to settle a lawsuit for his sister, said <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the state Clients' Security Fund. `` Mr. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> has not responded,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` We sent him a claim. ... It could very well be he still has the money -LRB- in escrow. -RRB-'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was convicted Jan. 30 of first-degree manslaughter in the Nov. 5, 1987, death of 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, whom he had raised with his companion, <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>. He faces a maximum eight and one-third to 25-year prison term when he is sentenced on Friday. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the missing escrow money was delivered to <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> `` shortly before his arrest in connection with <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, who was disbarred last year, was one of 26 lawyers _ all now dead or disbarred _ whose clients received awards from the fund in the last three months, said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Every practicing attorney in the state contributes $ 50 every two years to finance the Clients' Security Fund, which provides up to $ 100,000 coverage to individual clients and $ 200,000 for estates and trusts with two or more beneficiaries. Since 1982, the fund has returned more than $ 9 million to victims of dishonest lawyers. Another award involved the largest loss ever reported to the fund: the alleged embezzlement of $ 1.1 million by <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, who is believed to have fled the country with his clients' money, was disbarred in February and is the object of an international police search, said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. His client, <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Duba </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, gave him $ 1.1 million to be placed in escrow. The money was to be used to eliminate single room occupancy restrictions on some <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> real estate so that maids' quarters could be converted into a penthouse apartment, said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duba </PERSON> was awarded $ 100,000, the largest monetary award for individual clients, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Two other claims are pending against <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, including one involving more than $ 2 million, said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>.

 The governing party's candidate won a third term as provincial governor by a sharply reduced margin Sunday in one of two elections considered a test of the scandal-embroiled Liberal Democrats. In <LOCATION> Miyagi </LOCATION> prefecture in northeast <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Shuntaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Honma </PERSON> easily won election as governor Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aichi </PERSON> had withdrawn after admitting he received more than $ 60,000 from a company accused of influence peddling and insider trading. Three Cabinet ministers have resigned because of links with the company, and the scandal and a new sales tax have sent Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s popularity to a record low. In the final tally of the prefectural election in <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s eastern neighbor, incumbent governor <PERSON> Takeshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Numata </PERSON>, 66, garnered 971,687 votes, while <PERSON> Shoji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishii </PERSON>, who was supported by the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Communist Party, got 786,238 votes, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported The voter turnout was 47.3 percent, compared to 30.70 percent in the previous gubernatorial election. The prefecture, traditionally a conservative stronghold, elected <PERSON> Numata </PERSON> in 1985 with 781,000 votes to 271,000 for his opponent, also a Communist. <PERSON> Numata </PERSON>'s sharply narrower margin of victory in the election could indicate trouble for the ruling party in voting scheduled this summer for half of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s upper house, where it holds 143 of 251 seats. Large losses in those elections would endanger <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s chances in October to win another two-year term as party president and prime minister Opposition parties are already calling on <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to resign. In the <PERSON> Miyagi </PERSON> race, a final tally showed that <PERSON> Honma </PERSON>, 49, received 502,372 votes, compared to 140,979 for <PERSON> Seiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, a conservative independent, and 125,016 for <PERSON> Yoshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoji </PERSON>, who was supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said. The voter turnout was 49.56 percent, the lowest turnout in a prefectural gubernatorial election since the end of World War II. Voter turnout in the 1985 election was 50.40 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information conglomerate, reportedly offered hundreds of thousands of unlisted shares in a real-estate subsidiary at bargain prices to more than 150 influential people, including politicians and businessmen. Recipients reaped handsome profits by selling the shares after public trading began. Prosecutors have arrested a dozen people in connection with the scandal. The Liberal Democrats were stung at polls last month, when they lost a parliamentary by-election in <LOCATION> Fukuoka </LOCATION> prefecture to a candidate representing their strongest rival, the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. A poll published Saturday by <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s second largest newspaper, showed support for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> plunged to 15 percent, his worst rating and the third-lowest level in postwar history.

<HEAD>Once Again Gas Prices Top Off Over the Dollar Mark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The average price of gasoline topped off over the dollar mark for the second time this month, an industry analyst said Sunday. On March 17, the national average price of gasoline for the past two weeks was 100.37 cents a gallon, including all grades, types of service and taxes, said the analyst, <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON>. The jump reflects a month-long trend in increases at the pump and the result of rising wholesale prices. According to the recent nationwide survey, the retail price of gasoline was up 1.05 cents a gallon since March 3, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. A rise in both crude oil and refined products caused wholesalers to raise prices, which in turn caused retailers to pass the increase on to customers, she added. Self-service prices on March 17 were 90.09 cents per gallon for regular unleaded, 106.24 for premium unleaded, and 87.72 for regular leaded. Full-service prices were 118.72 cents per gallon for regular unleaded, 130.08 for premium unleaded and 115.13 for regular leaded.

 Gun manufacturers should follow the example of <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and stop nonmilitary sales of semiautomatic assault rifles, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. `` I thought that was a very courageous action on the part of Colt. Guns are dangerous, law enforcement is suffering because of these guns,'' <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` Face the Nation.'' `` I am asking them to -LRB- take this action -RRB-, on behalf of the officers who are in danger every single day, because a police officer dies every 57 hours in this country,'' said Lawn. But Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and the new drug czar, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, said they did not think the government should call for private manufacturers to stop retail sales of semiautomatic weapons. Colt announced that it was suspending sales of its AR-15 semiautomatic rifle starting last Thursday, the day after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided to ban temporarily the import of foreign-made assault rifles. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> called for debate on whether the federal government should ban all nonmilitary sales of semiautomatic weapons or urge private companies to voluntarily suspend sales. `` As an official of the federal government, I do n't want to speak in such ways that suggest that I'm pushing them in any direction or another,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, Meet the Press. But he added: `` I think we can make the case that we do n't need a whole lot more assault rifles on our streets right now.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said a comprehensive solution was needed. `` If we think that the only way to deal with the drug problem is to ban a particular type of weapon, we're dead wrong,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he opposed any ban on assault weapons and advocated stiff mandatory jail sentences for anyone convicted of using a weapon in the commission of a crime. Addressing the issue of drug use in nation's capital, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he had not yet decided whether to declare the federal district a `` high intensity drug trafficking area,'' enabling him to assemble a government strike force to fight drug dealing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. As of Sunday, 118 murders had been reported in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> so far this year, a record rate, and police say that nearly all are drug-related. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, quoting unidentified <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> aides, reported in its Sunday editions that the strike force would target repeat drug offenders, try to shut down the city's 90 open-air drug markets, and use abandoned military facilities as temporary prisons for drug offenders. `` We did not declare <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a high-intensity drug-trafficking area,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` We are looking at whether we should do that or not.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` Several mayors wrote to us and said, ` We, too, want to be high-intensity drug trafficking areas.' `` People need to be careful before they seek that designation,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` This is not a good thing to be. Maybe some additional federal assistance will be available once this designation occurs, but in many ways, it's an admission that the city has failed to conduct its business in a way that can keep it's streets safe for the citizenry. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, asked whether he was bothered by allegations that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was involved with cocaine, replied, `` Well, sure it troubles me. I think it troubles everybody. `` If you've got all these allegations going around, it hurts the credibility of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But I do n't think we have to be so dainty as to say, ` Well, if we have disagreements or problems with the mayor, we're going to ignore the city.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was asked on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> whether he used drugs. `` Absolutely not,'' he said. But he brushed aside persistent questions about whether he would resign, saying, `` The issue is not <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> declined to discuss allegations against <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, saying `` those are all matters that are under investigation by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and, obviously, I'm not going to comment on them.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> urged federal authorities to use force against Latin American nations that produce illegal drugs. `` The national government needs to go to these five or six countries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, send the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> _ burn up those fields, eradicate those coco leaves ... blow up those labs, stop it at the source,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. After the broadcast, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> told reporters that if a federal strike force is sent to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` I wonder what they are going to do.'' `` If he -LRB- <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> -RRB- thinks these murders are going to be curbed by more federal police, then more power to him,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Party Leader Says Poland Faces Historic Challenge, But Warns Of Subversion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> told a regional party meeting that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has a historic chance to evolve its system by introducing a `` socialist parliamentary democracy,'' in a speech televised Sunday. But <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, speaking to party activists in the southern city of <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION> on Saturday, said the party must be prepared to face challenges for political power from the opposition. In the speech published by the state news service <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> and shown in part on state television, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> argued that such competition could be healthy but that the party would `` show vigilance'' against those who seek to undermine the political system, public order, state institutions and the economy. A week ago, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> made a similar speech to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> party activists. The speeches seemed directed toward averting any revolt among lower - and middle-level party activists, some of whom are extremely wary of <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s proposed pact with the opposition <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, first secretary of the Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party, spoke to a conference of the 240,000-member party organization of the heavily industrialized <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> region. It is the largest regional party organization in the country and considered a bastion of hard-line opposition to reform within the party. <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION>'s party-controlled mining and steel industries are criticized by economic reformers as being unprofitable and for consuming a disproportionate share of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s resources. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> defended his own moves toward economic and political reform and the decision to negotiate with the opposition at broad-based `` round-table'' talks, which began Feb. 6 and are to end April 3. Authorities hope the talks will guarantee social stability so that planned economic reforms can work. So far they have yielded general accord on several key points _ legalizing the banned Solidarity trade union federation, allowing a 35 percent opposition bloc in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and having fully free elections for a new senate. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> told the Katowice audience the party is trying to create `` a correct model of socialist parliamentary democracy and political and trade union pluralism.'' `` The future of what we, as the first ones, have decided to introduce depends on proving that the presence of the opposition in political and social life does not give rise to confrontation but yields sound competition,'' he said. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said it was logical that the opposition would strive for power. But he added: `` We will show the necessary vigilance and firmness'' toward those who struggle against the political system or try to undermine state institutions.

 A blind escaped murderer was shot to death and his partner captured early Sunday when police stormed a townhouse and freed two children who had been held hostage for more than a day. The blind fugitive, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, was holding a knife to the throat of 6-year-old Cameo <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> when police shot him in the face, authorities said. The girl and her brother, 8-year-old <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON>, had been held hostage since Friday afternoon at their home in this <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> suburb. `` The children seemed perfectly fine when we found them,'' police Capt. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. `` They cried and said they missed their mother.'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s accomplice, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, was taken into custody, police said. He suffered a minor injury and was treated at a hospital before being jailed, police Chief <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> escaped from <ORGANIZATION> Stillwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> on Friday morning while being escorted by two guards to a medical office, where he had an appointment to get a replacement glass eye. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, wearing a Halloween mask, met <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> at the office and the two men disarmed the guards, tied them up and fled, police said. They then went to the townhouse of <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, the children's mother, who had corresponded with <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> in prison Her sister-in-law, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> broke off the relationship more than 18 months ago when she discovered <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> had been convicted of strangling his girlfriend. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said she did n't believe the two had ever met face to face before Friday. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 49, was sentenced to 27 years in prison for second-degree murder in 1982 and had prior convictions for two counts of rape, as well as robbery, criminal sexual assault, burglary and illegal handgun possession, according to <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowdle </PERSON>, associate warden at the <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> prison. <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, assistant to the warden that the <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> prison, said <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s medical records indicate he became legally blind in the early 1980s as a result of glaucoma. His vision later grew progressively worse, officials said. Police identified <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, his accomplice, as a former <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> inmate who served a five-year sentence for aggravated assault. He was returned to prison for violating parole but was released in January. Police negotiated with the men throughout the day Saturday as more than 100 SWAT officers ringed the building. <LOCATION> Apple </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> police were joined by officers from surrounding communities, state and county agencies and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` Basically, they said they had to be allowed to leave. If they did n't, they were going to throw a dead child out,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. At one point, police seized <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> when she was sent by the the two men to start a car in what authorities described as an escape attempt. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said she struggled with officers when they refused to allow her to return to her children. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> was taken to a hospital for treatment of exhaustion and stress. She left the hospital late Saturday night and went to a relative's house, <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> said. Finally, at 1:30 a.m. Sunday, police decided to storm the building when one of the children came out to pick up soft drinks that authorities had sent to the townhouse, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. Police threw at least two stun grenades into the house and a special weapons and tactics team went in. `` We basically had a hard decision to make as to when the best opportunity would present itself and we had to be ready to go when it did,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. `` As you know, we were dealing with some very desperate men. It was unacceptable to allow the men to leave with the children.''

 The dissident <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group threatened Sunday to assassinate Palestinians who make direct contact with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders. In a statement sent to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, Fatah-Uprising particularly mentioned people `` considered by the enemy close to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.'' It gave no names in the threat, which apparently was designed to jeopardize <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s peace initiative. <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION>, a Syrian-backed group led by Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>, broke away from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> movement in 1983. Its statement said that as the 15-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> continues `` some Palestinian personalities are conducting contacts and meetings with the enemy which may lead to disastrous results. `` We consider these meetings an attempt to liquidate the uprising. Therefore, we stress that the guns of the Palestinian revolution will put an end to the life of anybody who may be tempted to abuse the destiny of the Palestinian people and its sacred cause,'' said the statement signed by <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Omlah </PERSON>. On Friday, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said several Palestinians have been meeting with the Israelis. In an interview with the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> Arabic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION> he named <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON>; <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, editor of a Palesinian newspaper, and <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, recently released after months of detention by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said the four were not <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members but were in contact <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s movement. Guerrillas of Fatah-Uprising infiltrated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from southern <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on Friday in another bid to torpedo <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s peace efforts. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said its security forces later arrested the guerrillas. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in December renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in an attempt to open negotiations with the Jewish state, but <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders so far have rejected his overtures. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told the Italian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> last week that he is willing to go to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to pursue peace talks provided he gets `` full consent'' from Arab countries. The announcement drew sharp criticism from Fatah-Uprising and the Damascus-based Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which described <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> as `` a traitor and an imperialist agent.'' Another guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, called on Arab countries Sunday to exert `` extreme pressure'' on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to accept the establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. In a statement sent to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, it said its Politburo member <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Ghosh </PERSON> made the call at a rally in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The rally marked the 20th anniversary of the Marxist group, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The statement referred to the expected resumption of talks between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and said: `` The dialogue between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration is not an end in itself. `` The Americans have to stop prevaricating in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s favor and accept convening an international peace conference as a viable framework for settlement,'' it said.

 Federal agents said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Landreth </PERSON> could once crack into the computer networks used by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. But now, awash in waves of emotional depression, he lives in the streets. The 24-year old computer whiz with a genius IQ, who as a teen-ager was the target of a highly publicized <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> crackdown on computer hackers, now spends his days on park benches and his nights in shelters and concrete doorways. Known at the height of his fame by his code name `` The Hacker,'' <PERSON> Landreth </PERSON> has all but dropped out of society, saying mood-altering drugs and antidepressants could n't ward off the depression that has dogged him. But <PERSON> Landreth </PERSON> said in an interview with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times that he remains confident in his ability to control computers, and could make lots of money using his talents. But he said he must live by his own rules. `` I could set up a data base system for a company and walk away with a few thousand dollars for five or six hours work, and they'd never regret it,'' he said `` The five or six thousand for five or six hours of work would interest me, but I have n't fallen for it. `` I did n't inherit a great deal of money that's been accumulating for several eons, so I would n't know how to look at money,'' he said. <PERSON> Landreth </PERSON> gained notoriety in 1983 when the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> cracked down on him and other hackers. With an IQ measured at 186, well into the genius category, <PERSON> Landreth </PERSON> was accused of breaking into the Virginia-based <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telemail </ORGANIZATION> electronic mail network to take a look at computer correspondence from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Landreth </PERSON> eventually pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud, was fined $ 87 for using computer time he did n't pay for and was placed on three years' probation. During his legal problems, <PERSON> Landreth </PERSON> appeared to be in control of his life, giving lectures to business executives, doing freelance computer work and promoting a book about his experiences, `` Out of the Inner Circle,'' which has sold about 68,000 copies. But in September 1986, <PERSON> Landreth </PERSON> disappeared, leaving behind a rambling, eight-page essay touching on such subjects as man's evolution and immortality, communism and capitalism, nuclear war and greed, and suicide `` I was bored in school, bored traveling around the country, bored getting raided by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, bored in prison, bored writing books, bored being bored,'' read the last page. `` I will probably be bored dead, but this is my risk to take.'' <PERSON> Landreth </PERSON> drifted for almost a year, turning up in the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Minnville </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, where he was arrested for violating his probation. He was sent back to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, where he found that he had about $ 9,000 waiting for him in book royalties from foreign sales. He rented an apartment, but it burned down. He eventually landed on the streets. `` The way I see it, I could be retired in five or 10 years, if I did things in a constructive way,'' he said. `` But I have n't decided to do that.'' He prefers, for now, to live by his own definition of freedom, even though he knows some of his friends and family think he's wasting his life `` I do n't know what -LRB- freedom -RRB- is good for any more than anyone else knows what it's good for,'' he said. `` So it's really in how you look at it.''

 Demands for an independent inquiry into <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s handling of warnings received before the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 will grow until the government explains its actions, an opposition party leader said Sunday Also Sunday, the government acknowledged that a December warning about possible bombs on airliners was not mailed until after Jan. 1 _ at least 11 days after the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet blew up and crashed, killing 270 people. `` We can not afford ` bag it and bin it' policies of British official secrecy on matters of security which affect every air traveler across the world,'' said <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON>, leader of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> `` must come clean on all the circumstances surrounding the advance warning,'' <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Unless he comes to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> at the earliest opportunity next week and is competely candid in every detail, the demand for an official inquiry on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> will become irresistible,'' he said. Those demanding an independent inquiry include the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and relatives of those killed when Flight 103 exploded over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, Dec. 21 on a flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Investigators say the disaster was caused by a bomb concealed in a radio-cassette player packed in luggage in the plane's hold. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said Sunday he told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> `` as much as it is in my power to tell.'' Government ministers `` should not go around revealing things that might be against the national interest,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said he welcomed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s decision to send top aides to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to assess aviation security <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he wants his officials to determine, among other things, when and how warnings were made against <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights last year. `` The investigators have been working extremely closely with the Americans at all stages, and I think if they come over here, and the investigators have further talks with them, that can only be a very good thing,'' <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said. `` There is keen public concern in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in this country about the progress of this investigation and it's not surprising that people should wish to come over and have further talks.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed last week it prepared a warning dated Dec. 19 that included photographs of a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player but did not mail it until after Christmas. But on Sunday, a department spokesman said the warning was not sent until the New Year because the accompanying photos had to be prepared. The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, did not give the exact date of the mailing. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> has said the letter was of little importance because similar information had been sent out a month earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and changed planes at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> before setting out for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Two <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspapers, The Observer and The Sunday Telegraph, reported Sunday that the Dec. 19 warning carried several important details that would have helped security people spot a rigged radio-cassette player. Another <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, reported that the man who made the bomb is a Libyan known to international security officials as `` The Professor'' because of his knowledge of explosives. The Sunday Express attributed its information to unidentified detectives. It did not identify the man by name. The Express also said a Lebanese student, 21-year-old <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaafar </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, unwittingly carried the bomb onto the flight in a radio-cassette player given to him as a gift. It did not say who gave it to him. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has questioned <PERSON> Jaafar </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Nazir </PERSON>, who has denied earlier reports in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British newspapers that his son may have brought the bomb on the plane without knowing it. Also Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported that the bombing of Flight 103 was surrounded by serious mistakes in security at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The network said it obtained a memo from the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> dated Dec. 29 which conceded that baggage coming from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> was transferred directly to the jet headed for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> without being screened. The memo also said a passenger arriving late at the departure gate was not allowed to fly to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but his baggage stayed on _ a violation of security rules. The memo did not say who the passenger was or give other details, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A gunman who killed one child and wounded two others had a history of mental problems and was a target of frequent harassment by adolescents in his suburban neighborhood, according to neighbors and police. The gunman, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON>, was shot and killed by a police officer Saturday night after he went on the shooting spree in this bedroom community about 10 miles west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Eight-year-old <PERSON> Kareem </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> remained in critical condition Sunday with a gunshot wound to the head, according to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, associate administrator of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>.

Inside the building where he lived, <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> shot 9-year-old <PERSON> Ivory </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who died Saturday night from her injuries, authorities said. <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> then emerged and began firing his .32 caliber gun, witnesses said. Both <PERSON> Velez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> were outside the building and were hit by shots from <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON>'s gun, police and witnesses said. Police Officer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, from the adjacent town of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, was on a routine patrol at the border of the two towns when he heard the shots. He exchanged fire with <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON>, who was hit with four rounds, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Palardy </PERSON> said. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> -RRB- will definitely receive a letter of commendation from my office for his actions,'' <PERSON> Palardy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was released from <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday after being treated for a grazing gunshot wound on the head, <PERSON> Palardy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON>, 60, was a frequent target of harassment from older teen-agers in the area, according to neighbors. `` Just prior to the tragedy, two young men threw stones at his car,'' <PERSON> Palardy </PERSON> said, adding that the victims were not involved in the incident. <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> was a long-time resident of the neighborhood who worked as a janitor at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. He was hospitalized for nine years for mental instability, according to the police chief. `` His family said he had emotional and mental problems,'' <PERSON> Palardy </PERSON> said. `` I'm not sure of the specifics but they said they were serious.'' <PERSON> Palardy </PERSON> said he did not know when the man had been released. <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> had no prior criminal record, but the gun he used Saturday was not registered, <PERSON> Palardy </PERSON> said.

 A pilot who failed to make a turn flew his aircraft into a snowfield at the 12,500-foot level of Mt. <PERSON> Rainier </PERSON>, authorities said. He was presumed dead in the crash. The pilot, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saul </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION>, requested the turn while flying on instruments and acknowledged that clearance was given, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, regional duty officer with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> went shopping Sunday for the new pilots it needs to survive a crippling strike now in its third week. `` We've waited patiently for the pilots union to come to its senses,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said as an advertisment was run in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> appealing for pilots to `` be part of the new Eastern.'' The ads will begin running Tuesday in other major newspapers across the country, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. The ads promise an `` outstanding opportunity for the very best,'' and try to put the best light on the strike, telling pilots to `` also understand that this is an unprecedented opportunity for growth and success.'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is not lowering its requirements for experience and is offering the same wages and benefits that pilots have been getting under <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Only about 200 of 3,600 Eastern pilots are flying in the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike that began March 4, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged earlier it will live or die on its number of pilots. Eastern is operating under 10 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily flights. It takes at least six weeks to train a pilot who is new to an airline, and Eastern _ whose daily losses are in the millions _ may run out of cash within a few months. On March 9, the airline filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law, and insists it will keep flying with a smaller, cost-effective operation. Pilots union spokesman <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said the advertisements are aimed as much at picketing pilots as at new hires. `` It's twofold,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. `` They want to test the marketplace, and they also want to try to frighten our pilots into thinking they're being replaced. They should have learned by now that intimidation is n't going to work.'' `` They're going to be disappointed,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> predicted. `` There is n't a pool of pilots out there.'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said other major carriers are hiring pilots and offer better working conditions and long-term stability. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> was engaging in `` ALPA propaganda.'' He said Eastern had received more than 100 unsolicited resumes from qualified pilots before the ads began running. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON> said the union probably would challenge any hirings before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, who must approve most of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s expenditures. `` All transactions outside the normal course of business need his approval,'' <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON> said. `` Hiring a new work force is certainly not in the normal course of business. We'll certainly litigate that at the appropriate time.'' Eastern reported light loads on its Northeast shuttle flights Saturday and Sunday. Fares were back to the normal $ 69 weekend rate after the previous weekend's promotional $ 12 fare helped Eastern pack about 62 flights daily between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Some passengers got stranded at airports last weekend because return flights were sold out. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said Eastern was encouraged by last week's weekday shuttle service _ offered at a discount $ 49 a ride _ because it attracted many of the business people who most frequently use the shuttle. The weekday rates return to their normal $ 99 this week. <ORGANIZATION> Mattell </ORGANIZATION> added that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Latin American routes are seeing steadily increasing loads. He declined to comment on a threat Saturday by <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union leader <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON> to organize a sympathy walkout at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> concentrating on the Pan Am Northeast shuttle. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said the company, which has boosted its Northeast shuttle service during the strike, does n't expect a Teamsters walkout `` We believe our employees are n't inclined to take any kind of job action,'' she said Genoese met in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> over the weekend with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> to discuss strategy, including a joint employee buyout effort to combine Eastern with <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. They said that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> routes would complement each other and that joining the carriers would be a way to save both. Both have been beset by labor problems and have lost a total of $ 2 billion in the 1980s. Besides the advertisement for pilots, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> took out full-page ads in leading <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> newspapers calling itself a fighting underdog determined to come back. `` We're going to build a better Eastern for you,'' the ads promise. In another strike-related development, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> announced that it was canceling a dinner to honor Eastern's embattled boss, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> school said the `` emotional climate'' of the labor dispute `` makes it impossible to guarantee an atmosphere appropriate to such a celebratory event.''

Ms. <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, a computer operator from <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, headed home free of malignancy Saturday, hospital officials said.

 Relatives of victims of the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 said Sunday they are outraged by recent disclosures about terrorism warnings made by federal officials before the tragedy. `` It's absolutely ridiculous that they're three months too late,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION>, whose 20-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, was among the 270 people who died in the Dec. 21 crash. `` To comprehend that this could have been avoided is unforgivable.'' <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON>, clutching photographs of her daughter, a junior at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, was among about 100 people who attended a meeting of the Victims of Flight 103 at the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting was organized in the wake of disclosures that at least six <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> security bulletins issued between Oct. 26 and Dec. 19 warned of the type of attack that eventually caused Flight 103 to crash. The jet blew up over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, and investigators have traced the bombing to plastic explosives hidden inside a radio-cassette player. Many of the relatives wore white buttons emblazoned with blue lettering saying `` <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 103 _ The Truth Must be Known.'' Yet the facts surrounding the bombing, which are slowly being released, have provided little relief to those whose loved ones died on the plane. `` The more I hear, the less I want to hear,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Monetti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who wore a button bearing a picture of his smiling son, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Monetti </PERSON>, a 20-year-old junior at <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> when he died. `` Frankly I had hoped the plane had a structural defect and fell apart and my son died because it was an unfortunate accident. We'd be devastated, but we'd pick up the pieces and we'd go on The more I hear the more it sounds like that if anything had gone right it would have been avoided.'' Many at the meeting questioned why some people avoided the bombing by canceling their reservations. <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLarracoechea </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, whose 39-year-old sister, <PERSON> Nieves </PERSON>, was a stewardess aboard the flight, said there were 169 empty seats on the plane and discount tickets for the flight had been sold. `` All the parties and all the people that are responsible for this lack of action should be brought to justice because on all their heads are the lives of 270 people,'' Ms. <PERSON> DeLarracoechea </PERSON> said. In recent weeks, relatives have urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommitte </ORGANIZATION> on Transportation to beef up security at airports, return property of victims of Flight 103 and reveal the status of security before the bombing. `` If we do not change this -LRB- terrorist -RRB- policy we will see these terrorist acts over and over again because the terrorists will not go away,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, whose 16-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Melina </PERSON>, died in the crash.

 A large tour operator closely linked with crippled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has been forced to file for bankruptcy protection, and a travel industry executive said rumors of other such failures abound. Tour operators are suffering as a result of fallout from the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> crisis that also has hit some commuter airlines. Precision Airlines of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, one of the commuter carriers that feeds into Eastern flights, recently suspended all operations and furloughed 350 workers, citing a 70 percent drop in passenger traffic. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union's strike against Miami-based Eastern, supported by most of its pilots and flight attendants, is now in its third week. Eastern filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law on March 9, and went shopping Sunday for the new pilots it needs to survive the draining strike. Last week <ORGANIZATION> Flyfaire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour operators specializing in <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> vacation packages, sought protection under Chapter 11 itself in a reflex action. `` Rumors have been flying'' of other tour operators also seeking refuge in bankruptcy protection, said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There's an obvious concern about anyone tied in with Eastern.'' Tour operators sell packages to travel agents. They function as wholesalers between airlines and hotels on one side and travel agents and consumers on the other. Flyfaire, based in <LOCATION> Hawthorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, used Eastern flights as the basis for around 70 percent of its tour packages. The tour operator, which says it is owed about $ 1.5 million by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, was squeezed by the airline's bankruptcy action. `` It became a nightmare,'' Flyfaire President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Garzilli </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, likening his company's plight to being on an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane that crashed. Flyfaire's financial losses are compounded by the fact that it can not operate normally without Eastern flying a full schedule, he said. The tour operator cut its staff from 230 to 50 after it filed for bankruptcy in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> court, <PERSON> Garzilli </PERSON> said. The 16-year-old company, with offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and other locations, had been pulling in about $ 110 million a year in sales. Now, <PERSON> Garzilli </PERSON>'s company must queue up with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s other unsecured creditors _ including banks, ticket holders, travel agents and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees demanding paychecks _ whose financial exposure is not backed by collateral. As the airline's bankruptcy proceedings drag on, it could be weeks or months before they are paid. It was not immediately known how many other tour operators are closely linked with Eastern the way Flyfaire is. Flyfaire's leading competitor in <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> tours, Liberty Travel, mainly uses other carriers. Ms. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said her group did n't know how many tied-in operators could be affected by the Eastern bankruptcy. Spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> were unavailable for comment Sunday.

<HEAD>Prototype Of Unique Aircraft Successful In First Test Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two test pilots took a successful 15-minute test flight Sunday in a prototype of a revolutionary aircraft designed to perform like both a helicopter and an airplane, officials said. The V-22 Osprey, the world's first production tilt-rotor aircraft, remained in helicopter mode throughout the flight, according to officials of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of two companies which built the craft. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials described tests in aircraft mode as `` a milestone soon to be accomplished.'' The V-22 Osprey performed both a slow taxi liftoff and a vertical takeoff during the landmark maneuvers and made conventional `` run-on'' landings, the officials said. Its top speed during the tests was limited to 20 knots, less than 25 mph. The aircraft combines the operational capabilities of a helicopter with those of a fixed-wind turboprop. With its engines and prop-rotors vertical, the V-22 takes off, hovers and lands like a helicopter. With its prop-rotors in forward position, the Osprey would become a fast, fuel-efficient, high-altitude turboprop airplane capable of reaching speeds of more than 345 mph. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Helicopters President <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesnut </PERSON> said the Osprey gives the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military `` the ability to develop new missions and tactics that can not be accomplished by any existing helicopter or airplane.'' Six flight-test prototypes are being built by <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Helicopters of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, under a $ 1.8 billion full-scale development contract issued by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Air Systems Command. The versatile Osprey is the first modern weapons system designed from conception to meet requirements of all four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed services, with deliveries expected to begin in 1992.

<TEXT>
 A British weekly reported Sunday that the man who made the bomb that blew up <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 and plotted the attack is a Libyan known to international security officials as `` The Professor'' because of his experience with explosives. The Sunday Express attributed its information to unidentified detectives. It did not identify the suspect by name. The Express also said a Lebanese student, 21-year-old <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaafar </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, unwittingly carried the bomb onto the flight in a radio-cassette player given to him as a gift, but it did not say who gave it to him. Investigators have said the bomb that blew up Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on Dec. 21, killing 270 people while flying from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was hidden in a radio-cassette player. Earlier news reports in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> have quoted unidentified sources as saying <PERSON> Jaafar </PERSON> may have carried the bomb aboard without knowing it when he boarded Flight 103 in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has questioned his father, <PERSON> Nazir </PERSON>, who has denied those reports. The flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, then changed planes in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for the flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Sunday Express said the `` Professor'' flew to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> on Dec. 13, eight days before the bombing. The report said the `` Professor'' trained as a member of an elite squad in the Libyan army in the 1960s. Besides being an expert in electronics and explosives, it said, he is a master forger and had military training in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that made him an expert in weaponry. It said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has confirmed the man was being hunted in connection with the bombing. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gladis </PERSON> on Sunday declined to comment specifically about the Express report but said of the Flight 103 bombing in general: `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is following this matter to ascertain the facts. We're not commenting on it other than that.'' The Sunday Express said the `` Professor'' trained recruits for two years at the Syrian headquarters of a Libya-backed group headed by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, who has been blamed for attacks on the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> airports in 1985 and other terrorist incidents. The `` Professor'' also visited <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and had trained <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, it said. The report said the `` Professor'' arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> using the name <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> and met an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> diplomat who let him work from the Iranian Embassy. It said he stayed in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> until Jan. 6 `` at least.'' He was seen three weeks ago driving a car with German license plates in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, the report said, and then he disappeared.

<TEXT>
 More than 40 angry friends and relatives of a slain 13-year-old girl stood Sunday outside the house where her body was found and taunted the family who lives there with chants of `` devils.'' The furious throng, which included the father, an aunt and an uncle of the slain girl, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinyes </PERSON>, shouted that the <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> family would `` rot in hell.'' The verbal assault lasted about two hours. The Golubs had returned to the house at 6:30 p.m. Saturday for the first time since the girl's death, when authorities ordered them to vacate the house because it was the scene of a crime. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s body was found March 4 in the basement of the <LOCATION> Golub </LOCATION> home in <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. She was seen entering the house a day earlier. <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Police Lt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Krausch </PERSON> said police were ready to make an arrest in the case, but that they deferred to the county prosecutor, who wanted first to present evidence to the grand jury on Wednesday. <PERSON> Krausch </PERSON> would not identify who was the target of the arrest. However, police have said that the only suspects in the case were two <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> brothers, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 14. At about noon Sunday, when <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> left the house on foot, he was followed by <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinyes </PERSON>, and the angry crowd. According to <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police spokesman Officer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Koller </PERSON>, a patroling police officer saw <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> being followed and called for assistance. When <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> reached a grocery store, about six blocks from his house, some of the mob repeatedly accused him of being a `` devil.'' Eight police cars arrived, and officers protected <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> as he left the store with his older sister, <PERSON> Adele </PERSON>, who had come to pick him up in a car. The verbal lynching continued, with one member of the crowd shouting at the sister, `` You are a devil for being with him.'' Ms. <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> yelled, `` My brothers were innocent,'' before breaking down into sobs and driving away in the car. At 12:20 p.m., as neighbors shouted that the house was filled with devils, several family members _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Adele </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> and their mother, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, left the house and drove away in one car. About 10 minutes later, their father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, left in a separate car as somebody shouted, `` You're raising devils in the house.'' As he drove away, the neighbors applauded. The Golubs departed `` for parts unknown,'' said <PERSON> Koller </PERSON>.

 `` The Last Emperor,'' which swept last year's Academy Awards, won this year's top British film award Sunday night, while two stars from `` A Fish Called <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>,'' won top acting awards The Danish movie `` <PERSON> Babette </PERSON>'s Feast'' won as best foreign language film and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Malle </PERSON> took top directing honors for `` Au <ORGANIZATION> Revoir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enfants </ORGANIZATION>.'' Both movies had also been nominated for best film of 1988. Sir <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON>, the 74-year-old veteran actor, received the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>' most prestigious award, becoming a fellow of the academy. It was presented by Oscar-winning director Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lean </PERSON> instead of fellow director Sir <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON>, who was hospitalized Sunday morning for suspected kidney stones. Guinness, who won an Oscar for `` The Bridge on the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kwai </LOCATION>'' in 1957, has been nominated for another Oscar this year for his supporting role in `` Little Dorrit.'' The Academy Awards will be presented in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> on March 29. Comedian <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON> was chosen best actor as the reserved English lawyer who lost his inhibitions to an American woman thief, played by <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, in `` A Fish Called <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON>, accepting the award from actor <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said in a closed-circuit TV relay he thought it should have gone to co-star <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, who was also nominated for his role as a manic jewel thief. <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> is nominated for an Oscar but <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON> is not. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Palin </PERSON>, the movie's stuttering animal lover who was forced to watch his goldfish swallowed and to accidentally cause the deaths of several dogs, got the best supporting actor award. `` It was a marvelous film to work on _ except if you're a fish or a dog,'' he joked in accepting the award. `` I want to thank <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON> who upgraded me from a pet salesman to a pet murderer and all the doggies who gave their lives.'' The <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Balcon </PERSON> award for outstanding British contribution to cinema went to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Crichton </PERSON>, director of `` A Fish Called Wanda'' and more than a score of other films. Two of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s leading ladies walked off with the best actress awards, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> for her starring role as a spinster piano teacher in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> in `` The Lonely Passion of <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearne </PERSON>'' and <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Judi </PERSON> <PERSON> Dench </PERSON> for her supporting role as the pushy mother in `` A Handful of Dust.'' Both are previous British award winners. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> skipped the ceremony because of a broken shoulder. <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>, accepting the best picture award for his epic film `` The Last Emperor'' about Chinese Emperor <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>, praised the important British contribution to the movie's technical and acting success, including actor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, who lost out in the best supporting actor competition. `` A World Apart'' won for best original screenplay, `` The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' for best adapted screenplay, `` Empire of the Sun'' for best score, and `` Defense Counsel <PERSON> Sedov </PERSON>,'' a Soviet movie about the righting of injustice, as best short film. The main Oscar nominees _ `` Rain Man,'' `` Dangerous Liaisons,'' `` Mississippi Burning,'' `` The Accidental Tourist'' and `` Working Girl'' _ were ineligible for the British awards because they were not released in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> during 1988. More than 2,300 people packed the grand ballroom at the Grosvenor House Hotel for the ceremony. Actors <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> and actresses <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Maclaine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hayley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> were among the celebrities who presented awards.

 An armed man killed his girlfriend and himself Sunday after an almost two-day siege in which he held the woman and her daughter and sister hostage, authorities said. The sister was shot in the head and was in critical condition after surgery, officials said. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> `` Dougie'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 20, had holed up with his hostages in their one-story home Friday night. The incident ended 42 hours later, at 5:40 p.m. Sunday, when police fired tear gas into the home and entered it. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, both 20, were dead of gunshot wounds when they arrived at St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s Hospital after the siege, said <LOCATION> Sangamon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> and hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Aggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> suffered a gunshot wound to the abdomen. His girlfriend was shot in the chest. Ms. <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>'s 14-year-old sister, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, was in surgery for her head wound, the coroner said. Earlier Sunday, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> released <PERSON> Katrina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, the 4-year-old daughter of his girlfriend, after police cut off electricity and gas to the house, according to police Cmdr. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Searcy </PERSON>. `` At about 6:15 a.m. the door opened and the little girl walked out,'' <PERSON> Searcy </PERSON> said. He said she `` was very tired and very hungry,'' but otherwise unharmed. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, reportedly armed with a handgun, had threatened to kill himself and the hostages throughout the confrontation. Neighbors screamed and ran from the site after police fired tear gas at the house, and television station <ORGANIZATION> WICS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> reported a fight broke out after bystanders learned of the deaths. One man at the scene, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, 47, was taken to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s with chest pains and was reported in fair condition Another hostage, the 2 -LCB- - month-old daughter of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and his girlfriend, was released at 8:30 a.m. Saturday Heavily armed police had surrounded the house, which <PERSON> Searcy </PERSON> said is the home of the <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> sisters and their mother. About 32 families were evacuated Saturday from neighboring houses, and were staying with relatives or being housed at <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> facilities Sunday. `` The neighborhood is shut down,'' <PERSON> Searcy </PERSON> said. Authorities periodically shouted through a bullhorn to keep <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> awake. `` We do n't want him resting or sleeping. We want him worn out just as we are _ so darn worn out and tired that he'll give up,'' <PERSON> Searcy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> made `` no demands whatsoever,'' <PERSON> Searcy </PERSON> said. He said he thought <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> went to the home because of a dispute with the girlfriend and refused to come out because `` he knows he's probably going to go to jail and he does n't want to go.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, a friend who talked to Thomas by telephone Saturday afternoon, described him as `` paranoid and insecure.'' `` He seems like he's almost hallucinating,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> was hospitalized recently for depression, and police believe he had been taking medication that might affect his moods. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> spent a year in prison for shooting two men at a dance in 1985. A judge reduced charges of attempted murder to two counts of aggravated battery, because a question existed about whether <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> intended to kill the men.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter carrying 37 Marines on maneuvers crashed in an isolated mountain region on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s southeast coast early Monday and 22 were killed, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said. Fifteen Marines were injured, some critically, when the Sikorsky Sea Stallion crashed shortly before 7 a.m. -LRB- 5 p.m. EST Sunday -RRB- in a rugged mountainous area south of the industrial port city of <LOCATION> Pohang </LOCATION>, 250 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The most seriously injured were evacuated to an amphibious assault ship off the Korean coast, the USS Belleau Wood, and the rest were flown to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. Officials said earlier that 34 people were aboard. No one on the ground was hurt, he said. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency, said in a report citing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> military officials that the helicopter exploded and burst into flames before slamming into the ground. The report said the explosion appeared to have been caused by an engine defect. It was the second fatal crash involving a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in four days. All four Marines were killed Friday when their CH-46 helicopter crashed in a rice paddy on the east coast. Marine officials said there was no explanation for either crash. Both helicopters were participating in the annual joint <LOCATION> U.S.-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> military `` Team Spirit'' maneuvers which includes 60,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military statement said the <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stallion </LOCATION>, a CH-53D troop transporter, was assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Futenma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. It carried a crew of four and 33 military passengers. Marine officials said they did not know if the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> unit aboard the helicopter was based in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Names of the injured and dead were withheld pending notification of next of kin. The cause of Monday's crash was not immediately known and authorities were still trying to determine if the helicopter crashed into a hillside or went down in midair, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials said. Investigators had been sent to the area to try and determine what happened, but no quick results were expected, they said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has some 43,000 troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty. About 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> are in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to take part in Team Spirit along with 30,000 of those based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the Anglican archbishop of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said Sunday his country's racial policies would change immediately if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations demanded it. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his active opposition to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s segregation policies known as apartheid, said his nation's racial policies are maintained because of `` immense economic interests'' by Western governments. `` If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Western countries wanted, apartheid would end tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` Some actions taken by the Western government have a background of racism,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> told reporters. `` They say that dollars are more important than people, especially when those people are black.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and six other Anglican officials arrived in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Saturday from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where they toured the country for five days. They leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Tuesday.

An agreement signed Feb. 14 by five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents sought to disband the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. The Contras have been supported by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government since 1981. The Anglican officials are visiting at the invitation of the Rev. Sturdie Downs, bishop of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, Anglican primate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said he accepted the invitation after hearing about `` the horrible pain and suffering of the people in these countries.''

 A sharp earthquake shook a large area of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> on Sunday, but no injuries or damage were reported. The tremor, which occurred at 4:07 p.m., was centered in southern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> just west of <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> about 170 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The quake was felt widely, all the way to <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> and to <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, including <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eagle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Medberry </PERSON> of the Tsunami Center here. Geological Survey earthquake monitors in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, recorded the quake at a preliminary magnitude of 5.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The Tsunami Center measured it at 5.6. An earthquake of 5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause considerable damage, while a 6 reading can cause severe damage. A 7 is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage. Authorities said there were no reports of injuries or damage in the sparsely populated area.

 A reporter and camera operator from an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> television station leave this week for six weeks in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Nothing unusual about that _ except that they'll be reporting for Soviet television. The trip is part of a unusual job-swapping deal in which a Soviet reporter will later spend six weeks at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> station <ORGANIZATION> WXIA-TV </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> WXIA </ORGANIZATION> Reporter <PERSON> Simeon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who is fluent in Russian, and cameraman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crabbe </PERSON> leave Tuesday for <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s sister city in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. There they will work for <ORGANIZATION> Gostelradio </ORGANIZATION>, the government organization that runs Soviet television. `` A lot of what we will be doing is comparative stuff between life in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and life in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. When they return, they'll be accompanied by <PERSON> Nugzar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhadze </PERSON>, an English-speaking Soviet reporter who will work at <ORGANIZATION> WXIA </ORGANIZATION> for six weeks, reporting to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> viewers. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickiewicz </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and one of the country's leading experts on Soviet television, said she believes it's the first such exchange of reporters. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he has been stockpiling features on life in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, with stories ranging from <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Megastore </ORGANIZATION> to AIDS victims, the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> pro basketball team, the homeless and an affluent teen-age girl `` who has a closet that's as big as most Russian apartments.'' He said most of his work in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> will be relatively apolitical, `` but if they have a hot story, like an earthquake, I'm part of the team. `` We told them, ` If you want to censor <PERSON> Simeon </PERSON>, go for it,''' said <ORGANIZATION> WXIA </ORGANIZATION> General Manager <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mars </PERSON>, who made two trips to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to set up the exchange. `` But just remember, when he comes back, he tells all.''

 A union umbrella group on Monday called for tougher safety standards for nuclear power plants worldwide and the creation of an `` independent'' international nuclear regulatory agency. The Brussels-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> said the Vienna-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> was `` unsuited'' for regulatory activities. In a 40-page report, the <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> said the agency was `` compromised by its role in promoting nuclear energy.'' The report released Monday called for creation of a watchdog group with powers to enforce binding safety standards and visit nuclear plants unannounced. It also called for unions to participate in setting and enforcing plant safety rules. The confederation is the non-communist world's largest union umbrella group and claims to represent 87 million workers from 141 unions in 97 countries. The organization said the report reflected a desire for greater openness in the nuclear power industry and called for regular statements on all nuclear incidents. `` This report is neither pro-nuclear nor anti-nuclear.

 It would be hard to tell from the amount of media coverage that the vehicle under government investigation for rollovers is the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bronco </ORGANIZATION> II and not the <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Samurai </PERSON>. It would also be hard to tell from the sales totals. Although the government has never had a harsh word about the Samurai, its sales are a tenth what they were before Consumer Reports magazine charged last year that the boxy little four-wheel-drive vehicle tips over too easily. The fate of the Samurai illustrates the power of the news media to influence car-buying decisions, particularly the power of the repeatedly televised videotapes showing the Samurai going up on two wheels in high-speed maneuvers. Now <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is waiting to see what will happen to sales of its <ORGANIZATION> Bronco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION> following the announcement last week that it will be investigated for rollovers by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Most auto analysts predict the government's probe _ strictly speaking, an engineering analysis _ will have little effect on Bronco II sales, for two reasons: _ Engineering analyses are routine Fifty-five were under way as of the end of February, the agency says. Of those, only some go on to the next stage, the `` case level.'' And only some of those result in determinations of safety defects. _ The Bronco II has not received as much negative publicity as the Samurai got, partly because the government did not release any gripping videotapes of the Bronco II going up on two wheels `` The power of the press really hit home in the Samurai controversy. So far the Bronco is pretty far from that type of situation,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlis </PERSON>, an auto analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The Jeep-like Samurai was rolling along at sales of about 6,000 a month when Consumer Reports magazine called a news conference on June 2 to say it was giving the vehicle a not-acceptable rating. It said the Japanese-built Samurai `` literally trips over its own feet'' because of a narrow tread width, short wheelbase, light weight and high center of gravity. Sales plunged to 2,199 in June. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> responded with dealer incentives that resulted in sharp price cuts, and sales rebounded to 6,327 in July and a record 12,208 in August. The automaker appeared to have come back from the brink. It got a boost on Sept. 1 when the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> denied a recall petition by the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based consumer group. The respite was short-lived, though, as sales plummeted to 560 in September, 787 in October and 483 in November. They jumped to 2,483 in December before retreating to 263 in January and 472 in February. Sales of the bigger, heavier and more expensive Bronco II run about 9,000 to 11,000 a month. Officials of <LOCATION> Brea </LOCATION>, Calif.-based American <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> say Samurai sales have been hampered by several unrelated factors, including the difficulties of introducing three other <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> models in the past several months: the Sidekick, the Swift GTi and the Swift GLX. But they admit that last summer's publicity hurt. Sales of all four <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> vehicles combined totaled less than 3,000 last month. `` We have seen a longer-term impact on the sales than we would have hoped. I'm not sure there is one reporter who can write a story about <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> without mentioning this issue,'' said <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doll </PERSON>, a spokeswoman with the company's public relations agency, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. The government safety board said it chose to investigate the Bronco II because statistics unearthed last year showed it had a far higher rate of fatal rollovers than the Samurai. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON>, head of the Center for Auto Safety, said he thinks the government missed some fatal rollovers involving the Samurai while slightly overstating the Bronco II's. He says the vehicles are equally bad. `` They both deserve to be investigated,'' he said in an interview last week. In fact, the government probe may not make much difference. Unless the agency discovers serious rollover problems with the Bronco II, its sales are likely to remain healthy. For the Samurai, meanwhile, the damage is already done.

<TEXT>
 A top Wall Street executive has begun a campaign for a measure he says would stimulate savings without aggravating the government's budget problems. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, contends that his idea would `` put some renewed sex appeal'' into individual retirement accounts. At the same time, he says, it would help to pay in advance for the future costs of health care and the well-being of the rapidly growing numbers of older Americans. <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON>'s idea, put forward in speeches he has been giving this month, is not to restore the tax breaks for <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> contributions that were curtailed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 _ not right away, at least. Rather, he is proposing that <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> savers be given the right to withdraw money from their accounts in the future for certain purposes _ medical, educational and home ownership _ without having to pay tax on the proceeds. <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON>'s argument starts from the premise that the nation needs to increase its chronically low savings rate if it is going to be able to bear the costs of supporting an aging population in the decades ahead. But he also acknowledges a more immediate need to settle current accounts that are out of whack. `` The deficit crisis is real,'' he says. `` We've got to find ways to encourage increased savings that take little or nothing out of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s hide now.'' Of course, <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON> is hardly a disinterested party in the debate over tax policy. When IRAs were opened up to all working Americans in 1982, they became lucrative products for firms like <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. In 1987, when deductions for contributions ended for married couples making $ 50,000 or more a year, and individuals with incomes of $ 35,000 and up, the flow of money into these accounts slowed significantly. But does his idea have merit? At first glance, at least, it looks like a tax break that would benefit upper-income people the most. Hence, it would n't seem to have much chance of attracting support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. However, supporters of the idea point out, the situation is n't quite that simple All <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> withdrawals, except for the amount of non-deductible contributions made by the well-to-do, are now subject to tax. So under <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON>'s proposal, all American workers would have a greater incentive to put as much money as possible in IRAs. The interest, dividends and capital gains that now build up tax-free inside IRAs would remain tax-free when they were taken out. What's more, the accounts could be used to plan not just for retirement, but for other goals <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON> describes as socially desirable, including education, and to help shoulder the burden of the mounting cost of health care. But the idea raises several tough questions. First of all, what would it mean for future government budgets? If taxpayers were able to build up large new amounts of money that the government could lay no claim to, might tax rates on other income have to be raised, and new types of taxes be created? Furthermore, would <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> contributors totally buy the idea that their money could actually never be taxed? Recent tax changes have tainted principles that once were thought to be sacrosanct: For example, `` no taxes on taxes.'' Well, state sales taxes no longer are deductible and the deduction for state income taxes barely survived the last debate about changing the rules. <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON>'s case is that the nation should be thinking long-term in handling its finances. As legions of financial advisers have pointed out in recent years, that is hard to do in a climate where the tax rules are subject to frequent and seemingly limitless change.

<TEXT>
 Students at two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> high schools, <PERSON> Gahr </PERSON> and nearby <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>, took a current events quiz last week, and the results could help decide whether commercial television gets a place in the classroom. The quizzes were part of a research effort designed to see if a daily TV news show that includes paid advertising is helping students learn. The nearly 2,000 students at <ORGANIZATION> Gahr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, have been able to watch the news show called Channel One for the past two weeks on 91 new television sets given to the school and installed in every classroom. The youngsters at <ORGANIZATION> Cerritos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, whose enrollment numbers and characteristics resemble those of its suburban <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> neighbor, have n't had a chance to see the news show but agreed to take the quiz anyway. <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based media concern that developed Channel One, plans to tally the results from these schools along with those from tests at the five other schools in the Channel One project and their sister schools and see if the show is helping educate students. Backers of the program are betting that the research will show a significant difference in the results from the schools that have been exposed to the show and those that have not. That could be a critical element in Whittle's efforts to persuade other schools to sign up for the Channel One project. Whittle hopes to expand the service to as many as 8,000 schools nationwide in the fall of 1990. `` We expect to see real differences, and if we do it will be a real plus for the program,'' Whittle chairman <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said Friday in a telelphone interview. The main obstacle to the project appears to be the intense opposition from children's advocates and some education groups who say companies should not be allowed to pitch their products to an essentially captive audience in school. Groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parent-Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> have opposed it. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Charren </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, a Massachusetts-based children's advocacy group, said she thinks the Channel One test has been orchestrated to gloss over the bad precedent she says is being set of allowing commercials in classrooms. `` The problem is we are selling children to advertisers ... They think they are going to get enough kids buying enough products to make the investment worthwhile,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Charren </PERSON> said. The test of Channel One began March 6 at <LOCATION> Gahr </LOCATION> and five others schools _ <ORGANIZATION> Mumford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Withrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Billerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>. Each school was given about $ 50,000 in televisions, video recorders and a satellite dish to recieve a daily 12-minute news show with up to two minutes of paid ads. The sponsors include <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s jeans, Snickers candy bars and Clearasil acne cream In return, the schools are asked to play the show once each school day. The test is to include five weeks of programs over a seven-week period. Channel One has just begun a two-week hiatus for spring break during which the producers hope to fine-tune the program. A typical news show relates the day's top stories and contains features on subjects like the environment and the lifetsyles of Soviet teen-agers. Last week, Channel One also carried a live 15-minute special without commercials on the launch of the space shuttle Discovery. To test if the show is effective, Whittle plans to give quizzes at all six schools and their sister schools in each district for comparison. Students at <LOCATION> Gahr </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION> got 29 multiple choice questions, most of which came from information in the past week's shows. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said his company is also conducting two other types of studies to measure the effectiveness of the project. He said one involves group interviews with teachers or students from the schools. The other involves telephone interviews with students who have gotten their parent's permission to talk about the commercials on the program. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said the comparative quiz results, the group discussions and the telephone polling will all figure in whether his company invests more than $ 100 million in hardware alone that he said will be required to go national. `` Five weeks is n't a very long time, but we ought to be able to show some movement,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 What started as a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef with growth-enhancing hormones is turning into an international scrap over the market for untreated meat. Twenty-eight countries have agreed to <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> requirements for certifying that beef sent to the 12-nation trading group is hormone-free, said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Vonthron </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s agricultural attache in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The largest exporters include <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. Which of those beef-producing countries will fill the $ 100 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the European market has yet to be determined. Retailers are now completing sales of their last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipments since the hormone-treated beef ban started, <PERSON> Vonthron </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> beef producers, who raise approximately one-fifth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef cattle, are concerned about whom European retailers might turn to while American suppliers are out of the market, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlcek </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. The Texans might be willing to accept the European standards to preserve their share of exports to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Vlcek </PERSON> said. Some <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> beef industry officials have already explored the idea. In addition, news about the U.S.-EEC dispute has incited a small but growing demand for hormone-free beef by health-conscious Americans, cattle producers and consumer groups said. At issue is the January ban by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef treated with three natural and two artificial growth hormones. The time-released, muscle-building substances are injected via pellet under the ear skin of a young cow or steer. Europeans contend that the hormones are a health hazard for humans. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the health issue is a pretext for a trade barrier. European cattle herds are too large for demand, according to <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, co-director of the Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suppliers have a similar problem. Americans are eating 23 percent less beef today than in 1976, he said. Concern over the purity of food and environment `` is a growing trend around the world in developed countries,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> Runge </PERSON>, who was special assistant to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> meeting of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade, which unsuccessfully sought to thwart the beef ban. Health and environmental concerns can be legitimate reasons to request trade restrictions, <PERSON> Runge </PERSON> said. But these fears also allow `` protectionists to hide.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has vowed to bar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef products for human consumption and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is retaliating with 100 percent tariffs on $ 100 million in European foods, ranging from canned tomatoes to instant coffee. Both sides agreed in February to establish a task force to study the issue. `` You've got a lobby in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that's very concerned'' about hormones accumulating in the beef organs imported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Runge </PERSON>. `` The European community has created a market niche that a number of -LRB- exporters -RRB- are trying to fill.'' One peculiarity of European beef imported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is that 75 percent consists of organ meat _ livers, kidneys, tongues and tripe used in everything from pate to steak and kidney pies. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> beef imports amount to only about 2 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production, according to <PERSON> Alisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> pointed out that this 2 percent accounts for much of the organ meat produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and cattlemen do n't want to change production methods for the several pounds of organ meat derived from each animal. `` We do n't feel it's right for a foreign government to dictate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> how we should produce our cattle,'' Ms. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said, noting that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> accepts hormone conditioning. The EEC is asking for certification of hormone-free beef which would boost the production cost of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat and make it less competitive, she said. `` The reason why we're so adament about opposing the the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is because they have n't been able to produce the scientific evidence to support their -LRB- hormone -RRB- ban,'' she said. The beef-hormone commotion also has piqued the curiosity of American consumers. `` People are worrying about food additives and it is growing daily,'' said <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, marketing director of <ORGANIZATION> Coleman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beef </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, which slaughters 20,000 cattle a year after certifying them additive-free. It is one of about six hormone-free beef producers that supply 1,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supermarkets catering to health-conscious buyers, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, director of the Americans for Safe Food Project, a consumer advocacy group. Beef free of both hormones and antibiotics, both used to enhance growth, sells for about 25 percent more than other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef, industry experts said. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said a 1988 study by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an independent, Washington-based trade association of 17,500 retail food stores, showed 61 percent of shoppers considered hormone and antibiotics in meat and poultry to be a serious health concern.

<HEAD>Futures Leaders Return Home With Congressional Warning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of the futures industry returned home from their annual convention in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with sunburns and a stinging admonition from some concerned congressmen to clean up their business. About two dozen federal lawmakers spoke during last week's four-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and their message to the approximately 1,000 brokers and exchange officials was clear: Put your house in order because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is coming through `` It is incumbent upon you to open your eyes to wrongdoing where it exists and be assertive and effective in rooting it out, even at the expense of making some internal fundamental changes; to try to do it yourself rather than waiting for someone else to do it to you,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., during a panel discussion on Saturday The futures industry is due for an official review as part of the congressional process for reauthorizing the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency that regulates futures trading. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s current 3-year authorization expires on Sept. 30. The recent disclosure of a sweeping <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation of suspected trading fraud at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s two world-leading futures exchanges has heightened public interest in the industry and brought demands for intense scrutiny and reform of these once-obscure markets. `` Out there in the country, our constituents do n't know a lot about futures trading; none of them have ever heard of the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>. It is important as we look at this industry that they know the importance of it,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, who sits on a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agriculture subcommittee that is conducting one of several congressional reviews of the industry. A future is a binding contract to buy or sell a bundle of commodities or financial instruments at a specified price at a future date. Agricultural commodity futures have been traded at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest futures exchange, for more than 140 years. But most of the action now is in financial futures, which were invented in the 1970s and are heavily used by institutional investors around the world to reduce their risks in the international stock, bond and currency markets. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s probe of suspected cheating by traders at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has yielded no charges since it was revealed on Jan. 19. Nevertheless, some key lawmakers who attended last week's industry meeting in <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, indicated support for: _ Beefing up <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s trade-surveillance and rule-enforcement _ Tightening up record-keeping by futures exchanges and brokerage firms _ Cracking down on certain trading practices that some believe provide opportunities to cheat If the futures industry can not satisfactorily police itself, several lawmakers implied, it will lose its cherished freedom to set and enforce most of its own rules. `` Our committee is not going to resolve in favor of self-regulation unless there is a perception that it seems to be working universally,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which also oversees futures regulation. Over and over during the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> meeting, exchange officials vowed to improve their auditing of trades and to root out and punish wrongdoers. `` Certainly we can do better than we have done,'' <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee, told <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> on Saturday. `` I give you the entire promise of my whole being that we will respond in every possible way that we can to your message.'' Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, suggested that futures leaders view the various investigations of their industry as an `` opportunity to recapture the one commodity you can never afford to lose: the universal recognition of the integrity of your markets.''

<HEAD>Study: Boston Tenants Paying Highest Percentage of Income on Rent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Boston-area tenants pay a bigger chunk of their income in rent than tenants in any other major city in the country, while <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> residents pay the smallest, a new study says. A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> research firm, <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advice </ORGANIZATION>, calculated that <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s median rent is $ 586 a month. That is about the same as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, but the study found median incomes were lower in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, so that while <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscans </LOCATION> pay 19.5 percent of their income on rent, Bostonians pay 21.3 percent. Renters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> pay a median of $ 444 per month. Though the rent is lower than <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s, it amounts to about the same percentage of income as renters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> pay, again because <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> incomes are lower, the study found. The figures are lower than actual market-rate rents because they include subsidized apartments. Excluding subsidized apartments, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redevelopment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> figures the average rent in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> last year was $ 800 a month. <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> was ranked as the most economical of the 25 cities surveyed in terms of percentage of income, with a monthly rent of $ 346 _ about 13 percent of the median household income. It was followed by <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, where the median rent is $ 322, or 13.5 percent of household income. Next to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the least economical city was <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where median rents were $ 521, or 20.7 percent of income. The average of all 25 cities was $ 425 _ 18.5 percent of monthly income. Median rents for other cities, along with the percentage that it comprised of median income, included <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, $ 380 and 13.8 percent; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, $ 441 and 15.1 percent; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, $ 419 and 15.3 percent; and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, $ 601 and 18.3 percent. The study touched a nerve in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where rents have increased 64 percent since 1982. That includes a 6.1 percent rise last year that was the biggest of any major metropolitan area except <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. Rents are skyrocketing in a city that already has one of the highest median house prices in the nation, estimated as high as $ 195,000. `` The simple fact is that people ca n't afford to buy homes,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Finfer </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affordable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. `` So the average blue-collar, lower-middle-class person is staying in rentals longer, making more competition for rental units. There's not enough production of affordable housing.'' `` We've looked at some of the rent indexes, and the Northeast in general and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in particular have had above-average rent increases over the past six to eight years,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Apgar </PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Economists say the middle class is caught in a dilemma of not being able to save for a down payment because of high rents, but making too much money to qualify for subsidized rentals. Would-be homebuyers <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobey </PERSON> have been saving for a down payment for more than three years and expect it will take at least two more. `` House prices have risen so fast that it's terribly hard for first-time home buyers,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Robey </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Rental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said there is virtually no construction of rental apartments in the range just below <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s median level He said city leaders must try to work with community leaders in encouraging construction of affordable housing. `` Everyone's for affordable housing as long as it's not in their back yard,'' he said. `` There's a lot of lip service, but not a lot of action.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against High Voltage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> welcomed Sunday a federal court ruling that upheld his company's defenses against a hostile $ 643 million takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voltage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We are pleased with the court's decision,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the Milwaukee-based supplier of food and food ingredients. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadtmueller </PERSON> issued his ruling Saturday, denying a motion by a High Voltage that sought to invalidate <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover law. The judge also denied a motion for a preliminary injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION>'s `` poison pill'' defense against takeovers. That defense would allow Universal shareholders to buy additional shares of the company at half price if High Voltage were to pursue its bid. High Voltage said it had no immediate comment on the ruling. <PERSON> Stadtmueller </PERSON> rejected an argument that Universal's directors violated their duty to shareholders by opposing the takeover and threatening use of the poison pill. `` I find no evidence in the record which convinces me that the board failed to review this offer in a dispassionate and neutral manner,'' the judge wrote. High Voltage has offered $ 35 a share for Universal stock, which closed Friday at $ 33 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. Universal executives contend a takeover would damage the company's long-term growth, including its ability to invest in research and development of new products. Universal, based in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, is a worldwide supplier of food and food ingredients, including yeast, cheese, frozen potatoes and food colorings. It employs about 4,600 people.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar firmed in early trading against the Japanese yen Monday while stock prices fell. The dollar opened trading at 131.88 yen, up 0.81 yen from Friday's close. A dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said the dollar remained firm in early trading following a strong showing on overseas markets last Friday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the currency closed last week at 131.68 yen following a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government report Friday that the nation's producer price index rose a full percentage point in February, triggering a new wave of inflation and interest-rate worries. There was concern over higher short-term interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the dealer who spoke anonymously. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 77.01-point loser last Friday, shed 315.24 points or 0.9 percent, shortly after the market opened to move to 31,705.77.
