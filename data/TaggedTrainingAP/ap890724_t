 <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> lied when they said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> authorized them to take ministry money they used to buy property and jewelry, a prosecutor said Monday before deliberations began in the Taggarts' tax evasion trial. The jury started deliberations just after 5 p.m. on the 12th day of the trial. Jurors left after three hours and were to resume Tuesday. `` In a nutshell, this case is about power,'' prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in his closing statement in the brothers' trial. `` The power <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> and his brother exercised at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> to line their own pockets.'' The Taggarts are charged with evading $ 525,000 in income taxes after spending nearly $ 1.2 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money on personal luxuries such as condominums, jewelry, expensive cars and designer clothes. The trial began July 5. If convicted, each brother could be sentenced to 25 years in prison and face fines of more than $ 1 million. The defense rested Thursday following two days of testimony from the Taggarts, who began at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> as piano players. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> gave no reasons for then postponing Friday's session Within a few years of joining <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1970s, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, 32, was <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s top personal aide. <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 35, was the interior designer at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> retreat just south of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. Before his closing remarks, defense attorney <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> placed items from such exclusive <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stores as <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> on a bench in front of the jury. `` If what is on trial here is a lifestyle you do n't like, then we did n't need a trial at all,'' he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told the jury that the government's case was made more difficult by some of the witnesses _ including the two defendants. `` If you're not offended by the evidence of how they spent the money they took from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ... you should be offended by the fact that both defendants got on the stand and lied,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. He said there was ample evidence to support the government's case <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> showed `` audacity and greed'' when he testified he was entitled to be paid at a level similar to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> never authorized it, never, not once. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> took the stand and lied to you and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> conspired to take money from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> and not pay taxes on it,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. He referred to <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>'s testimony that he had authority from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to take large cash advances and use PTL blank checks. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> testified last week that his way of accounting for the $ 1.2 million was to submit documentation to justify it, receive a tax form from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> that called the cash advances income or that the cash advances would be considered a loan which would be converted into a bonus. <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> used his closing arguments to return to testimony about a verbal agreement he said was reached between <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> in 1983. He asked the jurors not to dismiss the agreement simply because it was an oral contract. <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> agreed to give <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> access to the same resources he enjoyed. `` The intent was not to beat the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> out of money. It was to have <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> shoulder the burden,'' <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> said.'

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> appointed new foreign and defense secretaries Monday, fired two Cabinet ministers and switched around others in the biggest government shake-up since she won power 10 years ago. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> named <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON>, one of the least-known members of her 22-member Cabinet, as the new foreign secretary, making him a prime contender to succeed her. He replaces Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, who was moved to a vacant post as deputy prime minister. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> will also lead the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. The prime minister, battling to halt her government's slide in popularity, also put new appointees in an array of major posts including the portfolios for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the environment. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> fired her harassed <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>, who had been accused of bungling bomb warnings before <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 was blown up over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on Dec. 21, and Social Security Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. The two other Cabinet ministers to depart _ <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> and Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young _ said they were resigning to resume business careers. Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> was named defense secretary in an apparent reward after four years as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top official in the embattled province. The appointment of Major as foreign secretary was a big step up from his former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post as chief secretary to the treasury, the No. 2 financial official. The 46-year-old son of a circus trapeze artist was raised in poverty in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s rundown <LOCATION> Brixton </LOCATION> district, never went to university and worked as a building laborer before making a career in banking. He entered Parliament in the May 1979 general election that brought Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to power and ousted a socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government. His appointment underlined the transformation of the hierarchy of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, once the preserve of the British upper classes, since Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, a grocer's daughter, took over. `` We now know, without the need for guesswork, who her chosen successor will be,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s liberal Guardian newspaper commented Tuesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, 63, is widely expected to retire some time after bidding for an unprecedented fourth successive term at the next election. It must be held by mid-1992. The move of <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, 62, to deputy prime minister was widely regarded as a demotion from one of the most prestigious jobs in the Cabinet. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also brought into the Cabinet another member of the class of 1979, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON>, a rising star from the party's liberal wing, as the new environment secretary. Reflecting anxiety at the government's drop in the polls and its drubbing in elections for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last month, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> shifted Education Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Party chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> was named <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Secretary, a tough job that effectively removes the incumbent from day-to-day contact with party political issues in mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Energy Secretary <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> favorite whose political career was interrupted after a scandal over an extramarital liaison six years ago, was named transport secretary. He resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 after news broke that his ex-secretary, with whom he had an affair, was carrying his child. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> brought him back into the Cabinet when she won a third term in May 1987. The shake-up, announced after Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> summoned government ministers to her Downing Street office for private meetings, appeared aimed primarily at freshening the government's image. Beset by rising inflation, a revival of labor union militancy and facing a much tougher challenge from the revived <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has trailed <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> seven to 15 points in polls since the spring. <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, a chain-smoking scion of an aristocratic family, who was named trade and industry secretary. <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, accused by critics of mishandling the current passage through Parliament of a controversial new tax, is deeply unpopular with many party members, who blame him for worsening the government's poll standing. But Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who has the sole power to appoint <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers, has repeatedly defended him. The dismissal of <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>, an heir to the Guinness brewing fortune and reputedly the richest member of the Cabinet, had been predicted. In the aftermath of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> disaster, his department was accused of being tardy about passing on detailed bomb warnings to airlines. Critics also said he mishandled current strikes by employees of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground. Other new Cabinet appointments announced were <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamont </PERSON> as treasury secretary and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gummer </PERSON> as Agriculture Minister. Both previously held government jobs outside the Cabinet. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakeham </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in the Commons, became the new energy secretary, and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, former trade minister, the new social security secretary.

 The man accused of killing actress <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> reportedly traveled to the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> hometown of <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the young girl whose 1983 visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> drew international attention Police investigators were told that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON>, now 19, ran away and traveled to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> four or five years ago to be near the <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> girl, the <ORGANIZATION> Tucson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. In July 1983, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, then 11, went to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for a two-week tour at the invitation of the late Soviet leader <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>. She had written a letter to <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>, asking the world leader whether he favored war. In an unusual move, he responded to her letter, telling her the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people had peaceful intentions and inviting her to visit his country. Two years later, on Aug. 25, 1985, she and her father were killed in a plane crash near <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> homicide detective, said he heard the <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> story from an acquaintance of <LOCATION> Bardo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> would not identify the acquaintance. Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Armijo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, told <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> police detectives after his son's arrest that the son had developed the obsession for <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and had run away to find her. <PERSON> Armijo </PERSON> said detectives were told <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> had gotten within several blocks of the <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> home but was picked up by police when he asked for directions. <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> was returned to his parents. <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> last Wednesday, one day after Ms. <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> was gunned down at her apartment building in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He is jailed in lieu of $ 1 million bail, and his lawyer has said <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> will fight extradition to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Neither <PERSON> Armijo </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> indicated they thought <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> was thinking of harming the young girl. <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON>, declined to comment on the Smith matter. `` We're not discussing anything with anyone,'' the elder <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> said. `` Later on we'll release a statement, but we're kind of sorting it out ourselves right now.''

 Police issued a murder warrant Monday for a 44-year-old drifter accused of killing two people aboard a county bus and wounding another motorist while stealing his car. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Besaraba </PERSON> was charged with two counts of murder, one count of armed robbery, one count of attempted murder, said <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Det </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Darron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cansiglione </PERSON>. Police circulated a photo of <PERSON> Besaraba </PERSON> among homeless men at the food program of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. The man reportedly used the program as an address. `` The police contacted us early yesterday because they said they had this address,'' First Lutheran Pastor <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. Late Monday, police announced they had signed a warrant for <PERSON> Besaraba </PERSON>, known by the nickname `` Crazy Joe'' to other homeless men at the shelter. `` He was wild and spontaneous,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who knew <PERSON> Besaraba </PERSON> from the shelter. Witnesses said the gunman had been drinking wine at the stop in front of a supermarket in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, a suburb north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He stepped into the door of the bus after it pulled up and opened fire at the driver and sprayed bullets through bus windows. `` The door opened. He stood up, reached under his shirt and pulled out a gun,'' said <PERSON> Devin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppy </PERSON>, 28, a passenger in the rear of the bus. `` The driver looked at him and he shot him three times in the head. He did n't say a word. People were screaming and jumping on the floor. I kept saying, ` Get down!''' <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Granger </PERSON>, 43, a driver for the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, was killed. An immigrant from <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> with several children, he was making his last round and had about 30 minutes left on his shift. The passenger on the bus had been identified but his name was not released by midday Monday until next of kin could be told. No special safety procedures were planned after the shooting, because it appeared to be a random incident, `` nothing that could be deemed a vendetta against bus drivers,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Volinski </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION>. He said two bus drivers who knew the victim stayed out of work Monday, but most drivers had shown `` a surprisingly stable reaction.'' `` We've tried to have our own supervisors and superintendents keep a greater visibility and availability to the operators,'' he said. `` They might be at transfer locations or in their car where certain buses are scheduled to stop.'' After the initial shootings, the gunman walked through the supermarket parking lot to an intersection and banged his gun on the window of a car, witnesses said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaguda </PERSON>, 31, a tourist from <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, surrendered his car and was walking away when the gunman shot him three times in the lower left leg and twice in the back, witnesses said. `` The -LRB- gunman -RRB- seemed like he did n't have a care in the world,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 40, who ran to call police. `` He just lifted his arm and bang, bang, bang.'' She said <PERSON> Yaguda </PERSON> `` was backing away. He had no reason to shoot him.'' <PERSON> Yaguda </PERSON> was in Memorial Hospital in critical but stable condition Monday, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> reached agreement with its creditor banks late Sunday on a package that is expected to make significant reductions in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign debt burden, the second largest in the developing world. The agreement, which provides banks with three options to chose from in providing assistance to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, marks the first breakthrough for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's Third World debt strategy. Officials involved in the talks estimated that the package had the potential of reducing by up to one-third the $ 4.5 billion in payments <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> must make annually to service the $ 54 billion it owes to commercial banks. However, the exact benefits of the plan will not be known for many months until the individual banks holding the loans make decisions regarding the extent to which they will participate in the debt reduction package arrived at Sunday. Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> hailed the accord in a nationwide television and radio address in that country. He said it answered `` the cry of Mexicans to return to growth'' and `` opened a breach'' for other countries with similar debt problems. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> described the negotiations as `` difficult, complex and tense.'' The successful conclusion of the negotiations came after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> joined in the final stages of the marathon discussions. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, emerging after the talks ended late Sunday, said, `` You see a lot of smiles around here,'' but he refused to discuss specifics of the final agreement. However, another official, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, said the final package offers banks two ways to provide debt relief to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. They can agree to reduce the principal on the old loans by 35 percent or they can agree to reduce the interest being charged on the loans to 6.25 percent. A third option commercial banks will have is providing new loans to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Those banks willing to reduce principal or cut the interest charged will be able to get guarantees on the remaining debt from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the two multinational lending agencies that are backing the administration's debt strategy. In a statement, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> agreement `` a major step forward in the implemenation'' of the administration's debt reduction initiative. `` The agreement between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and its creditor banks will provide significant debt and debt-service reduction for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, as well as new money, to support <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economic growth,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, working with other countries, was willing to offer <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> short-term financing of up to $ 2 billion until <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> began receiving the new money agreed to in the plan. The negotiating teams for the final agreement were led by <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> and the head of the committee representing commerical banks in the talks. Both men were smiling when they emerged from the talks, held in <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s office and various conference rooms on the third floor of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. The official Mexican new agency, <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION>, said there were last-minute negotiations over a `` readjustment clause'' that would increase debt payments once the Mexican economy got moving again. But the official who discussed the talks said that both sides had agreed to tie increased debt payments to any improvements in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s export sales after the year 1996. The so-called `` readjustment clause'' has reportedly been a sticking point in the talks, with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> maintaining that raising debt payments at a later date might block an economic recovery that the cuts are designed to foster. The fact that <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> were both participating in the talks was an indication of the high priority the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has placed on completing a deal with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the country which is considered the test case for the administration's new initiative to reduce debt. Last March, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> unveiled the strategy which sought to reduce a portion of the $ 1.3 trillion debt burden being carried by Third World nations by offering various inducements to persuade commercial banks to forgive a portion of their loans. The administration had hoped to have a finished Mexican debt package to present during the seven-nation economic summit held week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. To help move the talks along, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a hurriedly scheduled meeting with Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. While the talks between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and its creditor banks failed to arrive at a breakthrough before the summit ended, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was successful in winning backing for the strategy in the final economic communique. The administration also announced in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was prepared to put up between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion as an emergency `` bridge'' loan to supply money until funds start arriving from the commercial banks. `` With this accord we have achieved our goal of reducing from 6 to 2 percent -LRB- of the gross national product -RRB- our net transfers abroad,'' an anonymous source close to the talks said, according to <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 54 billion owed to private banks represents about half of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s $ 107 billion foreign debt, the second largest in the developing world after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s. Reducing the crushing debt is the centerpiece of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s policy. It is seen in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> as the key to getting the nation's stagnant economy moving again. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt crisis began with a borrowing spree during the oil boom years of the late 1970s. When the bottom fell out of the oil market in 1982, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> economy went into a tailspin that has seen the average worker's buying power fall by half. The economic crisis sparked fears of political instability as unhappy Mexicans began turning against the party that has ruled for 60 uninterrupted years. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, a Harvard-educated economist, was held to the smallest margin of victory in party history in last year's presidential elections.

<TEXT>
 In a continent littered with economic disasters, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> heads toward independence as a potential success if it can meet the demands of poor blacks without alienating wealthy whites and foreign investors. The desert territory has profitable mining, fishing and farming industries and one of the best infrastructures in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, much of it built with money from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. White-controlled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has administered <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, for 74 years under a mandate from the defunct League of Nations. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s per capita income of about $ 1,000 annually is among the highest in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But economists say its independence could bring a sharp economic decline and they list these reasons: _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has provided up to 25 percent of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s $ 750 million annual budget, is expected to cut virtually all aid after independence, expected early next year _ Thousands of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s whites, concerned about the future under a black-led government, are expected to leave the country or move their assets to neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. _ Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla group expected to win pre-independence elections in November, have virtually no hands-on economic experience. They proclaim socialist policies associated with crumbling economies elsewhere in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` SWAPO does not conceal its belief in the moral superiority of socialism over capitalism,'' the organization said in an election manifesto. `` The state will have ownership of a significant part of the country's economic resources,'' it said. `` Egalitarianism forms the basis of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- vision of a just social order.'' Such promises are popular among the black majority in a territory where the unemployment rate is estimated at 25 percent and few blacks own homes or businesses. Will it work? All the southern African nations that have relied heavily on state control of the economy _ <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> _ have suffered economic declines or fallen short of their potential. <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, the one black-ruled country in the region to pursue a market-oriented economy, has prospered. `` <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has raised expectations that will be difficult to meet regardless of their policies,'' said <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, a private economist in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>. The organization has promised major improvements in education, health care, housing and jobs. But <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has not said how it will finance the programs. The territory now has a budget deficit of about $ 180 million and a foreign debt of more than $ 300 million. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> will have to try to prevent a recession in the northern towns and villages of the <LOCATION> Ovambo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> tribe </LOCATION>, where the organization draws its strongest support. An estimated 50,000 South African soldiers have left <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since the year-long independence plan took effect April 1. Most were stationed in the north, where Namibians fought them but relied on their money. Hundreds of small general stores, known as cuca shops, are central to economic life in the north and are likely to suffer. Thousands of Namibians employed by the military in jobs ranging from soldiers to maids are now out of work. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has softened its hard-line socialist language in recent months in an effort to encourage whites to stay and to attract foreign investors. `` We will invite foreign investors to develop our economy,'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said recently in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` We do not think the present moment is the time for nationalizations.'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> also has made it clear it will accept a mixed economy and needs the skills and capital of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s 75,000 whites, who make up 6 percent of the territory's 1.3 million people. Whites own an estimated 65 percent of private property in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and earn at least 10 times more than blacks on average, according to <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s main opponent, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, says <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s moderate tone will vanish if the organization comes to power. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> remains committed to `` an outdated and demonstrably unsuccessful ideology _ that of doctrinaire socialism _ an ideology that has already destroyed the economies of most African states,'' said the alliance, a multiracial coalition that favors a market-oriented economy. The Namibian government, under South African control, already accounts for more than half the territory's $ 1.3 billion gross domestic product. Large diamond and uranium mining companies, owned by firms in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, make up the largest chunk of the private sector. Consolidated Diamond Mining of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, owned by <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Beers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, recently said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s economic views contain `` some inaccuracies and a certain lack of realism.'' But the company also said it was `` encouraged by -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- apparent willingness to negotiate'' and that willingness `` offers scope for reconciliation between government and the private sector.''

 Stuck in traffic? Tired of waiting for the bus? Fed up with rising air fares? Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> is trying to find out what Americans want to do about it. But <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, in starting today a series of nationwide public hearings aimed at coming up with a national transportation policy, is asking for ideas, not complaints. `` You should n't go if you're just going to say, ` We've got gridlock, somebody ought to do something about it,' because we know that,'' said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> in an interview. `` These are needs and idea sessions.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who carries a regular <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Metrorail card in his wallet and drives to work on the same jammed roads as this region's other commuters, said the nation has been taking transportation for granted And he makes it clear this includes the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> is a former federal prosecutor and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area transit chief brought to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We've had a policy, but there has n't been a coordinated national policy,'' he said. `` There was an absence of planning, and I happen to be a planner.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the nation's airports, highways, bridges, waterways and mass transit system are simply wearing out. `` We're going to have to rebuild it and replace it, or we're not going to be able to rely on it anymore,'' he said. Among the most critical problems are a lack of planning for new airports, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, and $ 80 billion worth of work on the country's deteriorating bridges. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled 33 meetings in cities ranging from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Meetings are to be moderated by department experts in various fields, with sessions focusing on different subjects according to the location. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday, for example, it's rural needs, including health care delivery, intercity buses and rail transport. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Sept. 8, it will be drug and alcohol use in the commercial transportation system and federal research and development. The last meetings will be Sept. 11-12 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> has asked for expert testimony at the hearings as well as comments from anyone interested in improving any aspect of highway, rail, air, or water transportation. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> has some of the most wide-ranging responsibilities in the administration. He is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s point man in the Alaskan oil spill because his department oversees both the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and pipelines. He's also issued key decisions affecting issues ranging from automobile mileage standards to air terrorism. The department is accepting written suggestions until Sept. 1. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he hopes to have a new set of transportation policies in place before the end of his first year in the Cabinet. What will it all amount to when the policy is set? <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> sees ambitious results affecting every American: `` Maybe it will eliminate gridlock. Maybe it will make it easier for you to get to work. Maybe it will hold down air fares. Maybe it will make you more productive in your job by making it easier to get to various places in the country.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, rebounding from negative reviews early in his presidency, is now winning good marks after two successful trips to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a general sense of economic well-being at home. The president is `` a late bloomer,'' says one analyst. At the 100-day point, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was criticized as being too cautious, unimaginative and unwilling to compete with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. After six months in office, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> basks in praise for winning support at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan to reduce conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and for traveling to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to encourage democratic reforms. `` He's actually done well after a halting beginning,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, a presidential scholar at <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` aided enormously by the fact that the Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were in disarray'' as House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> struggled with ethical problems and then resigned. `` There was no challenge to his leadership.'' After losing a battle with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for confirmation of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came back with a decisive victory on his veto of a $ 1.20 increase in the minimum wage. `` He's obviously in a lot better shape than he was at 100 days,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a presidential scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's had two awfully good trips abroad and when a president travels abroad, he gets an awful lot of attention.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> political scientist who called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a late bloomer, said, `` It's as though there's a second honeymoon at the six-month point. `` It's tied to real successes, particularly in the foreign sphere, and things are going reasonably well abroad and at home,'' <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> said. `` The economy may be slow but it's not in recession. There's no war or threat of it, and things appear to be going in our direction.'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, a political analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s foreign travels `` tilt the balance away from the notion that the guy who was making things happen was <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asleep at the switch. `` It erases the notion of a passive president who's doing nothing,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, said, `` It's nice to see the beginning of a response that everybody hoped there would be.'' Polls show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a positive rating of 66 to 73 percent, which puts him ahead of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at this point in his presidency. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s approval rating was slipping in April and May but then began to turn around `` Between May and July, he's been dealing with international problems and the country tends to rally around a president who's dealing with rather clear-cut international issues,'' said <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON> On the other hand, <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` still an enigmatic character to many people. That's where he's weak.'' He said the category of people classified as `` do n't know'' or `` no opinion'' about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is higher than with other presidents, running at about 26 percent. Countering that criticism, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said `` vision does n't fit on a bumper sticker.'' He said the president is defining his agenda with specific proposals to balance the budget, bail out the savings and loan industry, clean up air pollution and combat crime. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has demonstrated `` a willingness to do his homework, to spend the time examining the details, then to make a decision not in haste.'' Asked what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should have done differently, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> replied, `` Honest, in terms of the big issues and timetable and the agenda and the approach, not a heck of a lot.'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should be more aggressive, establish a long-term agenda and take some risks. Beyond that, he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was losing `` an awful lot of direction and momentum'' by the fact that hundreds of top-level appointments have not been made. `` He could plummet the next six months if we slipped into a recession,'' cautioned <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>. `` There's a little too much basking in the glow of a 70 percent approval rating, not capitalizing on it,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. `` If you're up around 70 percent early on, it's a good time to let it drop down to 60 percent by pushing some things through that may be a little controversial.'' There is widespread agreement that much of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s popularity is due to his personal style, his high energy level and obvious relish for the job. `` I think we've grown used to him, like an old, comfortable shoe,'' said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. `` Some of the rough edges from the campaign have rubbed off. He has n't forced himself on us.'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is not the kind of guy who's going to fall asleep with the pope'' _ alluding to an occasion where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nodded off while meeting with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said, `` I think people right off the bat perceived a different style'' from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> days. `` They have really begun to feel comfortable and appreciative of the style. I think that is very important for a president to do _ to give his mark to the office that he probably will be occupying for eight years.''

 Holy Batroots! Is it really true, as some scientists suggest, that human beings and bats might be distant cousins who share the same primeval ancestors? Is there a Batman or Count Dracula lurking in each of us? In the heat of this summer's batmania, with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> moviegoers breaking box-office records to see `` Batman,'' anything seems possible. The National Zoo's bat expert, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidensticker </PERSON>, says it's an intriguing theory, one you could sink your teeth into, but he's not sure he believes Other scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> scoff at the idea. <PERSON> Seidensticker </PERSON> says brain studies have yielded evidence that certain kinds of large bats found in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> may be descendants of prehistoric primates akin to lemurs or mouselike shrews. `` The theory is that these bats are really flying primates,'' he says, and connected somehow in the evolutionary chain to the early primate ancestors of monkeys, apes, gorillas _ and humans. But Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Handley </PERSON>, a leading authority on bats and other mammals at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION>, says this theory is a `` hot potato'' of scientific controversy that has won few adherents. `` We do n't know what the ancestors of bats really were,'' <PERSON> Handley </PERSON> said. The 160 fluttering bats in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>'s new Bat Cave are n't talking. In fact, they do n't display the slightest familial interest in their supposed two-legged cousins who stare intently through a glass wall into their dimly lighted hideaway of damp rocks and hollow tree trunks. One recent visitor was Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his children, who attended the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> premiere of `` Batman'' at a nearby movie theater and then joined a post-screening party for 1,200 guests in a tent outside the Bat Cave. <PERSON> Seidensticker </PERSON>, the zoo's associate curator of mammals, illuminated the cave for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> with a flashlight. He said the vice president was `` very interested'' in the bats and lingered for seven minutes, much longer than the average tourist. <PERSON> Seidensticker </PERSON> said bats `` are not mice with wings, they are bats,'' and people should n't be afraid of them. `` They actually are nice, fun, incredible animals,'' he says. `` They're great little guys.'' Keeper <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Prima </PERSON>, who wears a Batman baseball cap, says the bats have never bothered her. `` They're not aggressive,'' she said. `` If anything, they're just curious.'' They hover watchfully while she scrubs the cave walls or delivers their meals. The bats, three species of fruit eaters, consume 30 pounds of grapes, melons, bananas and a gruel of peach nectar and vitamins every day. The rest of the time they fly back and forth, socialize in their `` harems'' and just hang out. Or, more precisely, hang down. They also have active sex lives. `` They're continuously producing babies,'' <PERSON> Seidensticker </PERSON> says. Ms. <PERSON> Prima </PERSON> says she's never felt threatened working in the Bat Cave. `` They never touch me, and they've never flown into my hair,'' she said. `` They keep their distance. They know you're there, but they are n't interested in coming near you. They are n't accepting you as a bat.'' `` There's no need to fear these little guys,'' she says, although some visitors have been seen anxiously sprinting past the Bat Cave without a glance. The public's most frequently asked question, says <PERSON> Seidensticker </PERSON>, is `` Where's the Batmobile?''

 Action on Capitol Hill reaches a frenzied level this week as lawmakers seek to pass a flurry of money bills, grapple with how much to spend on the stealth bomber and clear other legislative tangles before going on summer vacation. Leading the agenda in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is legislation laying out <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending priorities for the coming year. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be lobbying House members against an effort to either freeze production of the B-2 bomber, known as the stealth because of its radar-eluding capabilities, or cut the number to be built from eight per year to two. Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee is pushing ahead with its investigation of the scandal at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. The House Government Operations housing subcommittee summoned <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a former career <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employee, to testify today about dealings with her friend, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, a former top <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official. The administration contends that the stealth bomber, built to penetrate Soviet airspace, is a key to future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear deterrence. But members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wrestling with serious deficit problems are shocked at its cost _ more than half a billion dollars each. Also to be fought is the perennial debate over how much to devote to the administration's `` Star Wars'' Strategic Defense Initiative and how much money to give to rail-mobile MX missiles versus the single-warhead Midgetman. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to complete work on the 13 basic spending bills needed to run the government in the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also is pushing ahead on legislation from child care to clean air and budget cuts. Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was executive assistant to former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, but numerous witnesses have described her as almost a surrogate Cabinet member who was heavily involved in funneling department money to well-placed Republicans. `` Miss <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> has chosen to take the Fifth Amendment, and we very much hope that she will change her mind,'' said subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` But we will need to get at her role, if she's unprepared to testify, through individuals who had close contact with her. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plans to hold a drafting session to deal with responses to last month's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision that burning the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag is a protected form of political expression. The panel's subcommittee on constitutional rights completed hearings last week on the issue. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is divided over whether to seek a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration or to address the matter through a simple change in the law. After working behind closed doors most of last week, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators on a $ 166 bailout plan for the savings and loan industry will meet Tuesday with hopes of nailing down a final package. The major remaining disagreement is how to raise the $ 50 billion needed immediately to cover the loss of federally insured deposits in some 500 S & amp; Ls at or near insolvency because of poor and often fraudulent lending. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> want to raise the money through 30-year private bonds in order to prevent the bailout from swelling the federal deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and Democrats would borrow the money directly through the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, but exempt the amount from annual deficit reduction targets. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> could vote as early as Thursday on the nomination of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assistant attorney general for civil rights at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The black former sheriff of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, is opposed by many civil rights groups for lack of experience, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contends he will be a tough enforcer of anti-discrimination laws. And the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> continues work on a tax bill, with members apparently divided almost down the middle on a proposal favored by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reduce taxes on capital gains. The panel also will try to find a way to change the surtax that finances the catastrophic health insurance program for older Americans. Higher income retirees who pay most of the cost of the program have been lobbying the committee to spread the cost among all taxpayers, not just older citizens.

<HEAD>Study Targets Video Display Terminal Users</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new federally funded study on 8,000 women office workers aims to resolve persistent questions over whether video display terminals can harm the health of people who use them. Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, whose House Government Operations subcommittee has held hearings on VDTs, said the two-year, $ 2 million study by <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is long overdue. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said he had urged the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for several years to fund research `` that could determine whether VDTs cause serious harm, especially for pregnant women who use them.'' `` They have been terribly slow to respond, partly due to encouragement by several large corporations to avoid this kind of research,'' he said. `` Meanwhile, the potential harm has increased dramatically as the number of VDT users has multiplied.'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> calls the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> epidemiological study _ being funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> _ `` an important first step'' toward resolving the health issue. The study comes in the wake of a report issued last month by the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, saying more research is needed to explore the potential health risks of power frequency electromagnetic fields _ particularly their effects on the nervous system and possible role in promoting cancer. The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> report said that while most public concern has focused on high-voltage transmission lines, more attention should be paid to exposure to such fields from other sources such as household and office wiring, appliances and other electrical equipment, including VDTs. `` It is now clear that 60 Hz -LRB- cycles per second -RRB- and other low frequency electromagnetic fields can interact with individual cells and organs to produce biological changes,'' it said. `` The nature of these interactions is subtle and complex. The implications of these interactions for public health remain unclear, but there are legitimate reasons for concern.'' <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> study's principal investigator, said it will be conducted in four cities _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and an as yet undetermined city in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Both union and non-union workplaces will be included. Dr. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> said a major difference between the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> project and previous epidemiological studies in this country is that in addition to gathering health-history data through questionnaires, `` we are going to be looking at reproductive effects prospectively. That is, we're going to be following women forward in time.'' `` We'll be identifying their exposure or their use of video display terminals, and then seeing whether or not they get pregnant and following the course of the pregnancy,'' she said. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on science, technology and space, said `` there are still many unanswered questions about the potential health effects of VDTs and of electromagnetic fields generally, but there is no longer any doubt that this form of radiation can cause some biochemical changes. `` The decision by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> to support <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION>'s study is an important step, but more is needed,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` Government must expand its research program and do more to ensure that private industry is preparing solutions should the evidence warrant it.'' Also welcoming the study was Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaydos </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and safety, which plans to hold further hearings on the VDT issue early next year `` I am concerned about the health hazards faced by office workers, especially those who use video display terminals for long periods of time during the working day,'' <PERSON> Gaydos </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Opposition to Anti-Abortion Candidates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans by nearly a 2-1 margin are inclined to oppose anti-abortion candidates for their state legislatures and to support legal abortion in their states, a national poll has found. As lawmakers across the country prepare to take up new abortion laws, 38 percent of respondents to the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll said they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who firmly opposes abortion. The same number said abortion would n't matter much in their vote, while the smallest group _ about two in 10 _ said they would be more apt to vote for a candidate who took a strong anti-abortion position. Moreover, 63 percent of the 1,163 adults polled said they would want abortion to be legal in their state if the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversed its 1973 ruling that made abortion a constitutional right and let each state make its own abortion laws. That support for legal abortion was up slightly from 57 percent in an MG-AP poll in March. Similarly, support for the 1973 ruling in the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> case was up to 59 percent, from 53 percent. While those increases were within the poll's margin of error, similar movement in several questions indicated a slight rise in pro-choice opinion since the high court decision July 3 that permitted states to increase restrictions on abortion. The new survey, conducted July 7-16, had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. While most respondents expressed general support for legal abortion, they were split on specific restrictions permitted in the recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. Among those findings: _ Sixty-five percent said abortions at public hospitals should be legal, but that fell to 51 percent when respondents were asked specifically about abortions that are not required to save the mother's life The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said states can ban such abortions from public hospitals. _ Respondents split about evenly on whether it should be legal for public health employees to perform or assist in abortions The court said that, too, can be barred by the states when the mother's life is not at risk _ Respondents strongly supported mandatory pre-abortion tests to see if fetuses that are at least 20 weeks old can survive outside the womb, with 62 percent in favor The high court said such tests can be required. _ By 54-38 percent, with 8 percent undecided, respondents said it should be legal to use public funds to counsel women about the availability of abortion The court left that issue undecided. Overall, 48 percent said they opposed the July 3 ruling, 43 percent favored it and 9 percent were unsure. That was a split in opinion given the margin of error. As in previous polls, general questions on abortion produced divided views, reflecting public discomfort with an issue that pits the rights of pregnant women with concern for their fetuses. Sixty-seven percent said a woman should be allowed to have an abortion if she wants one and her doctor agrees to it; 25 percent said not, and 8 percent were undecided. On the other hand, 42 percent said they would support a constitutional amendment to ban most abortions. Fifty-three percent opposed such an amendment and the rest were undecided. Younger, more educated and wealthier people were more apt to support legal abortion, as were residents of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and the West and big-city dwellers. People who called themselves conservatives were far more likely to oppose abortion: Just 42 percent of conservatives supported the 1973 ruling, compared with 66 percent of moderates and 80 percent of liberals. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews July 7-16 with 1,163 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday, a random phenomenon. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if every adult American were asked the same questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups; it is five points for people who called themselves conservatives, for example. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100: 1. If a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor agrees to it, should she be allowed to have an abortion, or not? Yes: 67 percent. No: 25 percent. Do n't know or no answer: 8 percent. 2. Would you vote for or against a candidate just on the basis of that candidate's position on the abortion issue? Yes: 32. No: 61. DK-NA: 7. 3. If a candidate for your state legislature is firmly opposed to abortion, would that make you more likely to vote for that candidate, or less likely, or would n't it matter much? More: 21. Less: 38. Would n't matter: 38. DK-NA: 3. 4a. Should it be legal or illegal for abortions to be done at public hospitals? Legal: 65. Illegal: 26. DK-NA: 9. b -LRB- If legal -RRB- Does that include abortions that are not necessary to save the mother's life? Yes: 78. No: 18. DK-NA: 4. 5a. Should it be legal or illegal or public health employees to perform or assist in abortions? Legal: 44. Illegal: 43. DK-NA: 13. b -LRB- If legal -RRB- Does that include abortions that are not necessary to save the mother's life? Yes: 90. No: 9. DK-NA: 2. 6. Should it be legal or illegal to use public funds to counsel women about the availability of abortion? Legal: 54. Illegal: 38. DK-NA: 8. 7. If a woman who is at least 20 weeks pregnant wants an abortion, should the doctor first be required to determine whether the fetus can survive outside the womb, or not? Yes: 62. No: 21. DK-NA: 17. 8a. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> this month gave the states more power to restrict abortions. Do you favor or oppose that ruling? Favor: 43. Oppose 48. DK-NA: 9. b -LRB- If oppose -RRB- Is that because you wanted the court to do more to restrict abortions, or because you think the court did too much to restrict abortions? Wanted more: 8. Too much: 86. DK-NA: 7. 9. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1973 that a woman can have an abortion if she wants one at any time during the first three months of pregnancy. Do you favor or oppose that ruling? Favor: 59. Oppose: 36. DK-NA: 5. 10. If the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversed its 1973 ruling and let each state make its own abortion laws, abortion could become legal in some states and illegal in others. Would you want abortion to be legal or illegal in your state? Legal: 63. Illegal: 31. DK-NA: 7. 11. If abortion was illegal in your state, do you think that would stop most women there who want abortions from having them, or would most of them go to another state where it was legal? Stop: 7. Go: 87. DK-NA: 6. 12. Would you favor or oppose a constitutional amendment that would make abortions illegal nationwide, except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother? Favor: 42.

 When it comes to teaching medical students about mental illness, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> does n't go by the book. He makes movies. `` A lot of the videotapes I make are designed to make people feel like they really are in the patient's shoes,'' said <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON>, an adolescent psychiatrist at <ORGANIZATION> Chestnut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and an associate professor of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Like, what does it feel like to be psychotic. The audience gets confused. They really begin to take on some of the feelings that are being portrayed.'' <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON>, 40, has produced more than 100 features since he began using videotapes as a teaching tool a decade ago while at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. About half are for sale to medical schools throughout the country. The videos range from 8 minutes to two hours in length and cost from $ 50 to $ 1,200. A year and a half ago, <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> began working on a new educational series called `` Medicine Playhouse'' at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Each episode presents an emotional, medical or philosophical problem typically faced by health professionals. A question-and-answer session with an expert in the field is held after each show. `` It's sort of a <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wobegone </LOCATION> approach to medical education,'' <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> said, referring to the mythical place made famous by humorist <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> on his radio show, `` A Prairie Home Companion.'' Students say the videos are a good learning tool. `` It's much more helpful for a medical student to observe a patient,'' said <PERSON> Kellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gooding </PERSON>, 24, a third-year student at the medical school. `` It stays in your mind much longer if you can actually see a schizophrenic or whatever, rather than just reading about it. You might just remember something a couple of days if you read it. If you see it on the screen, you might remember it for the rest of your life.'' `` The videos show a really comprehensive picture,'' said <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, 23, also a third-year student. `` It shows you as it is _ real people in real life. In a book, they would break a subject down into one component and then another.'' Some of the videotapes, <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> said, make medical students squirm. In one video, shot in black-and-white and titled simply, `` Depression,'' a loud clock ticks in the background as cameras close in from different angles on the troubled face of an actor. `` It's just 15 minutes long but it seems like it runs for an eternity,'' <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> said. `` I've had people actually come up and tell me they feel suicidal after watching it, even though the word is never mentioned.'' In another, called `` Paranoia,'' a man grows more and more anxious as passengers riding on a city bus turn around in their seats and begin staring at him. He admits his videos may not be right for everyone. `` About 10 or 15 percent of the students do n't learn well using the videotapes,'' <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> said. `` They'd be better off with books or a lecture. Some people just are n't good visual learners. `` But that's OK. I do n't think many lectures in medical school reach 85 percent of the students,'' he said.

<HEAD>Government Considers Duty on Imports of Canadian Pork</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prospective <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> levy on imports of unprocessed fresh, chilled and frozen pork from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> could add further to a growing number of live hogs coming across the border, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysis. Last week the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ruled in a `` final determination'' that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s pork is being subsidized. The ruling now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which has 45 days to decide whether the imports are hurting American hog farmers. If the commission agrees with the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> ruling, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> will be ordered to collect countervailing duties on imports of Canadian pork to offset the benefits of the subsidies. The Commerce investigation did not include processed or preserved pork products such as canned hams, bacon, sausage or ground pork. Countervailing duties have been levied on imports of live hogs from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> the past four years. Overall, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the world's largest pork importer, with about 1.14 billion pounds, carcass weight equivalent, imported last year, approximately 7 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption, according to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> supplied almost 45 percent of the 1988 pork imports; <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, 29 percent; and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, 11 percent. The remainder comes mainly from other Eastern European countries. Pork imports during the first four months of this year totaled about 333 million pounds, down 17 percent from January-April 1988, the report said. Imports from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> were `` substantially below'' the year-earlier level, while shipments from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were up slightly. `` Canadian hog and pork prices remain below last year, which has encouraged domestic consumption and diverted some supply from the export market,'' the report said. `` Despite near-record year-ago hog slaughter, Canadian statistics indicate that total exports of pork through the end of May were about 8 percent below 1988 levels.'' Earlier this year there was a wide spread between western Canadian hog prices and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prices, the report said. That provided a strong incentive for western Canadian producers to ship live hogs to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. The spread narrowed in April, and imports of live hogs from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> declined to less than half of their March level _ but still were 18 percent more than a year earlier. Hog imports from all sources for the January-April period totaled 475,845 head, the report said. That was 125 percent above the same period in 1988. Canadian production this year is expected to be down about 2 percent from 1988 because of herd liquidations prompted by lower hog prices. `` The addition of a countervailing duty deposit on fresh, chilled and frozen pork imports from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is expected to reinforce the existing shift towards imports of Canadian hogs,'' the report said. <PERSON> Shayle </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shagam </PERSON>, an economist in the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency, said in another report that the world pork trade is small relative to total production and that a handful of countries are involved. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is the largest pork producer, accounting for almost a third of the world's total last year, but the country's huge population requires most of the production, <PERSON> Shagam </PERSON> said. Last year <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was the fourth largest pork exporter, with live hogs and pork going to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, and frozen pork to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. On an individual country basis, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the second largest pork producer but ranks fourth when the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are included. As well as being the leading pork importer, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is sixth in the world as an exporter. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the biggest market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is another large buyer. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> ranks seventh in the world as a pork producer, turning out much more than it requires domestically, <PERSON> Shagam </PERSON> said. Exports currently are about 22 percent of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s production. Almost 90 percent goes to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 9 percent to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was third as an exporter last year. `` As a result of large domestic pork supplies, imports by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will remain fairly steady, with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> increasing its relative share of the market,'' <PERSON> Shagam </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Shagam </PERSON> added that the mix between hogs and pork from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will depend on relative wage rates in the meatpacking industry and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> countervailing duties on imports from there.

<HEAD>Colleges say Minority Recruiting Results Fall Short</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An overwhelming majority of colleges and universities are trying to attract and retain more minority students but few of their efforts are bearing fruit, says a new report on `` Campus Trends, 1989.'' Eight in 10 administrators responding to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> reported either `` a lot'' or `` some'' activity toward those goals on their campuses. But only one in four said minority enrollment had increased in the 1988-89 school year. `` We obviously would rather see more progress,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Khawas </PERSON>, an ACE vice president and author of the report. `` It's encouraging that there's a tremendous level of activity But the actual results fall short.'' ACE surveyed senior academic administrators at 366 colleges and universities for its sixth annual campus trends report. Other findings showed that faculty shortages and inadequate physical facilities are pressing concerns on campus. Many of the questions on minorities were based on recommendations from a recent ACE publication called `` Minorities on Campus: A Handbook for Enhancing Diversity.'' Only 25 percent of the administrators said their enrollment of blacks, Hispanics and Asians had risen during 1988-89 and only 10 percent reported an increase in American Indian students. The same proportion of institutions reported they were making special efforts to increase minority faculty members. But only 17 percent said they offer incentives to academic departments to hire minorities and only 25 percent reported a net gain in minority faculty over the previous year. While some studies have predicted overall faculty shortages in the mid-1990s, <PERSON> El-Khawas </PERSON> said her survey found that the problem already exists. Half of the administrators reported it is taking longer to find qualified people for full-time faculty positions. Half also said they are having greater difficulty getting top applicants to accept positions when they are offered _ up from 25 percent in 1987. Specifically, four in 10 institutions reported problems finding qualified full-time computer science professors. One in three cited similar problems for business; mathematics and health professions each were mentioned by one in four schools. `` The labor market for faculty is tightening right now,'' said <PERSON> El-Khawas </PERSON>. `` The real dilemmas for colleges are going to be starting much sooner than 1995.'' El-Khawas attributed the problem to a number of factors, among them an inadequate number of doctorate holders; an increasing number of Ph.D.'s going into private industry; a greater proportion of doctoral degrees earned by foreigners; accelerating retirement of faculty members; and expanding student enrollment. More than 71 percent of the administrators in the survey reported increased overall enrollment in the 1988-89 school year and half said the size of their full-time faculty had grown. Half also said they expect the pace of retirement among full-time faculty to accelerate in the next few years. The result is bound to be a highly competitive situation, <PERSON> El-Khawas </PERSON> said, with universities offering incentives to keep people from retiring, higher salaries to people in certain fields, and lures designed to attract professors from other universities. Class size may also increase, she said. Other findings: _ Only 32 percent of the administrators felt their physical plant was excellent or very good Another third said plant renovation and renewal will be a significant problem in the next five years, and more than half predicted their facilities will not be adequate to last the next decade. _ About half of the administrators said they believe assessments of student learning, mandated in large part by states, will `` significantly improve'' undergraduate education But 37 percent said that so far, the process has resulted mainly in new reporting requirements to the state. _ Basic skills testing is in place at 65 percent of schools and another 19 percent are planning such tests _ Half of the colleges and universities now assess writing and 27 percent report that writing assessment is in the planning stages _ Close to half of the schools plan to assess students' critical thinking skills and 14 percent already do so ACE is the umbrella group for the nation's colleges and universities. Its campus trends survey was adjusted to reflect the country's 2,500 general institutions of higher education. Seminaries, art schools, stand-alone graduate schools and other specialized institutions were not included. The margin of error for the survey was 2 percent.

 <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> says he's trying to forget the spring of 1980, when his silver-buying binge crashed to an end and began unraveling one of the world's greatest fortunes. He used to be in the oil business, in ranching and farming, he told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korner </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` Lately, it's hiring lawyers and defending lawsuits. The Hunt brothers' tax case begins its third week today and is expected to last about a month. Bunker Hunt is contesting $ 155 million in 1982 taxes the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> says are owed from the dissolution of a partnership set up to pay off the brothers' debts. His brother <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> is contesting more than $ 158 million in 1982 taxes, while younger brother <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> football team, is contesting $ 505,377 in taxes. <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> testified Friday, `` I do n't go around trying to remember what happened in the spring of 1980. It caused me tremendous losses, it caused me tax problems.'' Banks once eager to lend him money `` were trying to get their arms around as much collateral as possible,'' he said _ to the point of demanding `` pictures on the wall'' and even his brother's Rolex watch <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> told the court he could not recall whether one document he signed was five or 5,000 pages long or whether he signed a promissory note for $ 272 million after Silver Thursday, the day in late March 1980 when silver prices collapsed. <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> owned one-third of the world's supply of silver bullion from a silver-shopping spree that began in 1973, government attorneys claim. As the price tumbled to $ 10 an ounce from $ 50 an ounce, the brothers found themselves with debts totaling as much as $ 2 billion and creditors threatening the family's beloved <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> creditors `` dictated'' the terms of the partnership with Placid set up to repay the Hunt brothers' debts from their soured silver investments, he said `` The net effect was we did n't have control over our business. That's why I'm sitting here in court, because of the structure the banks put us in,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. Since then, <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> and Placid have filed for protection from creditors in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>; Bunker and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> have been accused of attempting to corner the silver market by the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>; and a jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last year found Bunker, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> and two others had conspired to manipulate and monopolize the silver market and defraud investors. <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>, the first of the brothers to testify in the non-jury trial, recalled one day after Silver Thursday when he signed documents while surrounded by attorneys. `` I signed documents for three or four hours, just as fast as I could,'' he said. `` There must have been thousands and thousands of documents I signed, they would probably go to the ceiling of this room here if they were stacked up end to end.'' <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> said he remembers <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Placid </PERSON>'s vice president and chief financial officer, telling him that the banks `` were calling all the shots, it was pretty much their party'' as they set up the partnership to repay the silver loans.

 Like scouts in major league baseball, a pair of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats are looking for talent to keep their team winning atop <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. But figuring out which potential congressional candidates might get a contract from the voters is a tricky task of balancing the facts _ such as money _ with the intangibles, appearance and that `` hungry look.'' Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., the committee's recruiting chairman, met this weekend with potential candidates in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ the two targeted congressional districts Democrats say they might take from the In 1988, Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> picked up seats despite the big <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> win on the presidential level. `` We out-hustled and we out-recruited the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in terms of candidates,'' said <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>. On their first trip of the 1990 cycle, the Democrats' task was n't finding the potential candidates; it was looking for which one was most likely to win. In <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> met with four Democrats interested in trying to unseat freshman Rep. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Machtley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, who beat longtime incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fernand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>'s personal finances became the subject of a federal probe. They consider <PERSON> Machtley </PERSON> a fluke, and the national Democrats want to mount a strong challenge in 1990. Party rules do n't allow the national Democrats to take sides in a primary, so they ca n't handpick their candidate. But they can pressure the locals to unite behind a candidate. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, who nearly beat <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> in the primary last year, told <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> he was in the race. State Reps. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafayette </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Teitz </PERSON> said they also were lookin, as did <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>. In separate meetings with each, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> tried to learn about the public skills and personal drive of the candidate: `` What would get you into it?'' `` How much money can you raise by the end of the year?'' `` What do you think of -LRB- other Democratic candidate -RRB-'' They ask about local issues and how the national party can help, and dole out advice. `` You realize the easiest way to clear the field is to have the money,'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> tells one. And eventually, he warns, that may involve something like mortgaging one's home to stay in the race. The two congressmen repeated the process in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s first congressional district. There, incumbent Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has announced for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and Democrats say they've got a good shot. `` We'd love to have a toehold up here,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> is the only <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> state with no Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Again, the Democrats would like to avoid a costly and divisive primary but it appears one is down the road. Conservative Democrat <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, a state senator and <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> restaurateur, has already formed an exploratory campaign committee. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, an attorney and moderate who lost to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> last year, says he's in it, too. And two others are looking, former state party chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> and stockbroker and party activist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Demers </PERSON>, who ran in 1986. `` If all of us go at it ... I do n't think the seat is winnable,'' warns <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, urging the national officials to do what they can to help avoid a primary.

 Every working day, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutlakhmetov </PERSON> boards an orange bus with six shoulder-high wheels that carries him and other miners 43 miles across the rolling Siberian plateau to the Taldinski Severni Open Pit Mine. On Friday, <PERSON> Kutlakhmetov </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON>, boarded the bus for the first time in more than a week. He sped off to explain to other miners the details of a 35-point agreement that ended the first Soviet industrial strike in 60 years. Lurching along the bumpy, thinly asphalted road that links city and mine, the bus passed birch, aspen and pine forests, tiny settlements of log cabins with carved wooden trims and kitchen gardens. Small herds of goats and cows, and an occasional horse, could be seen in the lanes. As the sun rose slowly, burning off a thick morning mist, the bus arrived at the pit's brick headquarters, and the miners began to slap each other's shoulders in greeting and discuss the agreement that ended their unprecedented strike. <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON> stepped up to the landing and, waving the agreement, began to explain. `` Do we get three years maternity leave?'' shouted one woman, who worked in the mine offices. `` That's in there,'' replied <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON>. `` What about the time it takes us to get here on the bus?'' shouted a man. `` We'll get paid from the time we check in, but not for commuting,'' said <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON>. The session continued for a half hour, as miners asked about grievances that were advanced at Taldinski Severni but may or may not have been included in the demands of the strike committee formed the week before for the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, the country's second largest coal-producing region At last, the workers were satisfied that if they had not won every point, they had at least seized the right to strike, a right not guaranteed by Soviet law. They beamed with new-found confidence. `` It's a victory over the system that we've had in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the past 70 years, a system in which we work hard but get little in return,'' said <PERSON> Pyotr </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Menayev </PERSON>, an engineer. Another miner, <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sizikov </PERSON>, agreed that it was a victory, but `` it would have been a bigger victory if we had continued the strike.'' Sensitive to the doubts of miners like <PERSON> Sizikov </PERSON>, the regional strike committee renamed itself the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and remained in session to pressure authorities to keep the bargain. `` If they do n't, we go back on strike. That's in the agreement,'' said <PERSON> Kutlakhmetov </PERSON>. Mine managers, who backed most of the strike demands, were pleased at the most import government concession _ allowing mines to form local assocations that will have a greater say in running the industry, which remains under the general control of the <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is better to be master in your own house,'' said <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevnin </PERSON>, the main production engineer at the mine. `` The strike will improve our lives. And the agreement will move us closer to real economic independence.'' The miners, still skeptical of the government's intention of keeping the deal, boarded the bus once again to drive the final few miles to the pit. Deep down in the crater, <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demski </PERSON> clambered into the cabin of a giant crane and began using the controls to scoop small mountains of coal into oversize dump trucks, resuming delivery of fuel to the state. `` We got little concrete,'' said <PERSON> Demski </PERSON>, as he operated the shovel. `` Maybe there will be more.'' Another worker in the crane cabin, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorlov </PERSON>, nodded his head, and said, `` It was right to strike.''

 More than 80 of the dead in the 19-month uprising against Israeli rule are Palestinians killed by their own people, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> against <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> violence is growing as the revolt drags on without a political resolution. Why are Palestinians killing Palestinians? Most of those killed were accused of being informers or otherwise collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But some Palestinian sources say political battles over the direction of the `` intefadeh,'' or uprising, have turned violent and bred threats, car burnings and even murder. Israeli officials claim the slayings support their position that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> fosters terrorism. But Palestinian sources say at least some of the violence is by radicals challenging <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s calls for restraint. For whatever reason, the tempo has accelerated. From the start of the uprising in December 1987 to the end of last year, 22 Palestinians were killed by fellow Arabs. So far this year, at least 61 have been slain. In addition to those slayings, the deaths of at least 518 Palestinians have been attributed to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or civilians. Thirty-eight Israelis have also been killed. The uprising, aimed at ending <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 22-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, has employed brute force against uncooperative Palestinians from its first days, even as clashes raged between the territories' residents and the Israeli army. Those who challenged the uprising's efforts to break ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were threatened, beaten and sometimes had their cars or houses set ablaze. Often the political message was clear. After the PLO-backed leaders of the uprising called for <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to stop working as police for the military government, a Arab policeman was stabbed to death in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>. His body, wrapped in a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag, was dumped on his mother's doorstep. Shortly thereafter, several hundred Arab policemen quit their jobs. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>, appointed mayor of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after it deposed the elected mayor, has survived a stabbing attack. His house was set afire during the uprising. He now employs bodyguards. The motives for some murders seem religious or moral, especially in attacks by the Moslem fundamentalist movement <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, or Zeal, a non-PLO group that has targeted drug dealers and prostitutes. In other cases, motives have been cloudy _ Palestinians say a victim was a collaborator, while army officials saying he was killed in criminal or family feuds. Palestinians say some of those slain were simply thugs who sold their services to anyone, including <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. While Palestinians have maintained the targets were those who thwarted the revolt for selfish reasons, some actions have had political purposes. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> issued a public death threat to Mayor <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> suggested suspending the uprising as a signal to encourage <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> compromise. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, masked men have twice visited and threatened local Palestinians who met Israeli officials to discuss the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal for elections in the occupied territories as a step toward peace. However, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> announced recently from its headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> that it approved of the meetings and was getting reports from Palestinians who were taking part. Signs of disunity surfaced in May with arson attacks on cars of well-known <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporters in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and the murder of a village leader of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction at <LOCATION> Yaabed </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporters deny that rifts among Palestinians have exploded into violence, blaming the trouble on collaborators or attempts by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to foster disunity. One well-placed source, speaking privately, derided <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> claims that the internal debate was not turning violent. He said both the recent car burnings and the slaying of the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> Yaabed </LOCATION> village were evidence of a split in <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s own faction. The victim, he said, was a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> treasurer who rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> rebel's demand for money to escalate the revolt. Two days later, the treasurer was found slain outside the village mosque. The source said the split over tactics reflected both differences among <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials abroad and resentment by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders in the villages and refugee camps that have been the real battleground of the uprising. He said many local leaders spent years in prison for anti-Israeli activities but see the real power for guiding the uprising still held by traditional ruling <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> families in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Israeli officials have pointed to the dissent and violence among Palestinians as evidence that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is using murder as a weapon to rein in those who would be willing to cast off <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership and accept <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s peace initiative. Palestinians deny this charge. They note that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has failed to produce one specific case of this type of political murder.

 The number of AIDS cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has hit the 100,000 mark. The report for the 100,000 th recorded case some time in recent weeks became part of the data files at Centers for Disease Controls, where the cumulative number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AIDS cases is tabulated When the monthly total for July is released in late August, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> experts are sure that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s official count of total AIDS cases will for the first time officially pass 100,000. Many experts have admitted that the AIDS case total is more of a rough estimate than a precise count, but the official total emphasizes that the dreadful statistical march of AIDS has not retreated or slowed. By 1992, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> expects there will be a cumulative total of 365,000 confirmed cases of AIDS. The agency also predicts that within three years the total number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents killed by AIDS will reach 263,000.

<NOTE>Federal Drug Convictions Jump 161.4 Percent Between 1980 And 1987</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says drug convictions jumped 161.4 percent between 1980 and 1987, paced by a 48.7 percent increase in defendants found guilty of federal crimes. Results of a study released Sunday showed that by 1987 a larger proportion of convicted defendants received prison terms from federal judges and their sentences were on average 11 months longer than those imposed in 1980, the department said. The number of criminal defendants convicted in federal courts nationwide increased from 29,943 in 1980 to 44,518 percent in 1987, according to the study prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. The conviction rate for defendants prosecuted in federal courts increased from 76 percent in 1980 to 81 percent in 1987, the study said. The figures demonstrated the need for more money to build additional prisons to house the increasing numbers of convicted defendants sent behind bars by federal judges, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in a statement. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed spending $ 1.5 billion to add 24,000 beds to the overcrowded federal prison system.

<NOTE>Plan Would Offer Health Care for All, Set National Spending Cap</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging today was to propose an overhaul of the government's health care system that would offer coverage to all Americans and limit overall spending for medical care. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Sunday the measure would provide medical coverage to the 37 million Americans who currently are uninsured and improve benefits for the 200 million people, or 85 percent of Americans, who are underinsured against catastrophic long-term illness In addition, the legislation for the first time would set a cap on the nation's total spending for health care, limiting expenditures to 12 percent of the gross national product, the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic activity. <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>'s plan is among many that have been proposed to establish a comprehensive health care program for the nation that would better protect uninsured and underinsured Americans. From 1980 through 1987, health care costs rose at an average rate of 10.4 percent, or 3.3 percent faster than the GNP. Under the current system, these costs are expected to reach 13 percent of GNP by 1995 and nearly 15 percent by the year 2000.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key barometer rose and the dollar fell against the Japanese yen Monday despite news that Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> will resign. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues, which gained 234.56 points last Friday, added 193.90 points or 0.69 percent, to finish at 34,093.33. The dollar started at 143.25 yen, up 1.10 yen from last Friday's 142.15 yen close, but fell steadily, ending the day at 141.95 yen On the stock market, `` it appears that the market shrugged off the election results,'' said <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and its creditor banks finally agree on the key points of a debt-reduction package, providing the first victory for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's effort to ease the $ 1.3 trillion Third World debt burden. The agreement announced late Sunday night ended two days of intense talks at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> where Mexican officials and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankers were joined by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. In the final package, negotiators representing the commercial banks agreed to choose from three options for providing assistance. They can cut the principal on the old loans by 35 percent, reduce the interest rate they are charging to 6.25 percent or provide new loans to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials predicted that the debt-relief package could slash by up to one-third the $ 4.5 billion <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is paying annually to service the $ 54 billion it owes to commercial banks. However, officials said the exact amount of debt relief will not be known for some time because each of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s creditor banks must decide on its own the extent to which it will participate in the plan. Still, the agreement signified the first tangible result for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's debt-reduction plan, which was unveiled by <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> on March 10. The strategy seeks to provide various incentives for commercial banks to voluntarily reduce the amount of Third World debt they hold. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who had lobbied intensely for the final agreement, hailed the package as `` a major step forward in the implementation'' of the debt-reduction effort. The administration had made <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> the test-case for the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan, believing that an agreement with the developing world's second-largest debtor would establish precedents for deals with other countries Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> went on nationwide television Sunday night to praise the final package, saying, `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has opened the way for other nations with similar problems.'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said the debt reduction plan answered `` the cry of Mexicans to return to growth'' but he cautioned Mexican citizens, `` do n't look for spectacular results overnight.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had hoped to have a completed Mexican debt plan to present to the seven-nation economic summit last week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. But even without a deal, the final summit communique included a strong endorsement of the approach. In an effort to break the stalemate, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> brought the negotiators to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Saturday and Sunday to resolve the remaining issues. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> described the final talks as `` difficult, complex and tense.'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had begun the discussions demanding that the banks cut <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt by 55 percent. Others participating in the final round of negotiations were Mexican Finance Minister <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> and head of the 15-bank committee which bargains for the hundreds of banks to which <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> owes money. In a joint statement from the Mexican government and the banks, the two sides said they had reached agreement on the main points of the financing package with the expectation that it would be accepted by `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s approximately 500 creditor banks worldwide.'' The debt reduction options include slashing the principal on old loans by 35 percent or reducing the interest rate banks receive to 6.25 percent. Banks taking either of these options would be able to get guarantees against default on the remaining debt from the 151-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> or its sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The joint statement estimated that $ 7 billion will be available from the international lending organizations and other sources, including <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, to support the debt-reduction and interest-rate reduction efforts for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In conjunction with the Mexican agreement, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is willing to provide up to $ 2 billion in short-term financing to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to tide the country over until the new loans begin arriving later this year. He said other countries would help in providing this bridge loan. Officials said one of the final issues resolved Sunday night involved a `` readjustment clause'' that would increase debt payments once the Mexican economy rebounds. One official, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, said both sides agreed to tie increased debt payments to any improvements in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s export sales after the year 1996. According to the joint statement, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> also agreed to provide opportunities for the banks to exchange about $ 1 billion of debt annually for ownership of factories and other direct investments in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, under a process known as a debt-for-equity swap. The $ 54 billion owed to private banks represents about half of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s $ 107 billion foreign debt, the second largest in the developing world after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s.

<HEAD>Mecham Still Looms Large on Arizona Political Stage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than a year after former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was driven from office in disgrace, he casts a shadow over <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> politics as he campaigns to regain his old job. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s conservative ideas dominate the Republican agenda and his successor, Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, has been unable to marshal support in her own party or win battles with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> majority in the Legislature. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was elected in 1986 in a three-way race; he got just 40 percent of the vote. That inspired a law requiring the governor to receive at least 50 percent of the vote. Some <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporters admit he would have trouble winning a clear majority. But they say he may have enough solid support to overcome any moderate Republican opponent in the primary. That leaves many Republicans in a quandary. What they'd really like, said freshman state Sen. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, is `` somebody with <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s philosophy but not his cantankerousness, at least as he's been portrayed. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, whose only opponent so far is millionaire developer <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> <PERSON> Symington </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, exudes confidence about the September 1990 primary, and the general election that follows. `` I'm going to win the cotton-picking election,'' he said. `` You can mark that on the wall if you wish.'' The blunt-talking, 65-year-old auto dealer with four failed gubernatorial campaigns behind him stunned <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> with his 1986 victory. From the start, he demonstrated a remarkable ability to offend many groups. In his first month in office, he rescinded the state's <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> holiday, questioning the civil rights leader's stature and saying that former Gov <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> had lacked the authority to decree the holiday. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also endorsed a book that characterized blacks as `` pickaninnies,'' stated that a political enemy was spying on him with laser beams, and was reported to have associates with criminal records. He was impeached in February 1988 on charges of misusing a state protocol fund, obstructing a probe into a death threat and concealing a developer's $ 350,000 campaign loan. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted and ousted him two months later on the first two charges before voters could make their own decision in a recall election that had been scheduled for May. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> dropped the loan concealment charge, and a jury subsequently acquitted him of wrongdoing. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> earlier this month challenged his impeachment and demanded the reinstatement of $ 570,000 in expenses. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was succeeded by Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who since 1975 had been secretary of state, a largely ceremonial, elected post similar to the lieutenant governor in other states. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> enjoyed popularity and bipartisan support early on, but she failed to get her way on several key issues during the legislative session that ended in June. Moderate Republicans sided with conservatives in opposing Mofford initiatives to increase taxes and spending, instead cutting the state's contribution to government pension funds. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has advocated slashing taxes and state spending. The Legislature also defeated Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s bid to restore the King holiday. `` Rose basically is still trying to find her sea legs,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Goudinoff </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> political science professor. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, 67, said she will run for re-election, although aides say she has n't yet begun fundraising. No other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate has announced. The perfect candidate, <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said, would combine <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s conservatism with Mofford's geniality Some sense the impeachment is unfinished business for many Arizonans. `` I think <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> needs to vote on the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> situation,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who cast one of the few votes against impeachment last year. Still, she added, `` We can not allow any one person to be the issue of the campaign.''

 The agreement with foreign banks to reduce <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt burden will give <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> both more cash for investment and an important psychological boost after years of austerity and stagnation. `` The resources that were being sent outside the country can now be channeled into investment, growth and creating jobs,'' President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> said in a triumphant televised address Sunday night. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s total debt burden is estimated at $ 107 billion _ with $ 54 billion owed to private banks _ and the agreement is expected to cut billions from the amount <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has to pay to service its debt to the banks. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> got into trouble during the oil boom, when developing nations and banks thought the price of oil would keep going up. When the price crashed in 1982, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was suddenly left without enough money to make payments on the billions it had borrowed. The result was six years of belt-tightening under the administration of President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. The government had to take harsh measures to get the money to make payments and that left little for development. Private companies, too, could n't borrow money to invest in new plants or equipment. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economy slowed down and inflation went up _ to over 150 percent annually some years. The peso dropped like a brick against the dollar from eight to the dollar in the mid-1970s to 2,500 to the dollar today. The average Mexican paycheck lost about half its buying power. The austerity affected everything from the peso to pollution _ 95 percent of all cars in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> are more than five years old, most bought before the crash. `` Every day we worked harder but we were worse off,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said. The country of 85 million was under additional social pressure because of demographics. One million young people were entering the job market every year, but the country had trouble creating even half that many jobs. The pressure was also visible in the erosion of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s power in last year's presidential election <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won with barely 50 percent of the vote, the lowest margin in the history of a party that has given <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> 60 years of stable government. Some of the pressure was relieved by emigration, which continues as one of many factors that gives the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> an interest in its southern neighbor's stability. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was able to argue that it deserved consideration from the banks because it had done everything asked by creditors and had worked hard to restructure its economy. It joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and stopped protecting its economy from foreign competition. The idea, which has been working, was to reduce prices in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and make Mexican industry more competitive on international markets. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> was careful to get President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and institutions such as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> on board before tackling the private banks that were reluctant to write off billions in debt. He also made dramatic crackdowns on corruption and the drug trafficking that had infuriated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In his speech, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said that some of the money saved under the new agreement will go to building infrastructure _ roads, dams, communications _ that he hopes will lay the basis for an eventual growth rate of 6 percent a year. Economists say part of what <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> gains will go to buying back debt at a discount. The rest can be used for investment in infrastructure that could prime the pump for the private sector. With fewer payments to make the government will need to borrow less money, putting less pressure on domestic credit markets and making more available for the private sector at lower rates. More importantly, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> hopes increased confidence and the perception of victory will attract foreign investment and help bring back billions invested abroad by wealthy Mexicans. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> warned his countrymen, economic recovery will not come overnight. `` The agreement does not mean that by some magic trick our problems will cease to exist,'' he said. He promised firm guidance of the economy and honest management of the nation's resources. `` Everybody must continue pushing productivity and maintaining order,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>A Caretaker Prime Minister Who Didn't Last</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> became prime minister on June 2, he was widely expected to be a caretaker who with luck might serve until October while his scandal-plagued party put together a political reform package. His luck turned out to be very bad. Now he will go down in Japanese postwar history as rivaling for shortness the two-month tenure that Prime Minister <PERSON> Tanzan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishibashi </PERSON> had from December 1956 to February 1957. Seldom has a respectable political career crumbled as fast as Uno's. He was in office less than a week when a weekly newsmagazine published a former geisha's allegation that he had paid her to be his mistress. Publishing the story broke a taboo about revealing details of politicians' private affairs. The 66-year-old Uno, who is married, was deeply embarrassed facing opposition questions in parliament as to whether he was suitable to represent <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> abroad when his ex-mistress had complained in print about the way he had treated her. It was about the last thing <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> might have expected to happen to him. Elders in his <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> selected him to be prime minister because his experience as foreign minister would stand <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in good diplomatic stead. He was clean of the bribery scandal that ruled out all the prime ministerial contenders in the party, and otherwise uncontroversial. But allegations against Uno widened, with publications finding other women who claimed sexual relations with him. On June 28, Japanese papers reported that <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> had asked party leaders to let him resign because of the embarrassment. `` I did n't become prime minister because I wanted to,'' Uno was quoted as saying. But he was persuaded to stay on. He attended the summit of the world's seven leading industrial democracies in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in mid-July and led the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> into what became their worst electoral defeat in three decades in Sunday's voting for half the seats in the upper house of Parliament. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s `` woman problem,'' as Japanese media dubbed his personal scandal, was one of many the Liberal Democrats faced in the election campaign. They were distrusted because of the bribery scandal, disliked because of a new sales tax imposed in April, suspected because market-liberalization measures were seen threatening the livelihoods of farmers. This morning, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was calm as he faced reporters and said he would leave office as soon as the party could replace him. `` Ultimate responsibility'' for the election defeat was his, he said, and he hoped the party would choose a new head `` promptly.'' If that process, as expected, takes three or four weeks, Uno will not go down in history as beating Ishibashi's record for a short tenure. But it will be a close call.

 <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>, maintaining his reputation as a young creator, brought out a collection of fun, fantasy, lace and furs on the first day of haute couture showings for next winter. As <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> sweltered under a rare heatwave, top couturiers on Sunday unveiled their luxurious, befurred and feathered models for cooler weather. <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>'s pouf skirt finally ran out of steam. But he's kept a taste for beautiful, opulent fabrics and top-heavy outfits full of quirky, funny ideas. He's a man who takes chances with these expensive fabrics and he usually wins, though not always. The applause after the show was tepid. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnault </PERSON>, head of the Agache financial consortium backing <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>, waffled when asked if the eccentric, creative designer is still a hot money-maker. `` His clothes are beautiful. That's all that counts,'' he said. <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>'s clothes with the draped fichu shoulder, the big hoods or head scarves and collars over tiny skirts are great on the runway, but perhaps not at every party, no matter how splashy. He used a lot of browns, dolling up pinstriped jackets with draped satin fronts and sable cuffs, sometimes teamed with a mole-colored velvet skirt. Mixing up textures with abandon, he put a tiny lame `` damasked'' bolero over a trapeze minidress in shades of mustard and burgundy, with a quilted velvet panel on the skirt. Some of the luxury fantasy was hilarious, till one tried to tote up the cost of the enormous sable parka topping chocolate shorts with braided silk cornrows flipping over them like a reggae singer gone wild _ a mini-fantasy well over $ 30,000. <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>'s violet jersey dress was a soothing contrast to all the show-off fabrics. His little shortie flared coats in faille and satin were wearable. There were wonderful moments like the long, slinky carmine velvet coat with huge sparkling buttons worn over slimming pants embroidered with stars. The brown and khaki silks were always topped up with lively shades of coral, saffron, turquoise or gold. For evening, <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>'s hand-painted pink and green tulle ballerina fantasies and jeweled tunics looked like a Midsummer Night's Dream of luxury. Other ballerina numbers were in rich red velvet and black, always sparkling with touches of gold. The dazzling jeweled boleros and jackets looked like a treasure trove of <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Baba </PERSON>'s Cave. And after <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> discovered his mom's lace-edged satin slip-dress, his versions of lace for the runway simply took off in a froth of glory. The heavy guipure effects, the lame-embroidered dresses in khaki, cream and gold, the damasked and brocade dresses with pheasant or ostrich-feather trim harked back to the best of the negligee looks in the Twenties and Thirties. But things were always a bit on the wild side _ a la <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>. Japanese couturiere <PERSON> Hanae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mori </PERSON>, celebrating 35 years in the fashion business and a new shop in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, showed beautifully crafted clothes with more workmanship than fantasy. Her fit and cut are always impeccable, and the swirling red-black-green harlequin coat over a pine green short sheath is anything but stodgy. Her full-skirted gray flannel suits with black velvet decor and the Mori trademark butterfly pins should please her faithful regulars. Her true couture details _ like satin basketweaving basque waists in suits _ testified to her craftsmanship. She was lavish with fancy fabrics, but her lame-flecked or sequin-embroidered lace numbers were demure rather than daring. The dresses that made one want to weep with joy were the chiffon prints in <LOCATION> Mori </LOCATION>'s `` old'' style _ the feather-light chiffon print landscapes with the most delicate Japanese prints of flowers, trees and birds. <PERSON> Torrente </PERSON>'s forte is showbiz, and she wisely showed plenty of spangled numbers to look great onstage or at a gala dinner. Her three full, long cashmere wraparound coats in emerald, cardinal and rust looked light, easy and warm. Her saffron fitted spencer jacket over an aubergine long, slinky skirt is a good way of easing into evening. And she went all out for late-day glitz: a few jet embroidered dresses had discreet trains. Colorful patchwork jackets had fur or ostrich-feather cuffs. The all-sequined slink would be fine for midnight at <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. Easier to wear would be the tuxedos with big pearl pink satin lapels.

 All 106 opposition members in parliament's lower house resigned today, saying a foreign arms deal that allegedly involved kickbacks had destroyed confidence in Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s government. They are demanding that <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> step down and call new elections. As deputies from deputies from <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chanted `` shame, shame,'' the lawmakers from the 12 opposition parties handed their letters of resignation to Speaker <PERSON> Balram </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakhar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> quietly looked on. Although opposition politicians have in the past boycotted entire sessions of parliament, they had never resigned. Still, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s party holds a solid majority in the 544-member chamber and the opposition's departure likely will have no effect. In a rare display of solidarity, the usually fractious and unruly opposition on Sunday announced its decision to resign, citing an auditor's report on inconsistencies in the 1986 purchase of artillery from a Swedish firm. By giving up their seats, opposition leaders said, they hoped the billion-dollar deal would be a major issue in the next general election, which <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> must call by January. `` Never before has the office of the prime minister been brought into disrepute as under the present incumbent,'' said V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were all elected by the people and now we are going back to them for their verdict on this issue.'' Government officials contend the deal was sanctioned by Sing, who at that time served as finance minister in <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s Cabinet. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> left the governing party in 1987. As he left <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> denied any wrongdoing but added if anyone had proof, `` They should prosecute me.'' Besides the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the opposition parties include the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the Party of the Telugus, the two major Communist parties and seven regional groups. The rest of the seats are controlled by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and independents. After the auditor general's report was released on Tuesday, opposition members in parliament shouted anti-government slogans, called <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> a thief and demanded his resignation. When he refused, they walked out and stalled the proceeedings for three days. The $ 1.4 billion deal has been a major scandal for <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s government because of allegations that the Swedish firm <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> paid kickbacks to secure the contract Newspapers and opposition politicians say kickbacks amounting to at least $ 50 million were paid to senior government officials and to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> coffers. The allegations have never been proved. The report by the auditor general said the arms purchase was flawed on technical considerations and cost assessment. Opposition parties have been using the <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> issue to try to merge and mount a viable challenge to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the general election. But their efforts have stalled in squabbling and widely-publicized power struggles for nearly a year. N.T. <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Telugus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision to resign from parliment proved the opposition could unite on major issues. `` We are committed to give a clean government to the country,'' he said.

 A man with a semiautomatic handgun opened fire at a bus at a busy downtown stop, killing the driver and a rider, then fled by critically wounding a motorist and taking his car. `` The guy just raised his arm and pow, pow, pow!'' said <PERSON> Devin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppy </PERSON>, who was sitting in the rear of the bus when the shooting occurred Sunday afternoon. Police were searching for the gunman and his getaway car today. They said there was no apparent motive for the shootings. `` There is nothing to indicate -LRB- the gunman -RRB- was waiting for somebody. I have no reason to believe he knew his intended victims,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Darron </PERSON> <PERSON> Castiglione </PERSON>. `` He's killed two people and critically wounded one for no apparent reason.'' Witnesses said the unidentified gunman had been drinking wine on a bus stop bench in front of a busy supermarket in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, a suburb north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. After the county bus pulled up and other passengers got on, he opened fire at the driver and then sprayed the bus, police and witnesses said. `` The door opened. He stood up, reached under his shirt and pulled out a gun,'' said Oppy, 28. `` The driver looked at him and he shot him three times in the head. He did n't say a word. People were screaming and jumping on the floor. I kept saying, ` Get down!''' <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Granger </PERSON>, 43, a driver for the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, was pronounced dead at the scene. An immigrant from <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> with several children, he was making his last round and had about 30 minutes left on his shift at the time of the attack. A passenger apparently killed by bullets fired through the windows had not been identified by early today. Neither victim was robbed and they appeared to have been selected at random, police said. After the shootings, the gunman calmly strolled through a supermarket parking lot to a nearby intersection, banged his gun on the window of a car and ordered the driver out, witnesses said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaguda </PERSON>, 31, a tourist from <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, surrendered his car and was walking away when the gunman shot him three times, twice in the back, witnesses said. `` The -LRB- gunman -RRB- seemed like he did n't have a care in the world,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 40, who ran to call police. `` He just lifted his arm and bang, bang, bang.'' <PERSON> Yaguda </PERSON> was taken to Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> where he was listed in critical condition today, a nursing supervisor said. As the gunman drove off, a 16-year-old service station attendant who asked to remain unidentified tried to pursue, but gave up the chase after a few blocks because the man was driving too fast. The gunman was described by witnesses as white and in his 40s with a moustache, dark hair in a pony tail and wearing a red plaid shirt and blue jeans, said Police spokeswoman <PERSON> Joycelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 40, had just stepped off the bus and walked past the gunman when he heard shots and ran inside a nearby store. `` I looked him dead in the face,'' said King. `` He was calm. He did n't look like the type of person who would get up and kill three people. He looked like a regular street person. Fifteen seconds later, he started shooting.''

<TEXT>
 A year after a wealthy woman was abducted after a bridge party, authorities do n't know whether she is alive but they promise surprises when a lawyer goes on trial in connection with her disappearance. <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>, then 72, disappeared from her <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> home on July 26, 1988. Her husband of 49 years, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, reported her missing. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, lawyer, faces federal charges of conspiracy to kidnap, extortion by mail and perjury in connection with Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s disappearance. He is to stand trial Aug. 28 in <LOCATION> Hattiesburg </LOCATION>. The case has been chronicled in newspapers and magazines and featured on the national television programs, `` Unsolved Mysteries,'' and `` Inside Story.'' But <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said in an interview last week that much remains to be told, and some will be revealed during the trial. Court-appointed defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Colette </PERSON> agreed. `` There will be a great deal of surprises,'' he said. The only word from Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> or her abductors has been a vague ransom note left at the scene and a blood-stained note from Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> dated Aug. 10. The ransom note demanded that <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> settle matters with 12 franchisers sued by <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company formerly controlled by <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>. Although the kidnappers never made any specific demands, <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> paid a total of $ 1 million to the 12 franchisers after receiving the note from his wife. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s worth is estimated at between $ 100 million and $ 200 million. <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> was one of the franchisers. He voluntarily returned the money. According to court records, a federal judge had ordered <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> to pay $ 90,000 in June 1983 and $ 153,883 in 1984 to the Jackson-based School Pictures. <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> has said he lost his life's savings,. According to information released so far, <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>'s arrest stemmed from statements by an unnamed woman who says he paid her $ 500 to dye her hair and otherwise disguise herself, travel to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and mail what is believed to be the Aug. 10 note from Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>. The woman has n't been charged, authorities said. Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s family has declined to comment on the anniversary of her disappearance. But <PERSON> Oralee </PERSON> <PERSON> Buie </PERSON>, who played bridge with Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> just hours before her abduction, said the adjustment without her friend of almost 50 years has been trying. `` It's just very discouraging,'' she said. `` There's always hope since we do n't know, but it's hard to hold onto that hope.''

<HEAD>Arafat: PLO Has Had Direct Contact with Israeli Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> says in an interview published today that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has opened direct contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was quoted by the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> daily <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Messaggero </PERSON> as saying a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee met recently in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> with an envoy of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. He did not identify the two officials or give any details of the talks. The Israeli government has repeatedly denied it is carrying out direct or indirect negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it describes as a terrorist organization intent on the destruction of the Jewish state. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was interviewed by <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Messaggero </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, the political headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. He was quoted as saying that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> himself had met with Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories who are tied to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. He showed the interviewer what he described as a written report about a 45-minute meeting on July 12 between <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Palestinians. `` <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> says he's meeting <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives of the occupied territories,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` Secret meetings, he says, against the will of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not true. None of these meetings was held against our will. We approve them from the beginning and after the talks we received complete reports from our cadres.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, has said the prime minister held two meetings with Palestinians from the occupied territories this month. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials refuse to say who the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are, claiming the lives of the dialogue partners would be threatened by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> knows well that there are no Palestinians inside <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> or outside Palestine who do not belong to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` Why is he trying to stage this show? He's trying to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> far away from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration that he's trying to deceive.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s dialogue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not produced any concrete results so far. `` But the decision by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reject the request to block the dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was important,'' he said. `` A very positive sign.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today hanged 22 people convicted of drug smuggling or prostitution, including nine women and four Afghan nationals, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the men were hanged in public squares around <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and the women at a jail outside the capital. It said they were convicted of smuggling, selling and distributing heroin and opium, prostitution and spreading corruption. The hangings brought to 810 the number of officially reported executions under an anti-narcotics law that mandates the death penalty for possession of even small quantities of drugs. The law took effect in January. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said a six-month grace period for addicts to kick the habit expired Sunday and they would be rounded up and sent to labor camps and other rehabilitation centers. Law enforcement officials have said they have identified 80 percent of Iranian drug addicts. Authorities have said that 1 million Iranians are involved in drug abuse but unofficial estimates put the figure at 2 million of the country's 50 million population.

 <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMond </PERSON> tried to become just another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, but he had a hard time going unnoticed at the <LOCATION> Moulin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. Less than six hours earlier on Sunday, he had won the Tour de France, the famed <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> cycling race. He staged a miraculous comeback to win the 2,020-mile, 23-day race by the closest victory margin ever _ eight seconds over <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fignon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. So, it's no surprise he was greeted by applause at the <LOCATION> Moulin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, the famous nightclub. The victory completed a dramatic recovery for <PERSON> LeMond </PERSON> from misfortune suffered after he became the first American to prevail in cycling's most famous race in 1986. In April 1987 he was accidentally shot by his brother-in-law while hunting. Then he had an emergency appendectomy followed by shin surgery. All of which made him miss the Tour in 1987 and 1988. He came back this year with low expectations. `` One month ago, I did n't think I would be in the top 10, top 20,'' <PERSON> LeMond </PERSON> said. `` But through the race I got more confident.'' Confident enough to overcome <PERSON> Fignon </PERSON>'s apparently insurmountable 50-second lead in the final stage, a 15-mile time trial from <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` I went all out,'' <PERSON> LeMond </PERSON> said. `` I did n't think I was going to win.

<HEAD>Six Arrested for Disorderly Conduct on Airliner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 A husband-wife tiff aboard an airliner escalated to a fight among several passengers and led to the arrest of six people from the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` They had a little brawl,'' state police Cpl. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Howley </PERSON> said of the weekend incident aboard an MD-80 jet with 146 passengers aboard. `` It started out as a husband and wife that were sort of running around the plane and making demands on the crew and being a general nuisance and hollering,'' <PERSON> Howley </PERSON> said. Officials available today were unable to say if blows were exchanged on the flight Saturday, but said the husband struggled with police who arrested him in the airport terminal. Facing arraignment today on a variety of charges are <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacks-Wilner </PERSON>, 39, attorney for Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and his wife, <PERSON> Joane </PERSON>, 37.

The others were charged with interfering with a flight crew. The <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> say the fracas aboard the flight took place when the plane was in the air, and forced the pilot to abort the landing Saturday evening. But airline spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> insisted the fight took place on the ground, and that the pilot aborted his first landing attempt because another plane was slow to taxi out of the way. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is investigting, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciccarelli </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Canadian Province Declares State of Emergency to Fight Forest Fires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The provincial government has declared a state of emergency to fight raging forest fires and help house thousands the blazes have left homeless. About 18,000 people have been airlifted from remote Indian reserves and farms in the province, where the fires have swept through nearly 2 million acres of dense evergreen forest. `` Virtually all of northern <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> is on fire and we're just hoping some of our major centers are not going to be affected,'' Emergency Measures Minister <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Driedger </PERSON> said on Sunday. `` Once you get 15 minutes out of <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, all you see is smoke.'' Hot, dry and windy weather fanned the flames of more than 400 fires across northern <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. Lightning is blamed for most blazes, but police believe people started at least two. Weather forecasts preducted thundershowers today, but officials fear that may mean more lightning fires. A change in wind direction today could cause additional problems, the Natural Resources Department said. <PERSON> Driedger </PERSON> declared the state of emergency Sunday night. `` What was needed was the power to get placements -LRB- for evacuees -RRB-, equipment, supplies,'' he said.

 Recovery of five skeletons from a 115-year-old grave in <LOCATION> Deadman </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulch </LOCATION> has given investigators new clues about the deaths of confessed cannibal <PERSON> Alferd </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>'s gold prospecting companions.

On Saturday, they found a bullet hole in a right pelvic bone _ possible support for <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>'s claim that one member of the party killed the other four and that <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> shot that man in self-defense. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> emerged from the mountains in April 1874, but the remains of his companions were n't found and buried until that August. The Packer Project, which includes forensic anthropologists, a forensic pathologist, and an expert on fibers and tool marks on bones, packed the bones up Sunday for detailed laboratory study and reconstruction. They hope their work will determine whether one hatchet was used to kill four of the men and another was used on the fifth. That would support <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>'s story that <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> killed the first four with a hatchet before <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> killed <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> in self-defense, shooting him in the stomach and hitting him on the head with a hatchet.

The plates, which ripped loose as the ship was being brought to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> for repairs, must be removed so the tanker can enter shallow <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Among the plates removed was a slab weighing an estimated 50 tons and measuring 72 feet long and 68 feet across. Another cut Sunday was 30 feet long and 35 feet across, said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Jan Cool. The plates wo n't be salvaged because they are too heavy, Ms. Cool said. Instead, divers allowed them to fall 3,000 feet to the ocean floor, <ORGANIZATION> Cool </ORGANIZATION> said.

The plane's exterior was undamaged, <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON> said, but 12 seats were damaged, and holes were punched in the cabin's overhead compartments. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said the three-hour flight had been uneventful until about 30 minutes out of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He was reading a book, the seat-belt warning lights were n't on, and his seatbelt was unhooked, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. Then, without warning, `` All of a sudden there was this tremendous boom. I flew up and hit the ceiling. I came down in my seat, and about two seconds later, I flew up and hit my head again.'' As he was bouncing around, he said, he looked and saw `` other people were doing it too. Some people's heads broke right through the ceiling panel. It was unbelievable. People were screaming and crying.''

 After getting a taste of being flavor of the month in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, 26-year-old filmmaker <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderbergh </PERSON> is retreating from the bright lights, his bag stuffed with big movie projects. <PERSON> Soderbergh </PERSON>, whose `` Sex, Lies and Videotape'' won the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> this year, has new assignments from <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Thatcher Prepares To Shuffle Cabinet As Gov't Popularity Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> summoned <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers for private interviews today ahead of what aides called changes aimed at halting her Conservative government's slide in popularity. A senior <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a `` freshening'' of the 22-member Cabinet would likely be announced this evening. Apart from the Cabinet changes, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> appeared virtually certain to appoint a new chairman of her <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> following a drubbing by socialists in June 15 elections for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Speculation of an unexpected change increased after Energy Secretary <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> favorite whose political career was interrupted after an extramarital liaison six years ago, arrived today at her 10 Downing St. office. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, who is married, resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 after news broke that his secretary, alleged to be his mistress, was pregnant. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> reappointed him when she won a third successive five-year term in elections in June 1987. Also summoned today were Education Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a moderate in the mainly right-wing Cabinet, who is widely expected to replace the current <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>, and Environment Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, chain-smoking scion of an aristocratic family, was expected to become the new Trade and Industry Secretary, replacing <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a non-career politician who has said he wants to resume his business interests. <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, accused by critics of mishandling the current passage through Parliament of a controversial property tax, is blamed by large sections of the party for increasing the government's current unpopularity. But Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who has the sole power to appoint <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers, has publicly defended him. Changes in about 90 government posts which do not carry Cabinet rank, were expected Tuesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government has trailed the revived socialist opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in public opinion polls for several months. In the latest poll by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, published Sunday in The Observer, a liberal weekly, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> was seven points ahead of the Conservatives with 44 percent support. The remainder was split among minority parties. The 2,000 voters questioned were critical of the government for its handling of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, public transport, the new property tax, proposals to privatize water supply and rising inflation. No margin of error was given for the nationwide poll, conducted Thursday and Friday by telephone. In the European elections, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> garnered 40.1 percent of the vote, compared with the Conservatives' 34.7 percent. Adding to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s problems is a revival of labor union militancy, including a wave of public transportation strikes. Inflation, the cornerstone of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s rigorous economic policies since she won power 10 years ago, is now back among the highest in the Western world at 8.3 percent.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told legislators today that the strikes that have swept the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s major coal fields for nearly two weeks have been the `` biggest test'' of his four years in power. He blamed coal ministry and local officials rather than the miners for the unrest _ which halted work at mines in all the country's major coal fields _ but he said `` deciding such questions by striking will ruin our tasks.'' The Soviet president said most striking miners have returned to work, including at least half the 300,000 miners in the country's biggest coal basin, the 121-mine <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> region in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> `` We are coming out of a very serious crisis, the biggest test during the four years of perestroika,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the Supreme Soviet, referring to his program of restructuring economic and political life. On Sunday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a rare television interview that he was `` inspired'' by the workers' initiative although he disagreed with their tactics. He also said he understood why the miners mistrusted a government that long ignored them. The strikers in the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> basin were among the last holdouts from the nationwide coal strike that started in western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> July 11 and spread to the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The strikes began to ebb Friday as the <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> strikers returned to work Friday after exacting promises of higher pay, better food, clothing and housing and greater control over their industry. The government said those concessions would apply to striking miners nationwide. Strikers in the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> have held out for legal guarantees from the Supreme Soviet that the government would keep the promises it made to miners in a settlement signed Saturday by strike leaders and government officials. A lawmaker from the <LOCATION> Pechora </LOCATION> coal basin in the far north told the Supreme Soviet that miners around the city of <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> also remained on strike, in part due to `` disinformation'' by the media. Miner <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lushnikov </PERSON> said state-run media reported erroneously that the <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> strike ended. According to recent reports, miners remained on strike at 11 of the 13 mines in <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> and at all 12 mines in <LOCATION> Chervonograd </LOCATION> in the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. Lawmakers speaking at today's Supreme Soviet session, which was broadcast nationally with a slight tape delay, said the strikes showed that the country needed more effective unions. `` We have to admit that the trade unions do n't have the workers' faith,'' said Lithuanian deputy <PERSON> Kazimeras </PERSON> <PERSON> Uoka </PERSON> `` We have to give them the right to establish independent trade unions.'' Soviet unions act as adjuncts of the government, handling the distribution of various benefits rather than fighting for workers' rights Several deputies from mining regions also called for moving up local elections from spring to this fall to give voters a chance to oust officials who were insensitive to miners' needs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> responded that decisions on how the local elections are run should be taken in the republics, not in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, even if that means election laws and schedules will vary from place to place. `` Shall we torpedo and limit this?'' he asked. `` We will hardly succeed, commanding from here.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed that instead of waiting for elections, all local councils around the country hold immediate meetings to `` examine the concrete situations in all regions with the aim of activizing the work of our councils everywhere.'' <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Boiko </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> appealed to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> to meet with a delegation of his region's miners to hasten a resolution of its waning strikes. The walkout in the region began on July 15. More than 5,000 strikers continued demonstrating Sunday on the central square in the city of <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION>, 900 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and miners at each pit were deciding for themselves whether to resume work, a strike leader said in a telephone interview. The settlement in the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> included earlier pension eligibility, pay increases and longer vacations. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the Supreme Soviet the strikes dealt a serious blow to the economy, but he reassured his countrymen that `` our perestroika will give results despite the tests we are undergoing.'' The labor unrest is the country's worst in 60 years and would have been unthinkable before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in 1985 and loosened restrictions on civil liberties. At the strikes' peak, reports indicated half the coal industry's 1 million workers were off the job

 <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s wily <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker, is so confident he will be elected the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s fourth president that he is n't even campaigning. `` People do n't expect me to put up posters and photos,'' the 55-year-old cleric was quoted as telling the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Jomhuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islami </ORGANIZATION>. Polls published by some newspapers indicate that when Iranians cast ballots on Friday, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> will win 86 percent of the vote. They give his only challenger, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheibani </PERSON>, a colorless former agriculture minister, a paltry 11 percent. Three percent of Iranians questioned said they would not vote. The media, much of it controlled by the speaker's brother <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s allies, are already speculating about who will be in <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s Cabinet. Little is reported about <PERSON> Sheibani </PERSON>'s campaign. Although he is not stumping, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has kept a high profile through newspaper interviews. He has stressed that his priority is rebuilding <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s sagging economy, slashing inflation, boosting production and creating jobs. The presidential vote, originally scheduled for Aug. 18, was moved up three weeks to accelerate the transition of power following the June 3 death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary patriarch That transition has been smooth so far, despite bitter rivalries within the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hierarchy between <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s so-called pragmatists and radicals led by Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is certain to inherit a more powerful presidency than his predecessor and ally, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who was chosen <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s supreme religious leader following <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death. A national referendum that will be held alongside the presidential vote is expected to win approval for proposed constitutional amendments that will increase the president's powers, making him head of government and scrapping the post of prime minister The reforms will streamline <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s government by eliminating competing power centers that have virtually paralyzed decision-making and delayed the formulation of a sound economic strategy following the cease-fire last August in the 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Analysts say that election of the popular <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> would usher in a new, more liberal era in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which was dominated for the last 10 turbulent years by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and his fundamentalist Islamic ideology. It would probably bring new moves to build bridges with the West. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> have clearly outmaneuvered the radicals, including <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, 43, who was known to have had presidential aspirations but did not throw his turban into the ring. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which supports <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, tipped <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> as <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s successor as speaker in what was a clear hint to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s heir that he would not be left out in the cold if he played ball. Hard-liners will likely be offered positions in the new government, but with diminished powers. Presidential elections in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since the 1979 revolution have always been one-horse races. The first president, <PERSON> Abolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> was elected in January 1980 with 75 percent of the vote, far outstripping his two nearest rivals. <PERSON> Sheibani </PERSON>, 58, a French-trained physician, ran in the July 1981 presidential election _ called when the liberal <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> was forced into exile by <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> hard-liners _ against then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajaie </PERSON> and two other candidates. <PERSON> Rajaie </PERSON> won with a landslide 13 million of the 14.7 million votes cast _ and was assassinated by leftist rivals 37 days later. His successor, <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, won a whopping 95 percent of the 16.8 million votes cast. His three rivals could only muster 5 percent between them. <PERSON> Sheibani </PERSON> has represented a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> district in the 270-seat parliament since April 1984, but has no national political base. He is linked with <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazargan </PERSON>'s small <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s token opposition party He and <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> were the only two of 80 Iranians who applied to contest the presidency to be approved by the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardians </ORGANIZATION>, a constitutional watchdog body. <PERSON> Sheibani </PERSON>'s candidacy looks suspiciously like a token tilt toward democracy so that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> will not be elected unopposed. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s electorate was estimated at around 25 million during last year's parliamentary elections.

 Hundreds of people remained in temporary quarters today as a chemical fire in a derailed tank car burned into its third day, but officials said they found no dangerous levels of toxic chemicals in the area. Residents in a 15-square-mile area around the crash site will be kept from their homes until the fire burns itself out, which was expected sometime today, said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON>, senior manager of news and media relations for <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the train. A team of hazardous material experts checked the fire shortly after dawn and found it reduced greatly, but still burning, <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said. Officials hope later today to begin allowing people to return home. `` After safety, the top priority for <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> and the local officials is as quickly as it is possible, to reduce the size of the evacuated area,'' he said. Even after the fire goes out, the evacuation will remain in effect in the immediate area as hazardous materials experts examine the 14 derailed cars and determine how to handle their contents, <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said. Monitoring around the tank cars found no dangerous levels of toxic chemicals, and no long-term effects to homes or possessions were anticipated, <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said. The burning cars did not threaten other chemical-laden cars in the 32-car train, <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said earlier. Three tank cars burst into flames after Saturday's derailment. One carload of highly flammable naphtha burned up within an hour, sending up a fireball and column of smoke. Two homes were destroyed by the fire, but no serious injuries were reported. A carload of acrylic acid burned itself out Sunday, but the third tanker, containing chlorosilene continued to burn early today. Experts decided the safest way to handle the fire was to let it burn itself out. The chemical is a flammable liquid used in silicon production. It is made by <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and Corning Glass Works. Unofficial estimates on the numbers of evacuees ranged from 400 to 2,000, but the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Tittabawassee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> officials said they'd been too busy to make an accurate count. The <LOCATION> Saginaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> township, located about 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, has a population of 5,000. Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> arrived in <LOCATION> Freeland </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said it would take as long as several weeks for the railroad to determine the cause of the crash. `` Right now, the safety of our workers is the number one priority,'' he said. It was the third derailment involving a <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> train in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> within a year. <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said the company had found no links between the first two derailments and did n't believe there were any problems with the way the company conducts its operations. <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said the train was traveling at about 37 mph when it derailed. He said the section of track where the accident occurred has been inspected once a week, most recently by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> engineers last Tuesday. The three-member train crew also inspected the train before it left <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, he added.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> announced today he will resign after his scandal-plagued party suffered a stinging electoral defeat, losing control of a house of parliament for the first time in its 34 years. `` It was a very difficult election,'' <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> told a nationally televised news conference. Uno has been prime minister less than two months, but he said his party's loss of control of parliament's upper house in Sunday elections ultimately is his responsibility. The long-governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have seen their popularity plummet over an influence-peddling scandal, a new 3 percent sales tax and the liberalization of agricultural imports, which farmers say hurts their livelihood. Uno has been criticized for alleged extramarital affairs, including with a geisha who said he paid her to be his mistress for several months. He said he hoped a successor could be found `` promptly.'' Analysts said the process could take several weeks. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s resignation will result in the dissolution of the Cabinet and restructuring of the governing party's leadership. But some <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> said this would not solve the problems. `` It's a question of why we lost,'' said <PERSON> Yohei </PERSON> <PERSON> Koono </PERSON>, a liberal lower house lawmaker. `` If our choice of policies is wrong, we need to change it.'' Business leaders urged thorough political reforms from the party that guided <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rapid postwar economic growth. `` We should not allow this to have an adverse effect on economic activity or the people's lives,'' said <PERSON> Eishiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Saito </PERSON>, chairman of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>. In the balloting for half the 252 seats in parliament's upper house, the big winner was the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, the first woman leader of a major <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> party. Of 126 seats at stake, the Socialists won 46, the Liberal Democrats 36. The Socialists' total strength in the chamber rose from 43 to 66; the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' fell from 142 to 109. <ORGANIZATION> Rengo </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Confederation -RRB-, a new labor-based group, won 11 seats and the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 10, with the rest split among smaller parties. Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> said her party quickly will call a meeting of opposition leaders to form a coalition against the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who still hold 293 of the 512 seats in parliament's more powerful lower house. Any coalition is expected to be fragile. While most major opposition parties have called for abolishing the new sales tax, they vary broadly on other issues such as defense policy, relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and nuclear power. With the loss of their majority in the upper house, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> will face greater difficulties in passing legislation. The upper chamber can vote down bills and delay, but not block, the budget and treaties. Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> called her party's victory `` the people's verdict,'' and said <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s decision to step down was `` only natural.'' She said the Socialists' first priority is to pass a bill in the upper house abolishing the sales tax. Such a bill is unlikely to be approved by the lower house, however, and a standstill over the issue could add to pressure for early elections for the lower chamber. Legally, they do not have to be held for 12 months. A loss in the lower house would threaten the governing party's 34-year hold on power since that chamber chooses the prime minister About 65 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 90.3 million eligible voters cast ballots in Sunday's election, reflecting strong feelings over issues affecting many people's everyday lives. Women were particularly unhappy over the new sales tax, bulldozed through by the governing party despite an opposition boycott. `` I really believe that this was a people's revolution coming from the kitchen,'' said <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinsaka </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rengo </ORGANIZATION> candidate who won election in <LOCATION> Nara </LOCATION>. A record 146 women candidates ran for office Sunday, and a record 22 were elected, more than doubling female representation in the chamber. `` One result of the election is that Japanese politicians from now on will have to pay more attention to women,'' said <PERSON> Seisaburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Though Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> is immensely popular, her party has been widely accused of lacking a realistic and constructive platform. In the past, it has called for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to disband its Self-Defense Forces and scrap the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>, under which 64,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are stationed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Socialist leaders now say they would not immediately do away with the armed forces and seek only to revise the treaty. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> became prime minister June 2 after former Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resigned to take responsibility for a scandal in which the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a publishing conglomerate, allegedly distributed millions of dollars in underpriced stocks and political donations to obtain favors. The governing party spent weeks finding an unsullied successor for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. But shortly after taking office, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was linked to the sex scandal. Asked how he felt after announcing his resignation, Uno, a poet, said, `` My state of mind is ` meikyo shisui''' _ meaning tranquil as unrippled water.

 Kids got in free on the first night of <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>'s Tour for All Generations but their parents were doing the screaming for the former Beatle, a grandfather backed by a graying constellation of rock stars. They included former Beatles collaborator <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, who played the organ on `` Let it Be;'' spooky Bayou singer Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON>; saxman <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> and guitarist-keyboardist <PERSON> Nils </PERSON> <PERSON> Lofgren </PERSON>, on loan from <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s E-Street Band; and volume-cranking guitarist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a former Eagle. <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> opened the first show of his 30-city tour stage front and center Sunday night, singing `` It Do n't Come Easy.'' After his third vocal on `` Yellow Submarine,'' the 49-year-old retired to the rhythm section. Banging the drums rapidly along with <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> were <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Keltner </PERSON>, who played for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> on their solo efforts, and <PERSON> Levon </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>, drummer for The Band. Fellow Band member <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> provided the bass line.

The concert's promoters boosted the family theme by giving free admission to children 12 and under accompanied by adults. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> was wearing a star-trimmed jacket in his first public appearance since a 1986 guest role with the <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Students Demand Release of Burmese Opposition Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 60 Burmese students waved banners and chanted slogans outside their country's embassy in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> today to demand that <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> release two arrested leaders of the top opposition group. It has been difficult to determine what is happening in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> because telephone and telex lines have been cut most of the time since Wednesday, when hundreds of students defied martial law with anti-government protests. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s official radio reported 44 arrests during those protests in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, the capital. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> believe <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> authorities are trying to limit foreign reporting on their domestic strife. The military government of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> placed <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and Tin Oo, who lead the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, under house arrest on Thursday. The two were accused of trying to `` destroy the military and revive anarchy,'' even though Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> had canceled a major rally planned for Wednesday. In addition, British authorities have expressed concern over the whereabouts of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Aris </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>'s British husband. He flew to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, on Saturday. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Aris </PERSON> was not permitted to see a British diplomat who had waited for him at the airport. Aris may also be under house arrest, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. In the <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> protest, <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> students carried banners denouncing military rule and waved a `` fighting peacock'' flag while chanting slogans of last year's thwarted popular Burmese uprising for democracy. The fighting peacock was the symbol of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s battle for independence from British colonial rule. `` We denounce the arrests and demand the immediate release of <LOCATION> Aung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Suu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kyi </LOCATION> and Tin Oo,'' said 24-year-old <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Thee </PERSON> <PERSON> Zun </PERSON>, who until April headed the largest student party in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. He fled after a wave of arrests of opposition activists. Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in September and his troops crushed dissent by killing hundreds of people. Millions of people protested nationwide last year to demand an end to a quarter century of military control of the government. `` The more oppressive the government becomes, the more turmoil it will cause, and it may lead to a civil war in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Htun </PERSON> <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyaw </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The group is a Burmese dissident organization operating on the Thai border.

<HEAD>DC-9 Makes Emergency Landing; No One Hurt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATERLOO, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 with 27 people aboard made an emergency landing early today with no traffic controllers in the airport tower and with its primary electrical system down. No one was injured. It was the second jetliner forced to make an emergency landing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in less than a week. The pilot switched to his backup electrical system and the jetliner, en route from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, landed safely, an American spokesman said. Police and fire units were standing by at the <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Municipal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, but were not needed. The plane, Flight 639, landed just after midnight, said <PERSON> Hagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, area supervisor for the <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> tower. <PERSON> Hagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> tower is staffed only until 11 p.m. and no air traffic controllers were on duty at the time of the landing. He said regional controllers handled the emergency landing. On Wednesday, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 lost power over northwest <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and crashed while attempting an emergency landing at the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> airport, killing 110 people. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said the backup system allows the plane's electrical systems to function normally. The electrical system does not affect the aircraft's steering mechanism, which are controlled by hydraulic lines, he said There were hydraulic problems in the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> landing. `` Once he had a problem, the pilot immediately goes to air traffic control and declares an emergency,'' <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON> said. `` At that point, they direct him to the nearest airport.'' The backup system kicked in immediately after the primary system failed, <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON> said. Because the pilot did not have a second backup system, he chose to land the plane. `` It's a precautionary move,'' <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON> said. `` You do n't want to be flying without a backup.''

 A woman who was jailed for six days for refusing to testify against a man charged with raping her says she's angrier at the legal system than at her alleged attacker. The 22-year-old woman _ who said she ignored court summonses because she did n't want to relive the assault _ said her arrest at first seemed like a second kidnapping and she was frightened when her lawyer could n't seem to get her freed. `` I thought I was never getting out,'' the woman told the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> in an interview from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that was published over the weekend. `` It was like, ` I ca n't believe this is happening to me,''' she said. `` ... I'm just very angry, more at the system than at my attacker.'' The woman was jailed June 15 after <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Speiser </PERSON> ordered her arrested and brought to court so he could ask her if she was willing to testify against <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, 26, an unemployed mechanic. Lord is charged with armed sexual battery and armed kidnapping in an assault on the woman, who was kidnapped from a restaurant parking lot and assaulted Nov. 6. When the woman finally was brought into court June 20, the judge scolded her. `` It disturbs me that, since you are the victim of this crime, that you have totally ignored your obligation to appear in court and appear for depositions,'' <PERSON> Speiser </PERSON> said. She was freed that day after agreeing to testify at the trial, which is scheduled to begin Aug. 21. The judge said he did n't intend that the woman be jailed. Deputies who arrested her were supposed to bring her straight to court, he said. `` I had no idea when they picked her up,'' <PERSON> Speiser </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> last week. `` Why they did n't bring her to me, I do n't know.'' But those were n't the orders jailers got from the judge, said Maj. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a jail director. He read from a computer print-out of directions to jailers: `` Subject is to be remanded into custody of <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> until she can be brought before Judge <PERSON> Speiser </PERSON> _ no bond.''

<TEXT>
 About 40 Zairean students padlocked the gates of their embassy today and blocked staff from entering to protest their government's failure to provide living subsidies and plane tickets home. The students have staged a sit-in on embassy grounds for a week, but said officials have offered no solution. Today, they padlocked the embassy gates and barricaded them with tables, leaving Chinese staff standing bewildered outside. One student said <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s military attache drove up in a car but the students refused to let him in. <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitufuila </PERSON>, 26, who recently graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traditional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, said his government agreed to give students in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> about $ 90 for monthly living expenses. `` It has n't paid in 23 months,'' he said, speaking through the compound's iron gates. <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> now has 89 students in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, most pursuing undergraduate degrees in the sciences. They have been living on about $ 67 a month paid by the Chinese government, but many also have borrowed from their schools and are under pressure to repay the debts, the students said. <PERSON> Bitufuila </PERSON> and other recent graduates said their government also has failed to provide plane tickets home. `` The agreement is that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> pays the tickets out and our government pays them back,'' he said. Ambassador <PERSON> Lombo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomangamanga </PERSON>, who met with students Saturday, refused to comment. `` We have written letters for a long time now, not only to him but to -LRB- the government in -RRB- <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, and there is no answer,'' said <PERSON> Manu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapapa </PERSON>, 29, who just graduated from <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Zairean students in other countries also complain they have not received stipends. The Zaireans are one of the largest groups out of 1,500 Africans studying under Chinese scholarships this year. Their presence has triggered racial conflicts in the past as in December, when African and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students clashed in the eastern city of <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION> after Africans brought <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> women to a school dance. Before the week of clashes ended, thousands of Chinese marched through the streets shouting, `` Kill the black devils.'' <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> sent its 18 students home, but students from <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> complained their governments would not let them leave.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, defending the half-billion-dollar B-2 Stealth bomber and saying the Star Wars missile defense system is critical, appealed today to senators to keep his defense budget intact. The president, meeting with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and other leading senators, also said an espionage investigation at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does n't help U.S.-Soviet relations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the B-2 and the Strategic Defense Initiative, both of which are threatened with deep cuts on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, are essential to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense and to arms talks with the Soviets. `` I strongly support what we sent up there to the <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. SDI, in my view, is critical,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The B-2, he added, `` is a revolutionary plane with revolutionary technology. Again I would strongly urge your support for that.'' He also appealed for support for funds for the Midgetman missile and for making the MX missile mobile. `` We need the utmost flexibility in terms of arms control,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Asked by reporters how he could justify the expense of the B-2, costing $ 70 billion for 132 planes, or $ 530 million apiece, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` I justify it because I think the prime responsibility of the president is the national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Asked about the investigation of top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> as a possible <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> spy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it `` is a very serious matter and it will be thoroughly investigated.'' `` The minute I heard about it I was aggrieved because it is a very tragic thing should these allegations be true,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Asked what impact it might have on U.S.-Soviet relations, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` It does n't help any. ... Espionage goes on. I do n't think it helps when you have high-visibility cases. but I think regrettably it says more, if it's true, about an individual who is alleged to have passed secrets to the Soviets, which is very bad.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was not sure how seriously <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security may have been compromised. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was the No. 2 official at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. On Sunday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget chief said the president has ruled out any suggestion from Democrats that he accept future tax increases in exchange for an immediate cut in the capital gains tax. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, kicking off the week with an unusually hectic schedule, also planned to meet with South Korean Foreign Minister <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Joong </PERSON>. Another White House visitor was <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, son and namesake of the city's legendary mayor. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been negotiating with House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., the Ways and Means chairman, on a revenue package White House budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said Sunday, `` We believe that right now, we have the votes for a satisfactory capital gains proposal in the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Our only problem is ... -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and committee Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> -RRB- wo n't actually bring it up for a vote.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said the president was not willing to agree to exchange a lower capital gains levy now for increases in other taxes next year or later. `` The president is firmly committed to his pledge not to raise taxes,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation.'' Asked how long <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intended to stick by his no-tax-increase pledge, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said, `` For the time being, let's assume forever _ but I do n't know exactly what that means.'' The Democratic leaders contend lowering the capital gains rate _ now 28 to 33 percent _ would hurt the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and help only the wealthy. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said it would stimulate growth and raise <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> revenues.

 It's not exactly <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION>, but a new jail and its robot food carts have become so popular with families that a baffled sheriff decided to schedule more tours this week. `` We've had people with cameras and video cameras. It's amazing to me,'' said Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who organized the tours of the state-of-the - art facility The $ 174 million <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail, about 25 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, will be the sixth-largest county jail in the nation when it opens in September. <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> and his deputies were amazed when more than 6,000 people showed up for free tours offered during two weeks last month. About 2,500 showed up for the first Saturday tour _ more than the number who tour the former federal prison on <LOCATION> Alcatraz </LOCATION> on an average day. `` It may be a little like why people like to watch horror movies. It's the unknown,'' said Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON>. Most of the visitors are families with children, senior groups and scout troops. The new jail's biggest draw is its high-tech robot carts, which will deliver food and linens throughout the compound. `` That's what we wanted to see, the little robots running around,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparano </PERSON>, 17. `` What's really amazing is that the prisoners deserve so much. I figured it would be like old jail bars and cells. It looks like a hotel.''

 Newly released court documents show that an expelled Danish woman was suspected of planning an attack in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but she has denied the charges and her lawyer was quoted today as saying she would sue <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Authorities expelled 25-year-old <PERSON> Ulla </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyngsby </PERSON> on July 14. She had been questioned for 90 minutes upon her arrival in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on July 6 and arrested two days later in the northern city of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. Details of the case were censorsed until Sunday, when a <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> court released a document from her bail hearing on July 10 in response to a request from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> journalists. The document included charges she was linked to <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> 17, a military arm of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. It said she planned to carry out attacks on Israeli nationals. The document said the accusation was contained in material provided by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents who investigated her. Her boyfriend, <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishlawi </PERSON>, a Palestinian refugee from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was identified as the deputy chief of <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> 17 in the documents. The Maariv daily newspaper said Ms. <PERSON> Lyngsby </PERSON> was sent by <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> 17 to carry out a massacre at the closing ceremony of the Maccabiah Games for Jewish athletes on July 13. The story said she also intended to assassinate the chief rabbi of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. He was to attend the ceremony at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Wailing Wall, Judaism's holiest site. The charges reported by the paper did not appear in the court documents released Sunday. Police said they could not comment because the <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> secret police had conducted the investigation. In the confession, Ms. <PERSON> Lyngsby </PERSON> admitted helping to obtain travel itineraries of the chief rabbi and newspaper editor <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pundik </PERSON> for suspected attacks when they visited <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Berlingske </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tidende </ORGANIZATION> quoted Ms. <PERSON> Lyngsby </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Joergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, as saying she will sue <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities for a `` symbolic'' sum of $ 4,730. Following her expulsion, she claimed she signed the confession under duress in an effort to win her release. She said it was written in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION>, a language she does not understand. The newspaper quoted her lawyer as saying she was never informed of the charges against her. Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> said Friday that authorities `` knew with certainty'' that a group of people in that country were involved in assassination plans against Danish citizens connected with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He gave no specifics. He said no Danish charges would be pressed against Ms. <PERSON> Lyngsby </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said it found no reason to protest her arrest or expulsion. The daily Politiken in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> quoted the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in that city as saying Force 17 had never been involved in terrorism. The group said it had no knowledge of any plot to kill the chief rabbi or other Danish Jews.

 Shrimpers who ended their blockade of ship channels along the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast say they will renew their protest if officials do n't address their concerns about costly new devices meant to protect sea turtles. The shrimpers lifted anchors and yielded to traffic in the ship channels Sunday, but hundreds waited nearby today as their representatives prepared for a requested meeting with national fisheries officials. `` If something is not done, there'll be shrimpers in all of these channels and there'll probably be violence,'' <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON>, a shrimper from <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said Sunday. `` The tempers are running very high out there.'' About 200 shrimp boats on Saturday crowded the deep-water <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> ship channel, which passes between <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, and about 300 shrimpers jammed <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aransas </LOCATION>, gateway to the Port of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. Similar blockades in smaller <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> ports also ended Sunday. Two recreational boaters were hospitalized briefly for minor injuries after trying to run the blockade Saturday in <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. Gunfire was reported in both states and four shrimpers were arrested in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. There were no injuries, officials said. Coast Guard Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlin </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> 8th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, met with shrimpers' representatives Sunday. A meeting between shrimpers, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials, representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled for this afternoon. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> agreed to a meeting with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> congressional leaders in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman could not be reached. Shrimpers were protesting new <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulations requiring that they use devices intended to protect endangered <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> sea turtles. The devices are designed to allow the turtles to escape shrimpers' nets, but the shrimpers complain that they let shrimp out too and are bulky, dangerous and expensive to operate. The devices cost from $ 60 to several hundred dollars. Tee <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mialjevich </PERSON>, president of the Concerned Shrimpers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said he would propose an alternative requirement that shrimpers perform tows no longer than 90 minutes. He said that by checking nets more often, they could avoid killing turtles and not lose shrimp. He and other shrimpers warned that the blockades would return by Tuesday if their concerns are not addressed. Many of the shrimpers went ashore for a symbolic burning of the turtle protection devices. They vowed not to use them despite potential fines of $ 8,000 to $ 25,000 and six months in jail. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said more than 50 ships were unable to pass through <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> channels during the weekend because of the protests. The Galveston-Bolivar ferry also was halted for several hours Saturday.

<HEAD>Radio Station Seized in Coup Claim, But Government Asserts Control</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Six armed men took over a state-run radio station today and announced the government's overthrow, but authorities quickly denied that a coup had occurred and asserted they were in control Apart from the seizure of the radio station, there were no reports of violence. No injuries were reported at the station. In <LOCATION> Antananarivo </LOCATION>, the capital of this island off <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, people went about their business as usual. The nation has about 10 million people. The armed men took over the station of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> national radio early today and broadcast a statement claiming the government of President <PERSON> Didier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON> had been replaced. It said the country was now being ruled by a group of opposition political leaders. <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, attending a summit of the Organization of African Unity. It was not immediately possible to determine if he intended to remain there. Two hours after the men seized the station, Information Minister <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> broadcast a government message on national radio. He denied that a coup had taken place and called for calm. That message, which was broadcast several times during the morning, said an investigation was under way but provided no other details. A later newscast said one of the armed men had been identified, but that the other men had worn masks. It was not immediately known if the men had been arrested. In April, three people died and about 73 were injured in clashes with police after <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON>'s re-election. Opposition leaders said the elections were riddled with fraud and called for the formation of a provisional government. They said it should include representatives of the military, students and churches and should yield power after new elections. <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON>, initially chosen to rule by the military in 1975, was re-elected to a third seven-year term on March 12 with about 62 percent of the vote.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has no current plans to prosecute a former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official criticized for awarding millions of dollars in subsidies to developers who had contributed to a charity he helped found, a congressman disclosed today. `` Should you come to obtain information not contained in your report implicating Mr. -LRB- Thomas -RRB- <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> or other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials in possible criminal violations we would be happy to review that information,'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, chief of the department's public integrity section, said in a letter to agency officials. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., released the letter as a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee resumed hearings into mismanagement and influence-peddling at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration He also charged that many witnesses during the hearings appeared to have committed perjury and that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should conduct its own investigations instead of relying on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to refer cases for investigation. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> did not name the witnesses to whom he was referring. In the letter, dated July 19, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> it would not prosecute former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> in connection with an inspector general's report criticizing the selection process <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> used to award rent subsidies to developers who promised to renovate housing for low-income people. In the inspector general's report, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and his investigators said many of the developers who received subsidies had been major contributors to FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a Michigan-based charity that <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> helped establish. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> did not criticize the department's decision on <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> but complained <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials had indicated they would not conduct their own investigations into the emerging <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandals. The first witness at today's hearing was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was criticized by committee members but defended his use of his <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> stationery in letters to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials lobbying for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> projects. `` I find nothing wrong with letting people know who I am,'' said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. He said his lobbying business included numerous HUD-related clients. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that federal housing officials approved more than $ 16 million in rent subsidies for a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> housing project after <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>, the wealthy <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> brewer and a friend of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, wrote a letter endorsing the project. The committee also was scheduled to hear testimony from <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a former career <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employee, about her dealings with her friend, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, former executive assistant to then-Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in 1982, was an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a lender which has been indefinitely suspended from doing business with the department because of a high incidence of loan defaults. Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the panel is seeking to use other witnesses to find out about the role of Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, who has refused to testify based on her constitutional right against self-incrimination `` Miss <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> has chosen to take the Fifth Amendment, and we very much hope that she will change her mind,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said in an interview. `` So we will attempt to ascertain through these other witnesses to what extent she was calling the shots and to what extent it was Secretary <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> himself has said that he was not involved in many of the day-to-day decisions at the department and testified that he did not personally order funding for any project. However, those statements were contradicted by a later witness, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> McVay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> is to appear before the panel again in August and September. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> has said the panel is not considering granting legal immunity for Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> under which her testimony could not be used against her in any future prosecution. A number of witnesses before the subcommittee have said that Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s support for a project was crucial in any attempt to get money from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. Big-name Republicans, such as former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, or former high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees used their contacts to obtain the funding. The Times report said <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>' endorsement two years ago came as the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> request appeared headed for rejection. The paper based its report on internal government documents. It also quoted <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> as saying a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> selection committee was told that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> wanted the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> application given `` very careful consideration, which it was.'' Documents showed the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> proposal was originally left off a list of 1987 applications to be recommended for financing, the Times said. On Aug. 12, 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> wrote <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> urging him to `` look into this matter and give it your favorable approval.'' One week after the letter was written, the selection panel met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and approved the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> request, the Times said documents showed. The Times said there was no indication that <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> had a financial interest in the project, characterizing his support for it instead as being motivated by civic pride.

<HEAD>Abkhazia Unrest Spills into Soviet Georgian Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ethnic unrest in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> spilled into the republic's capital today, with hundreds of protesters marching through the streets and bus traffic disrupted, according to witnesses and official reports. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the national legislature the unrest in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> enclave of <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> spread to <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, causing `` the disorganization of transportation'' this morning, apparently because of a strike. The Soviet president said `` the situation became acute'' in the city in the <LOCATION> Caucusus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> mountains </LOCATION>, about 1,050 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The protest follows clashes between Georgians and Abkhazians in the Georgia-ruled enclave of <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>, a popular seaside vacation area about 170 miles west of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>. Since the violence began July 15, 19 people have been reported killed and more than 400 injured. An editorial assistant at the Georgian news agency <ORGANIZATION> Gruzinform </ORGANIZATION> said buses failed to appear in some areas of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> this morning but were running by midday. The interruption of bus service appeared linked to a railway strike that began over the weekend and ended today, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The walkout stranded thousands of tourists. Besides the transit strike, several hundred people demonstrated throughout the day in central <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> `` against what happened in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>,'' the editor, <PERSON> Nana </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelashvili </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview. `` When those Abkhazians started to knife Georgians, it just drove us out of our minds,'' she said. No armed clashes have been reported in the area for the past two days, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported, although internal security troops and police continued to confiscate weapons from extremists. Activists in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> proposed a general strike for today to protest what they called a failure by authorities to protect Georgians in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>. As a result of the violence, two regional party secretaries were fired and two government leaders in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> lost their jobs Saturday. Abkhazians and Georgians blame each other for the ethnic unrest. Abkhazians, who are a minority in their own region, want greater economic independence and cultural rights, while Georgians want the fertile enclave retained as part of their <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republic. <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> leaders want to develop a dialogue over problems in the region, but Abkhazians want the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to establish an outside body to take control, news reports say. Protesters today called for resolution of the question of <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>'s status and an end to the violence, <PERSON> Gelashvili </PERSON> said. At least 132 people have died in ethnic unrest during the past month in the southern Soviet republics of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 crash claimed its 106th victim today, while investigators using infrared cameras searched cornfields 60 miles from the crash site for pieces of the plane's rear engine. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Bealer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Quakertown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, died early today from injuries he suffered in Wednesday's crash, said <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostrihonsky </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Thirty-two others remain hospitalized and five people are still listed as missing. At <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, officials on Sunday were painstakingly reassembling the tail section of Flight 232 in hopes of determining what caused the jet to lose hydraulic power and tumble out of control across the runway. In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> official told about 200 people at a service for survivors and victims that it was time for healing after Wednesday's crash. `` There is little to say to ease the sadness. We at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> feel deeply your pain and loss. We have lost members of the United family. And we offer thanks for those who were spared,'' said Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Traub </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of flight standards in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Authorities were beginning to return home the bodies of crash victims. A spokesman for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said more than 20 bodies had been sent home by Sunday. According to a list compiled with information from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, relatives and employers, 106 people were confirmed dead and five were still listed as missing. Another 185 passengers survived the crash, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said farmers in a 16-square-mile section about 60 miles northeast of the crash site were being asked to look for parts, including the missing engine fan. <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> jets photographed those fields with infrared cameras in a search for metal fragments thrown from the engine when it exploded. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said the search had been hampered because some pieces apparently fell in areas where corn is up to 6 feet high. `` We basically plan on being alert. We're concerned about our machines getting a flat tire and so forth,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, on whose farm several pieces of the plane fell. In a separate development, <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said he would ask the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> to look at the issue of child safety in aviation accidents, including whether special child safety seats should be used on airplanes, according to today's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. If child safety seats are required, infants who now sit on laps and fly free would need their own seats, which could make family travel more expensive. An unusually large number of children were aboard the flight in part because airlines offer free tickets to children flying with adults on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. At least one infant died in the crash, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said. A list compiled by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> shows 24 children under 10 years old, including seven under 5, were among the survivors. Investigators continued to interview crew members, meanwhile. The flight engineer said that immediately after the explosion in the No. 2 engine, the gauges indicated the immediate loss of fluid in all three hydraulic systems, according to <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. Without the hydraulic systems, the DC-10 is almost impossible to fly. Investigators also said they checked maintenance records on key sections of the engine. `` There's nothing here that gives us cause for concern at this point,'' said <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. `` Although I will say that previous accidents have led to reductions in cycles. So it's not to say that this is irrelevant.'' The age of engine parts is expressed in cycles, or one landing and takeoff. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials said they hoped to end their on-site investigation by midweek. Other investigators gathered personal items of passengers, stowing them in a hangar to be claimed later. `` We are taking great pains to collect everything we can, identify them and return them,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON>. He said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> would assign specially trained workers and give personal phone numbers to families of those who died. Doctors said they were working to stabilize crash victims and allow them to move close to their homes. `` We're moving them home as soon as they're physically capable of the trip,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, head of the burn unit at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Full recovery would take much time for some, he said. While most burn victims departed this northwestern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> city as soon as they were able, some stayed put. `` I could leave tomorrow if I wanted to,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a burn victim from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` I really do n't feel like traveling for a while.''

<HEAD>Israel Court Says Government Must Recognize Jewish Conversions</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 4 grafs of comment from U.S. groups.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that the government must recognize Jewish conversions conducted abroad by <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> rabbis, deciding an issue that has put many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews at odds with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The 4-1 decision immediately caused friction in Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s Cabinet, where religious parties protested and one faction threatened to resign. In a second decision, the court unanimously rejected an appeal to allow Reform rabbis to perform marriages in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. That decision upheld an Orthodox monopoly on conducting religious weddings. Both of today's rulings were linked to the issue of `` Who is a Jew?'' Israeli Orthodox Jews have sought to narrow that definition under the Law of Return. The law now permits granting Israeli citizenship to anyone born of a Jewish mother or who has converted to Judaism and does not belong to another faith. The Orthodox want the definition to include only Jews born to Jewish mothers or converted according to Jewish law known as Halacha, which would effectively mean by Orthodox rabbis. The change has been fought by Conservative and Reform rabbis, whose followers constitute a majority of more than 5 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews but who have few adherents in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Reform and Conservative Jews contend the Orthodox proposal would symbolically excommunicate them from Judaism and alienate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Rabbis estimate there are more than 10,000 conversions a year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, nearly all non-Orthodox. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, headed by Chief Justice <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamgar </PERSON>, made today's decision in a ruling on appeals by 12 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigrants and one from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. They were denied Israeli citizenship papers by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by the ultra-Orthodox <ORGANIZATION> Shas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The court's 17-page ruling said a 1965 Israeli law did not entitle the government to decide the validity of conversions by different Jewish groups. Religious Affairs Minister <PERSON> Zevulun </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> reacted to the ruling by pledging to renew a political campaign for a narrower definition of who is a Jew, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Porush </PERSON>, a legislator of the ultra-Orthodox Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> faction, said his party may withdraw its support from <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s Cabinet. Such a move could sway other religious parties to take similar actions. `` We have a secular court interfering in a religious subject. We must view this very seriously,'' <PERSON> Porush </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Agudat is participating in the government for the first time. It has traditionally refused to do so to avoid dealing in secular affairs. The party holds five seats in the 120-seat Parliament. Its executive council scheduled a meeting for later today to discuss the issue. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Moskowitz </PERSON>, one of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigrants in the court case, said: `` I have been waiting for this for 2 -LCB- years. That's a long time to not know where you stand. Now I know where I stand: on my own feet and I'm Jewish.'' `` I believe it is important to separate the issue of church and state,'' said <PERSON> Elissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Rafael </PERSON>, a plaintiff from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. She joined the suit even though she was converted by an Orthodox rabbi. The marriage ruling came on appeals made seven years ago by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rabbi <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotem </PERSON>; and a rabbi from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemer </PERSON>. In the 97-page decision, the justices upheld three laws which effectively give <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Orthodox rabbis exclusive rights to decide who may preside at marriages. Spokesman for several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> groups said they were pleased by the decision on conversions. `` We believe that the court's action helps to preserve the unity of the Jewish people so essential to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> at the present critical time,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruen </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> affairs for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish Committee in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I say hallelujah,'' said <PERSON> Carmela </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalmanson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION>, a women's Zionist organization in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with 385,000 members. Ms. <PERSON> Kalmanson </PERSON> said that though the numbers of people affected `` may be small, it was the perception that was very hurtful.''

 <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, whose novel `` The Satanic Verses'' caused worldwide uproar among Moslems, remains under strict security and spends only a few weeks in the same house, it was reported Monday. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his American wife, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, have lived in a succession of `` safe houses'' since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s late religious leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, called on Feb. 14 for the author's death for insulting `` Islamic sanctity,'' The Independent reported The report said the houses are operated by the Special Branch _ a unit of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> police headquarters concerned with political activities _ and MI5, the secret intelligence unit. The houses are generally used for spies and intelligence contacts, the newspaper said. On the day of the death threat, the novelist and his wife were taken from their home in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Islington </LOCATION> district by Special Branch detectives and have never gone back there together, it said. `` Salman is effectively in prison at the moment,'' it quoted playwright <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinter </PERSON>, a friend of the novelist, as saying. The report said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his wife have dined with literary acquaintances and leading political figures, such as opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> continues to review books and is writing a children's book. But publishers <PERSON> Secker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warburg </PERSON> requested no use of photographs of Ms. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> when they sent out review copies of her book of short stories, `` Herself in Love,'' to be published this month. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his wife `` are now more alone than ever. Literally no friends, acquaintances, agents or publishers know where they are. They can not receive telephone calls, though mail sent through a tortuous route via police does reach them and they can then respond to messages. But it is a slow process,'' the newspaper said. Security for them costs hundreds of thousands of dollars and `` differs little from that accorded to a head of state ... Activities like shopping, theater or cinema are out of the question,'' the report said. Ms. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> had to cancel a planned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour to publicize her novel, `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dollar </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Aquino Admits Filipinos Still Poor; Teachers Demand Pay Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By YASMIN ARQUIZA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told legislators Monday that most Filipinos remain poor despite economic gains during her three-year rule. In an address to a joint session of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> repeated promises to rid her government of tax cheaters and grafters, and to purge the police and military of criminals who made the crime situation `` nothing less than terrible.'' As she spoke, about 3,000 members of left-wing organizations marched to protest corruption and alleged foreign control of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government and economic policies. Another group of about 3,000 public school teachers demonstrated separately to demand salary increases. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said that despite a 20-year communist insurgency and at least six coup attempts, her government succeeded in the past three years in reviving the economy, increasing investment, reducing unemployment and nibbling away at mass poverty. But the recovery `` has restored old fortunes far more significantly than it has touched the lives of the vast majority'' of more than 55 million Filipinos, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. `` Poverty has lessened but 5.3 million households, or 29 million people, remain poor,'' she said. `` Unemployment has been reduced, but try telling that to the 2.9 million still jobless and the 7.2 million underemployed.'' Even the 500,000 families which statistically have crossed the poverty line _ a monthly income of $ 119 for a family of six _ feel nothing has changed, she said. `` I ca n't blame them: liberty is a poor substitute for food.'' She announced measures to help develop the countryside, where most Filipinos live. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she is `` tired of being taken to task'' for continuing corruption and wants to leave clean and honest government as her legacy. `` To my fellow workers in government specifically involved in this area and in all other areas as well, let me say that unless the public sees results soon, it will be good-bye for you,'' she said. `` The compassion that marked my administration in the past may generate doubts about my resolve in this matter, but the actions that will be taken by me in the next weeks and months will dispel them all.''

 The Army's <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said today it is investigating the cause of a helicopter crash that killed six soldiers in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert during training exercises. `` It will take three to four months for the investigation,'' Col. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanks </PERSON>, a spokesman for the safety center at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rucker </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview. The UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter went down about 4 a.m. Saturday during a mission 14 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Irwin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Three officers and three non-commissioned officers died in the crash A corporal suffered a broken leg, the Pentagon said. All the soldiers involved were from the 1st Cavalry Division based in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. They were at the 1,000-square-mile base 120 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for a three-week training exercise that ended Saturday. Blanks said the crash was the fourth by a UH-60 since October. There were five such accidents last fiscal year, he said, adding: `` There is no abnormal trend, not when you consider the amount of hours they fly.'' The colonel said no repeated structural flaws have been found. `` The majority of our accidents are human error,'' he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, those killed in the crash were identified as Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittingstall </PERSON>, 40, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; Capt. <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, 33, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; 1st Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 26, <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; Chief Warrant Officer 4 <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westbrook </PERSON>, 42, <LOCATION> Poteet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; Chief Warrant Officer 3 <PERSON> Adelbert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, 41, <LOCATION> Hemat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; and Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 28, <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Emilia-Romagna </LOCATION> region on Monday approved $ 17 million in emergency funds to help clean up its algae-infested coastal waters. The money will be used to aid the region's tourism and fishing industries, devastated by the algae which first appeared in early July. The government recently approved $ 100 million in emergency aid for the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> but has yet to implement any measures. The algae that has spread along beaches in the <LOCATION> Friuli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Veneto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marche </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Emilia-Romagna </LOCATION> regions is moving to the south, news reports said Monday. Officials in the <LOCATION> Abruzzo </LOCATION> region said the algae spoiled several beaches over the weekend and hotel operators fear the same tourist flight that has hurt the resort industry in the north. On Sunday, 300 fishing boats tried to increase the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION>'s oxygen supply by cruising back and forth to churn up the water Despite this effort, fish, crustaceans and mollusks have died from lack of oxygen caused by the algae. Affected are areas of the northern <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pescara </LOCATION>.

 A man wanted in a fatal shooting in an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> flower shop and suspected in five more killings in three other states was arrested at a hospital emergency room. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, 37, was arrested Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Comanche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, where he had gone for treatment of a back injury. He was held today in an <LOCATION> Ardmore </LOCATION> jail. District Attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said one count of first-degree murder, two counts of shooting with intent to kill and two counts of robbery with a firearm were filed against <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> in the shootings of three women in a flower shop in <LOCATION> Ardmore </LOCATION>, about 100 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lawton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> also is a suspect in the killing of a photo processing shop owner in <LOCATION> Pampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and the killings of two convenience store clerks in <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Carter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>. `` There is physical evidence linking all of the murders,'' said police Capt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rardin </PERSON> of Garden City. `` I ca n't say much more than that, but the evidence points that way.'' Capt. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojdylak </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said this morning, however, that officers were en route to <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, to question a suspect in a shooting there. <LOCATION> Ardmore </LOCATION> detectives also were en route to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has never really formally said the suspect in custody -LRB- in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> -RRB- was responsible for the shootings here in <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. There was a shooting overnight in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and we have officers en route there now,'' <PERSON> Wojdylak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said the slayings were `` within a day's drive and occurred on three successive days and the manner of the killing and the ... weapon used appears similar.'' Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Merrillville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, police said the slayings of two motel clerks earlier this year may be related to the killings in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Investigators with the <LOCATION> Jasper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, sheriff's office on Sunday told The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoman </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that new leads in the March 3 deaths led them to <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> as a suspect. They did not elaborate. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> investigators have tentatively set a meeting next week to discuss the killings in both states, which are `` strikingly similar,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Jasper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. In the slayings in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, all four victims were shot in the back of the head, said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> highway patrol dispatcher. The killings started early Wednesday in <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, when <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kochendorfer </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rains </PERSON>, 28, were abducted from convenience stores on opposite sides of the western <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> city. Their bodies were found hours later. On Thursday, <PERSON> Edley </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurrier </PERSON> was found dead in the photo processing shop he ran in <LOCATION> Pampa </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> panhandle. In <LOCATION> Ardmore </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was killed Friday and two other women were wounded. Police speculated the shootings occurred during a robbery. <ORGANIZATION> Ardmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Willingham </PERSON> said one of the survivors of the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> shootings, <PERSON> Joann </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>, identified <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> from photographs as the man who shot her, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Bean </PERSON> was listed in good condition Sunday at an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hospital, while Ms. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> was in serious but stable condition at another <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hospital. Dr. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Malowney </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Ardmore </LOCATION> medical examiner, said the shootings were `` almost ritualistic'' and `` more like an assassination than a shooting.'' Officials said `` less than $ 100'' was taken from the flower shop. Authorities said a tip led them to <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> at the hospital in <LOCATION> Lawton </LOCATION>, which is about 80 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Hank </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Inola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, said his son has been married twice, has five children, and moved to <LOCATION> Inola </LOCATION> about a year ago. He said his son's wife recently filed for divorce and moved the family to <LOCATION> Pampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where her parents live. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said he was glad his son had been caught. `` At least I know there is n't going to be anymore stuff going on by him ... God in heaven, I would have bet my life he did n't do it,'' he said Sunday after learning of his son's arrest. `` I hung on by a thin thread he was n't implicated in it. I've never experienced anything like this with that much terrible hurt,'' he said `` It was all uncalled for. He was n't raised like that.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s prior criminal history includes 1984 bogus check conviction and a 1977 forgery conviction, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that reports a former top diplomat in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> may have spied for the Soviets are `` very serious,'' but he does not have an assessment of potential damage to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I have known about this matter for some time and the minute I heard about it I was aggrieved because it is a very tragic thing should the allegations be true,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in commenting for the first time on <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who is under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The president refused to reveal details of the case, noting that the investigation is still under way. But he said: `` Any time a person is ... allegedly involved in something like betraying his country, that to me is a very serious matter.'' Asked about possible damage to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director, replied: `` I do n't think anyone could give you a full damage assessment'' at this time. He added that the case, if true, `` does n't help'' further better relations between the superpowers, even though everyone knows that `` espionage goes on.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> informed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> investigation `` within minutes after he learned of this.''

Asked why <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commented on a case still under investigation, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied, `` We normally do n't have a situation like this.'' The president's remarks came as <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s one-time superior, former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said he `` did not like'' <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>. `` There was something about him that bothered me,'' <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' program. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, now a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said, `` The more I got to know him the more I realized there was something dramatically wrong.'' He said he had <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who was second-in-command for most of his seven years at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> embassy, recalled in July 1987 because of `` insubordination.'' But The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today quoted the former director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vest </PERSON>, as saying, `` It was time for -LRB- <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> -RRB- to go, anyway, so we brought him back. He was not pulled back prematurely.'' Vest said <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> returned to attend a seminar for top diplomats. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said today that <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> was upset that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> went behind his back and lobbied against a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recommendation to place Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> on a list of people banned from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of Nazi activities. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> and Austrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> supporter, `` were very tight'' over that affair, said the official, who spoke only on condition he not be named. A year after the April 1986 recommendation was made, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was placed on the list. <PERSON> Stansfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration before <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s embassy stint, said `` it's not very likely -LRB- <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> -RRB- would know the specific names and details'' concerning <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> because such information is not normally shared with officials outside the agency. However, a person in <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s high position `` could have gotten into things that were n't normally his business'' because of his access to the embassy's cable section, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said on `` Good Morning America.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, legislative and law enforcement officials skirted questions Sunday about the inquiry into <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, the highest-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official ever implicated in an espionage investigation involving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who has not been charged with any crime, reportedly was filmed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials earlier this year passing a briefcase to a known Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agent in a European capital. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> are `` pursuing the inquiry thoroughly in order to identify the compromised security which has occurred and the appropriate steps,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s building pass and security clearance have been lifted. `` My directions are really not to comment on this case,'' an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Sunday. `` You're talking about security matters.'' Although reports remained sketchy, the picture was emerging of a 54-year-old career diplomat who was frustrated by his lack of advancement while serving in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> under two political appointees. <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, because of geography, traditionally has been a hotbed for East-West spy activity. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s close friend, Foreign Minister Mock, was quoted Sunday as saying he heard about the recent allegations of espionage through Austrian channels three weeks before the news broke in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday. Mock said in the Austrian tabloid Kurier there was `` a certain suspicion on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side reaching back into the 1970s'' about <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s activities. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> also served in the newly opened <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in 1974 as economic counselor, having been transferred from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s neighbors in an upper-class neighborhood in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> told reporters that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who had been under obvious surveillance by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> until news accounts of the spy probe aired late Friday, had not been seen since then. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday night he was under the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s watch at a private home north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with his wife and daughter. By all accounts, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, had access to sensitive intelligence material during his career, and officials expressed concern he could cause serious damage to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests if he shared his secrets with foreign powers. The Wall Street Journal reported in today's editions that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> helped shape the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s policy on transfers of sensitive technology to the Soviets and actively participated in the decision earlier this year to relax <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on transfers. One senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who worked with <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> told the Journal the most sensitive intelligence information on Soviet and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> security matters bypassed <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s office. But <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, as an office director, had access to general intelligence information, including a morning intelligence summary so sensitive officials are required to read it and return it to a waiting courier without copying it, the official said. Those who knew <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> well ruled out spying for money or ideology. <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> said he was `` deeply shaken and really shattered'' by the allegations. Sources told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> claimed he spied because he fell into a Soviet sex trap but that investigators have discounted the story. Some sources pointed to <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s frustration over having been passed over for an ambassadorship after serving under political appointees in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and running the embassy in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for a time. One of the ambassadors <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> served was <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Damm </PERSON>, an Austrian-born political appointee by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who caused a scandal in Viennese society by marrying <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guertler </PERSON>, a hotel owner. She resigned in June 1985, citing speculation that her marriage constituted a conflict of interest with her diplomatic duties. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> ran the embassy after <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Damm </PERSON> resigned until <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> arrived almost a year later.

 Forty years after they lost a civil war and thousands were sent to prison or into exile, Greek communists have joined conservatives in a government bent on prosecuting official corruption. An estimated 80,000 people were killed in the civil war that ended in 1949 and 25,000 communists were sentenced to death, life imprisonment or exile in remote mountain villages or barren <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> islands. The party was legalized 15 years ago and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s communists now are the only ones in a Western government coalition. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> endured years of hardship because the people at its core were tough and held little regard for their own lives,'' said historian <PERSON> Tassos </PERSON> <PERSON> Vournas </PERSON>. `` They spent years in exile, in prison, many were executed, but now we have passed from the age of fighting to an age of dialogue.'' Greeks began fighting each other when the Germans retreated in 1944 and the communists tried to assert their military strength. With British help, the conservative government checked the communist army, but a truce collapsed in 1946 and fighting resumed. Government forces crushed the communists three years later with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s support and aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which provided more than $ 2 billion under the <ORGANIZATION> Truman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to those executed, imprisoned or sent to internal exile, tens of thousands of Greek communists fled to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other countries in the Eastern bloc. After the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was banned in 1947, it stayed alive as the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed in 1951 and won 10 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. It had become the main opposition by 1958, with 24 percent of the vote and 79 seats, but its influence declined, and ended during the military dictatorship of 1967-74. The government of Premier <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Caramanlis </PERSON>, a conservative, legalized the party after the dictatorship ended in 1974. <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> led his <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to power in 1981 on promises to pull <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> out of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and close down <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases, two cornerstones of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> foreign policy. Election results indicated the communists had only slight and waning popularity. The party got 9.9 percent of the votes in the 1985 general election, down from 11 percent in 1981. `` This was one of the most critical periods in the party's history,'' said political analyst <PERSON> Stelios </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouloglou </PERSON> `` Communist parties throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were losing influence.'' <PERSON> Harilaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON>, former leader of the party, proposed at its congress in May 1987 `` a coalition of leftists and progressive forces.'' His invitation was aimed at a Eurocommunist faction that left the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968. The dissidents turned him on grounds the party toed the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> line. Early this year, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s government was falling into disarray because of allegations that members of the leadership were involved in scandals, and the two communist groups realized only unity would give them a significant role. In February, the Coalition of the Left and Progress was born with <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> as its president, and its platform appeared to be dominated by Eurocommunist thinking. <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON>, 75, resigned as secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> this month but remained as head of the Coalition. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> did not do as well in the June 18 general election as polls had suggested, 13.12 percent of the vote gave it 28 of the 300 seats in the unicameral parliament and a role as power broker. Both the conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party, with 145 seats, and the Socialists with 125 courted the communists. The Coalition refused to work with the Socialists unless they dumped <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and other officials accused of involvement in banking, financial and arms scandals. <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON>' coalition agreed to join <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> in a government devoted to cleaning up the scandals. It was sworn in July 2 with a pledge to call elections in three months. In 1944, seven leftists were given minor positions in a `` national unity'' government in an attempt to keep the communists from seeking power by military means. This time, the communists have the major Justice and Interior ministries. Premier <PERSON> Tzannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzannetakis </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>: `` Those who bring up the past belong to the past.''

 Pipe bombs exploded at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> recruiting station, a post office and other offices in a shopping center early today, police reported. Police reported no injuries in the bombings, the latest in a series of attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government facilities. An anonymous caller told radio station <ORGANIZATION> WKAQ </ORGANIZATION> that the two bombs had been placed by the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Forces, a little-known pro-independence group. Police could not confirm the authencity of the claim. The anonymous male caller said the bombing was to protest the presence of military bases in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the present commonwealth status. Police said the explosive devices went off at 2 a.m. at the shopping center about 10 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, causing `` considerable'' damage to the recruiting office, the post office and a supermarket. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and local police were investigating. Two explosive devices went off last week at post offices in the towns of <LOCATION> Coamo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guayama </LOCATION>. In June, the <ORGANIZATION> Borinquen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, also known as the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION>, or machete wielders, claimed responsibility for a bomb that caused heavy damage to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> recruiting station and a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bayamon </LOCATION>, about 15 miles northwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Borinquen </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s name before the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> conquest of the island. Similar explosions, with no injuries and minor damage, occurred in June at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs office in the southern city of <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION> and at a <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> branch in <LOCATION> Caguas </LOCATION>, about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. No group claimed responsibility for those blasts. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION> is a militant pro-independence group that has been relatively inactive in recent years. During the 1970s, the organization blew up five <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> fighter jets valued at $ 47 million and ambushed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vehicle, killing two sailors and injuring 10 others. Sixteen alleged members were charged in the $ 7 million robbery of a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, in 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> alleged that the Macheteros intended to use the stolen money to finance their campaign to gain independence for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, 55, still faces trial in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> and is currently being tried in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on separate charges stemming from the wounding of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent during his 1985 arrest in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The explosions came one day before Puerto Rico Constitution Day, which is an island holiday. The Constitution, approved 37 years ago, established the island's commonwealth relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In a referendum scheduled for 1991, voters on the island territory will have the choice of statehood, independence or continued commonwealth status. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, with 3.3 million mostly Spanish-speaking people, became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory in 1898 and has been a commonwealth since 1952.

 Torrential downpours in western <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Monday triggered flash floods and landslides that collapsed houses, and one report said at least 100 people had died. The deaths were reported by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency in coastal <LOCATION> Maharashtra </LOCATION> state after the rain flooded rivers and high winds knocked down houses and trees. At least 13 people died in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, the state capital, according to police. An official at <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>'s meterological office said 11 inches of rain was recorded in 24 hours. It is the highest figure recorded in one day since July 2, 1984, when 22 inches of rain fell. The rain was accompanied by winds gusting up to 52 mph, the official said. Bus and train services in the city were suspended and roads were inundated with waist-deep water. Trucks were stranded in swirling waters and several villages were cut off, police said. Transactions at the stock exchange, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s largest, were suspended, said M.R. <PERSON> Mayya </PERSON>, an exchange official. The army was called out in the districts of <LOCATION> Beed </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Deglur </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Biloli </LOCATION> to rescue the residents of 46 villages that had been surrounded by floodwaters. At least 2,400 fishermen were reported missing after they were caught on the seas during the storm, the news agency said.

 Heavy rain in northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> touched off floods and landslides that killed at least 117 people, destroyed thousands of buildings, and ravaged crops, official reports said Monday.

At least 1,400 flood-related deaths already have been reported in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this summer. The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said 41 people were killed and 381 people injured in landslides caused by torrential rains last week in <LOCATION> Dandong </LOCATION>, in the northeastern province of <LOCATION> Liaoning </LOCATION>.

 A federal appeals court today temporarily delayed the Iran-Contra trial of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s former station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The appeals court in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> issued an emergency stay at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, putting off the trial of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> in order to address national security issues that are threatening to kill the case. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> told a pool of prospective jurors to go home, saying he would call them back after the appeals court has an opportunity to rule on the national security questions. Earlier today, <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> rejected motions by the prosecutors in the case which would have allowed the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to protect details of some of its programs and the names of three of its stations and facilities in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from disclosure in the courtroom during the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> trial. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was to go on trial today on four criminal charges of obstructing and making false statements to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office and the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> allegedly tried to cover up his assistance to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret supply effort to the Nicaraguan Contras. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> will consider the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s request to intervene in the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case and <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to bar disclosure of the specifics about the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> stations and programs. In court, <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> rejected proposals by the government that would have limited disclosures about <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> stations and programs at the trial of <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> says he needs to present the information about the agency's stations and programs in his defense. One proposal presented by <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON>, who is prosecuting <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, would have referred to <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> stations and facilities in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries by a series of numbers rather than by name. <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> rejected that proposal. The judge also rejected a proposal <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON> made Friday in which the government offered to drop a portion of the case in exchange for not allowing disclosure of three highly sensitive <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> programs in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said it was important to <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s defense that he be allowed to refer in open court to the programs. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s seeking of an appeals court delay was a last-ditch attempt to avoid filing an unprecedented national security affidavit that would kill the case. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> is charged with lying and giving misleading statements to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office and to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in an alleged coverup of assistance to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret Contra resupply network. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence experts spent the weekend with <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials drafting an affidavit detailing national secrets that they will not alow to emerge in the trial. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office said Friday the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case would be untriable if the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s affidavit barred disclosure of too a wide range of material `` If the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a broader ... affidavit is granted, the case will be untriable,'' prosecutors said in court papers. With a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> affidavit in hand, <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> would have no choice under federal law but to prohibit the ex-CIA operative from using in his defense the classified information detailed in the affidavit. That could lead to the judge dismissing some or all the criminal charges, depending on the scope of the affidavit. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was charged with two counts each of making false statements and obstruction of an inquiry by the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of inspector general.

 The major summer film, a period piece about senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, opened Monday in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and added to the clamor of praise for the man blamed by many Chinese for the recent military crackdown. `` The Baise Uprising'' has as its hero a 25-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> leading the peasants of remote Baise in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to victory over Nationalist troops in 1929. The Nationalists ultimately lost a bloody civil war to the communists and retreated to the island province of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949. The movie's opening comes less than two months after the government called in troops to put down a student-led pro-democracy movement, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of people. Many Chinese say they have lost confidence in the government as a result, and many hold <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> responsible for the killings. `` The Baise Uprising'' fits neatly into the ideological education all Chinese are required to undergo. Most of those who attended the opening day showings at two <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> theaters were organized by their work units, and the movie could be required viewing for many Chinese. It opens nationwide on Aug. 1, the anniversary of the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Unless Chinese are told to see the movie, many doubtless would not pay the steep admission fee of about 67 cents _ five times the price of most films. In the one-hour, 45-minute film, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is portrayed as a confident, level-headed and charismatic leader with all the answers. But the film also shows a human side that one rarely sees in revolutionary-style movies. There are scenes of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, an avid bridge player, playing cards and telling a young girl that the strategies involved in playing bridge and chess are much like fighting a war. He also is depicted as a music lover who carries a record player with him on his campaign to <PERSON> Baise </PERSON>. When townspeople ask him to sing a song from his native <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province, he brings out the record player and puts on music from `` Carmen.'' The media has given enormous publicity to the movie, which was made to mark the 60th anniversary of the Baise uprising and the 40th anniversary of communist rule. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, the party newspaper, on Saturday devoted half a page to the film, with articles writen by <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qi </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jialin </PERSON>, the director. State-run TV last week broadcast a story on the movie's premiere, showing Vice President <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhen </PERSON> shaking hands with actors <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> and other top leaders supervised the movie's production, according to the People's Daily Despite the build-up, the audience at one afternoon showing at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Capital Theater seemed unimpressed. There was very little audience reaction, with only laughter during the two times <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> tells his followers to `` seek truth from facts,'' a slogan he has made famous in the past decade. Comments after the movie also lacked enthusiasm. A few people said, `` It was OK.'' Others just shrugged their shoulders and walked away One young woman said it was worth watching, but did n't say why The audience reaction was in stark contrast to another movie that opened a month ago in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. During the opening of `` The Towering Kunlun,'' about <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s battles with the Nationalists in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, audiences applauded scenes of students demonstrating. They also clapped when <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Leighton </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> promised money for weapons to the Nationalists, but only if Nationalist leader <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> did not to use the weapons against the students. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s comment since has been cut from the movie and the demonstration scene has been shortened Theater employees reportedly informed on those who cheered. That could explain the muted audience reaction to scenes in `` Baise Uprising,'' including an incident in which Nationalist troops shot at student demonstrators.

 Opera singer <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON>, whose deep bass voice and tall stature were famous in the title role in `` <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Godunov </PERSON>,'' has died of a heart attack, newspapers reported today. He was 54. The reports said <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON>, who often performed at the Metropolitan Opera in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, died Saturday night while celebrating a daughter's wedding at his farm in <LOCATION> Juva </LOCATION>, about 150 miles northeast of the capital. Newspapers reported, without quoting sources, that <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON> died of a heart attack shortly after dancing with his newly married youngest daughter. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Savonlinna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> today declined to comment on his cause of death and said his family also was refusing comment on funeral arrangements. The festival on Sunday was interrupted by an announcement of his death. The festival's artistic director, <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gronroos </PERSON>, said the father figure of Finnish opera had died. <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON> was artistic director of the festival in eastern <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> from 1972 to 1979, which he elevated to a major international opera event. Two months ago he agreed to become the director of the Finnish National Opera in 1992. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON>, a member of the committee to select a new director, described <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON>'s unexpected death as a `` catastrophe'' for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> and said `` it will be very difficult to find a suitable new director.'' <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON>, born Feb. 4, 1935, began his international career in 1960 and was acclaimed in major opera centers for his powerful bass voice. He also recorded extensively. The singer is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Anukka </PERSON>, and three children.

 Domino's <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, accused of endangering motorists as its drivers hustle to make deliveries within 30 minutes, will begin telling its side of the story on its pizza boxes. The nationwide publicity campaign will focus on Domino's claim that it puts a premium on speed in its kitchens, not on the streets. In a letter to be attached to 21 million Domino's boxes, company President <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> writes in part, `` Yes, a 30-minute delivery is important, but safe delivery is more important.'' The campaign follows a lawsuit filed in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> by a couple who claim they were injured in a collision with a Domino's delivery car and that the store manager was more concerned about haste in delivery than the accident. The store manager rushed to the scene and said: `` Let's get this pizza on the road,'' according to the lawsuit filed earlier this year by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kranack </PERSON>. The company has denied the allegation that the manager was more worried about the pizza than the wreck. The Ann Arbor-based chain said its 75,000 to 80,000 drivers were involved in 20 fatal accidents in 1988 and three so far this year.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said Monday it will arrest a radical student who plans to return from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> via the border at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> as a symbol of national unification. Prime Minister <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-hoon </PERSON> called an emergency meeting of key Cabinet ministers and the government later said it asked the U.S.-led <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> to warn communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> it will deny entry to radical student Im Su-kyong if she tries to cross the sensitive border area. A spokesman for the command, which polices the armistice in the southern half of the demilitarized zone, said it will not interfere in inter-Korean politics. The border is guarded by heavily armed troops and passage from one side to the other without mutual agreement is considered a violation of the truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean War. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, already angry at unauthorized visits to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by a dissident clergyman, a lawmaker and Ms. Im, said she will be arrested and charged with violating the national security law. Ms. Im, 20, has said she will cross the border Thursday, the anniversary of the cease-fire, to dramatize radical and dissident demands for unification of the divided peninsula. She flew to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> via third countries this month to attend an international youth festival. A <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspaper said if Ms. Im crosses the border, <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> soldiers attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> command have been ordered to arrest her. There are no physical boundaries in the truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. A person allowed access into the joint security area from either side would find it relatively easy to walk across. South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> said Monday that Ms. <PERSON> Im </PERSON>'s plan is an example of extreme leftist thinking and he warned college students not to take their freedom for granted Also on Monday, six students armed with firebombs, pipes, tear gas shells and leaflets demanding the withdrawal of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops tried to break into the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The students fled as police arrived. Two were arrested. Radical students said they will rally in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to welcome home Ms. Im and protest plans to arrest her. The radical <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> said it also will demonstrate to denounce the armistice agreement and the presence of 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. Also Monday, the national intelligence agency issued its third summons to <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, head of the leading opposition <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, asking he make himself available for questioning about a party lawmaker charged with espionage and making an unauthorized visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said he knows nothing about the case of legislator <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-won </PERSON> and accuses the government of trying to make him appear pro-communist. The intelligence agency said it will get a court to order <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s cooperation.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s second-quarter profit plunged by more than $ 1 billion, largely due to an $ 850 million provision for costs associated with the nation's worst oil spill, the company reported today. Net income fell 87 percent to $ 160 million, or 13 cents a share, from $ 1.2 billion, or 90 cents a share, in the comparable 1988 quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said. Revenue for the oil giant rose 9 percent to $ 23.6 billion from $ 21.63 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said the special second-quarter provision for expenses and legal claims stemming from the March 24 spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> reduced earnings by $ 850 million, or 67 cents a share. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said the provision includes amounts already paid out as well as estimated future outlays. The nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the tanker Exxon Valdez fouled hundreds of miles of water and coastline. `` Clean-up of the Alaskan oil spill was <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s top priority in the quarter,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON>. `` The magnitude of the required effort is huge and therefore costly.'' But <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s financial position remains strong. For the first half of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s provision for the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill totaled $ 880 million, including $ 30 million charged in the first quarter. Including the provision, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings totaled $ 1.4 billion, or $ 1.12 a share, for the first six months, down 46 percent from $ 2.66 billion, or $ 1.96 a share, in the first half of 1988. Without the provision, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s first half earnings were $ 2.3 billion, or $ 1.81 a share, down 13 percent. Revenue for the first half of 1989 rose to $ 45.86 billion from $ 43.63 billion a year earlier.

 The <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it expects to maintain close ties with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> regardless of who succeeds the fallen <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> as prime minister. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman, said Sunday's elections, in which <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lost control of the upper house of parliament, were `` an internal matter. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has long and strong relationships with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We certainly would expect those to continue under any successor government.'' Uno announced Monday he would resign as prime minister. His resignation will open the way to dissolving <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s Cabinet and restructuring the governing party's leadership. `` We do n't have any idea who that successor will be,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman said `` But, whoever it is, we look forward to working with them, to establishing friendly and productive ties of a kind that we have had in the past.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are bound economically and militarily, and `` we would expect to maintain all of those ties in a solid fashion.'' But he said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would continue to `` press rather vigorously'' on trade problems with the new government. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said that a non-binding congressional resolution calling for restrictions on the FSX jet fighter deal with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` faces a very heavy veto threat'' from the president. Several senior advisers have urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reject the measure as an intrusion on executive branch deliberations and because it `` compromises the president's ability'' to manage foreign affairs, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has until July 31 to act on the FSX resolution, but will probably make his decision before then, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Regardless of what course <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes, the joint development deal will go through because the congressional resolution is non-binding, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> never passed a binding resolution disapproving the joint venture. Under the FSX deal, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> will jointly develop the new fighter for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> based on an improved F-16 design. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had been set to develop a jet fighter by itself until then-Defense Secrtary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> talked the Japanese into the joint development, which ensures <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies 40 percent of the revenues from the project.

The conference will then proceed through the month of August in the form of working-level groups. The departure of Vietnamese troops, which backed up a pro-Hanoi and pro-Moscow government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, was long a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy goal. `` With an international, verified Vietnamese withdrawal, we hope to see a beginning of an end to the tragedy that has beset the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people for years, and a beginning of a transition to genuine Cambodian self-determination,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. Her statement said a settlement had to ensure peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by containing three key elements: _ A verified withdrawal of Vietnamese forces _ Prevention of a return to power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who have been implicated in the killings of as many as 1 million Cambodians during the 1970s _ Self-determination for the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people `` Given the legacy of warfare in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and the tragedies of the past it will be difficult to achieve peace,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` But it is necessary to try. It is time to at least try to end the suffering of the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people. We hope the day is near when the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people will be able to live in peace and achieve true self-determination.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, subject of intense takeover speculation for the past several weeks, said today it will cut 4,000 jobs, reduce its weapons business, repurchase shares and increase dividends. The sweeping restructuring will result in a 65-cent increase in the company's annual dividend, to $ 2.75 a share, and possibly include a special cash dividend, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Renier </PERSON>, chairman of the controls maker and defense contractor. The news prompted a sharp increase in <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> stock on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In early morning trading, the stock was up $ 3.75 a share to $ 89.25. The program will include the sale of a `` substantial portion'' of <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s 50 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Yamatake-Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese controls maker, <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> said. Analysts have valued the holding at about $ 1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> also will reduce its weapons business, which accounts for about 20 percent of its revenues. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON> would not say if a sale of the business is one of the options being considered. The program will include elimination of 4,000 jobs worldwide over the next 18 months, including 300 corporate staff positions targeted in a previous announcement. <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON> said the company is not ready to announce specific locations for the job cuts. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> employs about 78,000 workers worldwide. Many of the job losses will come through attrition, but layoffs will be necessary, <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors also has broadened a company stock repurchase plan from about 3.5 million shares to 10 million shares. The stock will be bought on the open market, <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> said. The program should improve operating profits by about $ 150 million over the next 18 months, <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> said.

 Five <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> inmates have temporarily waived their chances at parole so they can participate in an 18-month prison treatment program for sex offenders. Convicted rapist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON> said in an interview last week that agreeing to give up a May 1990 parole review, his first, was not difficult. `` I need the treatment more than I need my freedom,'' said <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON>, 28, serving a 10-year sentence imposed in 1986. Because of his commitment to the program he and the four others are next due for parole consideration in January 1991. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, in prison for 16 years since being convicted of rape, said waiving his chance to escape a 99-year term was the only way he had to help himself. He was to have had a February 1990 parole hearing. `` I came to the conclusion that if they let me out on the day I was thinking about, I would be back here in a month,'' said <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, 38, previously denied release in 1986 and 1988. `` I do n't want no more victims. <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and the other three who waived parole hearing dates are among 26 inmates participating in the state's sexual offender treatment program at the <ORGANIZATION> Bullock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION>, said director <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyk </PERSON>. The five are the first to give up a chance at release to seek treatment. The five were required to sign away their chance at parole during the 18-month period to ensure they would be able to finish therapy, said <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Frieson </PERSON>, director of mental health treatment for the state prison system. The program includes group sessions and exercises to enable inmates to overcome sexual arousal that leads to acts like rape and child molestation, <PERSON> Frieson </PERSON> said. `` The treatment is rugged enough ... that you have to have to be highly motivated to complete it,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyk </PERSON> said only inmates who admit to their crimes and to having a sex-related problem are admitted to the program. For inmate <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> McLoyd </PERSON>, confessing that he was the only one responsible for his 1978 rape conviction was the hardest part. `` I did what I wanted to do. My thinking was just so twisted, distorted,'' a weeping <PERSON> McLoyd </PERSON> said last week. He has been denied parole three times and put off his next hearing for nine months to enter the program. Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyk </PERSON> said the treatment is intended to teach inmates how to control their perverse desires when confronted with situations they find sexually exciting. While the men might always be excited by certain images or sounds, Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyk </PERSON> said, they can learn to quell their dangerous impulses. `` We're not curing anything. We're teaching people to control their arousal,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyk </PERSON> said officials do not know if the program is a success. Of 26 inmates who have completed the 18-month program, none has gone before the parole board and only one has completed his sentence. `` And the real test is when they get back on the street,'' she said. A similar program in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has had a 50 percent to 60 percent success rate in steering sex offenders away from more assaults, Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyk </PERSON> said, and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> officials would be pleased with similar results. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles, said he was unsure how the board would look upon sex offenders who have completed the program. But while the board is reluctant to release rapists and child molesters, he said, the inmates' willingness to stay in prison for treatment is `` rather remarkable.''

 High wind created treacherous currents in which three tourists drowned off unguarded southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> beaches, and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> lifeguards made at least 15 successful rescues, officials said. Beach Patrol Chief <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Sforza </PERSON> said the rip-tide remained dangerous Monday. `` It's insidious,'' he said. While the patrol did n't close the beaches Sunday, swimmers were warned to avoid the currents after the first two drownings. But many stayed in the ocean _ some within sight of the blanket-covered corpses on the beach. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said strong easterly wind caused rip currents, which develop when strong waves bring a lot of water close to the shore. The water then opens up gaps in sandbars and rushes back out to the ocean through channels. `` With each days you have same conditions, it exacerbates the rip currents,'' <PERSON> Sforza </PERSON> said. `` You get more and more sandbar breaks up and down the coast, so you have more rip currents.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said Monday he will resign because of his party's weekend election disaster, and once again the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> seek a leader to rescue them from a morass of scandal and unpopular policies. In Sunday's election for half the seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s upper house, the governing party lost its majority for the first time since its formation in 1955. Opposition leaders demanded the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> relinquish power and elections for the more powerful lower house be held early. The Liberal Democrats would be forced out if they lost those elections. Uno announced Monday he would resign after only two months in office to take responsibility for Sunday's balloting, in which voters chastised the party for money and sex scandals, a new sales tax that outraged housewives and more liberal food import policies that angered farmers. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has long and strong relationships with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. We certainly would expect those to continue under any successor government.'' Socialist candidates were the main beneficiaries of voter discontent with the party that has spent 34 years in power. <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> said Monday: `` To avoid inviting further confusion, the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> must hand over the government to the opposition parties.'' <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, head of the party, said she would call a meeting of opposition leaders to form a coalition to oppose the Liberal Democrats in the upper house. The Liberal Democrats retain a comfortable majority in the lower house, which chooses the prime minister and has most of the power, and elections need not be held until July 1990. The governing party has 293 of the 512 seats. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> said the new party president, who customarily becomes prime minister, should not be chosen through the usual backroom politicking that led to Uno's nomination. <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON>, a former prime minister who opposed choosing <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, said the next leader should be elected by the party's parliament members. <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanemaru </PERSON>, a former deputy prime minister and powerful party elder, also was said to favor an election. Uno was chosen by <PERSON> Kanemaru </PERSON>'s protege, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who had been chosen by <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s mentor, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resigned to take responsibility for the scandal in which the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> publishing conglomerate allegedly tried to buy influence with large political donations and cut-rate stocks. It took a month to decide on Uno, who was foreign minister and untouched by the Recruit scandal, as <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s replacement and few are willing to speculate about who might be the successor this time. Uno, a colorless politician with no power base, was seen as a safe choice after favored candidate <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> refused the job. Reports arose soon after he took office that he had kept paid mistresses, and opposition grew among women already angry about the 3 percent sales tax. Last month, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was said to have declared, `` I did n't become prime minister because I wanted to,'' and asked party leaders to let him step down. He did not mention the sex scandal in his televised news conference Monday, but said he was resigning after the election defeat because the `` ultimate responsibility is mine.'' `` It was a very difficult election,'' he said. Asked how he felt after announcing his resignation, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said his mind was `` meikyo shisui,'' a poetic phrase meaning tranquil as a mirror or still water. Of the 126 seats at stake in Sunday's election, the Socialists won 46 and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 36, according to final results announced Monday evening. Socialist strength in the 252-seat chamber rose from 43 to 66 and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> declined from 142 seats to 109. The Socialists ran only 54 candidates. Komeito -LRB- Clean Government -RRB-, a centrist party, won 10 seats, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 5, the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialists </ORGANIZATION> 3 and independents and minor parties 26. Rengo no Kai -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, a new party, also hurt the Liberal Democrats badly. It ran 12 candidates 11 of them won, most in districts where the governing party usually does well. Most of the new party's backing comes from the <ORGANIZATION> Rengo </ORGANIZATION> labor union. Any opposition coalition is expected to be fragile. Most parties oppose the sales tax, but they differ on such issues as defense policy and relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the past, the Socialists have favored disbanding military forces and scrapping the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> under which about 64,000 American soldiers are stationed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Socialist leaders now say they would seek only to revise the treaty, but Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> and others have said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships should be inspected and denied entry to Japanese ports if they carry nuclear arms.

<TEXT>
 Fans of `` Beauty and the Beast'' howled when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> left it off its fall schedule, but now the network has announced the weekly saga will return with a surprising two-hour movie. `` It is going to be a real corker, and I do n't want it to get out,'' CBS Entertainment President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> said of the movie plot Saturday during a speech at a TV critics convention. <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> said the series, about the love between a beautiful woman and a man-beast who lives in a subterranean world beneath <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, would veer away from the love story and that star <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> would have a `` reduced presence.''

He said it was initially dropped because executives thought the series had begun to `` implode on itself.'' `` Those stories between <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> and <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> just got more and more narrow and we were unable to explore issues that we want to explore. We think that we have corrected the problem, and what we're going to do, we're going to re-launch it as a two-hour movie that will have some rather stunning details attendant to it.''

 GOLUB-DOBRZYN, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ These may be beleaguered days for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but it does have its knights. The 15th century came alive this weekend, at an international tournament recalling the valor and vigor of a period of vast power. For a day, about 25,000 people put aside their economic woes that beset modern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to be transformed back to an era of pageantry, with knights atop their steeds testing their jousting skills according to regulations culled from historic records. `` It was the greatest age in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s history,'' says <PERSON> Zygumnt </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON>, director of the castle that was the site of an annual competition that saw knights from four countries in a pitched battle. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was independent then and was a peaceful superpower in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> never sought war with anyon and on the other hand it could counter any war threat.'' The tournament has been staged since 1977 on the grounds of the hulking brick castle that rises from a bluff, overlooking the apartment blocks of the central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Golub-Dobrzyn </LOCATION>. At their aid are damsels recruited from a local high school; competitors with crossbows, hatchets and pronged mallets; and thousands of common spectators whose murmers of respect and rumor _ `` Someone almost had his nose sliced off'' _ spread the spirit of the event. `` When I see the knights, I think about reviving old traditions of knighthood,'' said <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON>. `` It is not only the clothes but also reviving the spirit, the old traditions: honesty, keeping promises, honor. These are features that today have lost their value but without which it is hard to live,'' he said. Though bogged down by the demands of a modern knight-manager, the castle director says he could still `` get on a horse and defend the honor of the Polish knight.'' Those responsibilities fall mainly to the likes of <ORGANIZATION> Remigiusz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postolski </ORGANIZATION>, a 30-year-old <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> art restorer who with his teammates bested the knights from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Parici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arezzo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, was awarded the golden sword for individual performance at the close of hostilities Sunday. `` Almost every boy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> when he is small reads books and watches films about knights and their fights. For me it passed into a more serious interest,'' <PERSON> Postolski </PERSON> said. Most of the weapons, armor and costumes are made by hand, and modern knights must make some accommodations. Suits of armor ended with <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> sneakers and one crossbow champion wore skintight leggings of hot pink and black Spandex below his coat of mail. There's also the problem of how to sit on a slatted bench with a dagger at one's side. The castle, too, has met the modern age. The knights' pledge of princely competition is made by microphone, and a TV antenna rises from the ramparts. Flags and tablets mark great dates in castle history: 1296, 1527, 1965. The castle is owned by a government tourist agency. Much reconstructed from the ravages wrought by time and neglect, it is still in need of defense fortifications against tourists without tickets. But the hobbyists are loyal to the legends starting in 1385 when <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, united with <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> under the <ORGANIZATION> Jagiellonian </ORGANIZATION> kings, ruled a vast swath of central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> from the Baltic to the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and stretching east toward <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It was a time of cultural and scientific advancement, when <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Copernicus </PERSON> discovered the Earth's rotation around the sun and the <ORGANIZATION> Jagiellonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was established in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. But from a Polish knight's point of view, the era's highlight was likely the victory over the infamous Teutonic Knights, a Germanic order first established in 1191 for the Crusades. The most famous confrontation, the Battle of <PERSON> Grunwald </PERSON> on July 15, 1410, took place about 50 miles from the castle and the victory of the Polish and Lithuanian forces over the Teutonic camp _ after a knightly pre-battle exchange of swords _ has lived on into the modern history of three nations. <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON> is an animated and unabashed fan of the 15th century. What about poverty? `` It's exaggerated. We have much bigger extremes in wealth today.'' What about pestilence? `` What about AIDS?'' he retorts. `` We Poles have a kind of attraction to tradition and history,'' added <PERSON> Postolski </PERSON>, whose sword bore the nicks of a few `` friendly'' rounds. `` At that time our country was a European superpower.''

 Federal investigators said Monday they have uncovered no evidence that high-ranking government officials used a homosexual prostitution ring or that other patrons have been blackmailed by the escort service. `` It was a credit card case in the beginning, and it still is,'' said one law enforcement source who spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` There has been no indication yet of blackmail, espionage, or big names in this.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted raids on a posh northwest <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> home in February and May as part of a probe into the string of escort services, is involved in the case because of its traditional jurisdiction over credit card fraud, said spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also is conducting a separate, internal investigation of two uniformed officers accused of allowing lobbyist <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> to take several prostitutes on late-night White House tours.

 A self-described freedom fighter says his mission to aid the Contra rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government is back on track since a federal judge dismissed treaty violation charges against him. The criminal indictment charging <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> and five others with violating the Neutrality Act by supporting the Contras was dismissed July 13 by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The Neutrality Act allows prosecution of anyone making war from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil against a nation with which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is at peace. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON> agreed with the defense that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration waged war against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in 1984-85 despite congressional votes to cut off funds. <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>, 44, a co-founder of Civilian Materiel Assistance, said in an interview in Sunday's editions of The Birmingham News that his legal battles have ruined his produce business and cost him $ 100,000 in legal fees. But he said he's not bitter and has n't abandoned the goal he and a few conservatives set for themselves when they created <ORGANIZATION> CMA </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 _ fighting communism when, where and how they can, with <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> first on the list. Although professing no bitterness, <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> does express some disillusionment with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after all of his problems. `` I look at the White House people as more worried about their retirement and reputation than truth and justice,'' he said. `` He -LRB- President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- is the one who said the buck stops here, but when it got hot, he let it pass on through,'' <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> is preparing for the annual CMA convention in Madison Aug. 3-6, where Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and at least two top <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> field commanders will speak. He is sending more than 1,000 invitations. His budget comes primarily from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> CMA </ORGANIZATION> caps, shirts, belt buckles and a recently completed videotape of the Contras in action. The tape features a Soviet-made Hind-24 `` flying tank'' helicopter being shot down by Contras armed with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Redeye missiles. <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> said it's `` the only known footage'' of the top-of-the-line Soviet chopper going down. <ORGANIZATION> CMA </ORGANIZATION> literature promises that it will `` get your blood boiling.'' <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> CMA </ORGANIZATION>'s activities will remain in the field of of supplying non-lethal support to the Contra soldiers, away from the field of battle.

 Health and safety officials have broadened their inspection of the plant where The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> builds sections of the B-2 stealth bomber to include virtually all aspects of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s work on the top-secret plane State and federal inspectors have been trying to determine if chemicals and fiberglass-like composite materials used to make the radar-evading bomber pose a health threat to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employees. <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said last week that two state inspectors have made about five visits to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Developmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and expect to make more. Two inspectors from <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> also are examining parts of the south <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> plant. While the original inspection focused on the composite materials, the state's effort has been expanded to all aspects of B-2 construction, including examining machinery and looking for any safety hazards, Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. Air samples have been taken inside the plant to check for chemical levels, and employees are being interviewed about possible problems, she said. No complaints have been received from workers at the high-security plant, Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said, adding, `` We just want to make sure that we're covering all the bases.'' Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was fined nearly $ 1.5 million by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> following inspections at its <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. That plant produces a plane technologically similar to the B-2, the F-117A stealth fighter <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s work on the stealth bomber is as a subcontractor for the main builder, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. By law, Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said, state officials can not release results of the inspection until it is complete and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has been informed of the findings. She said the work probably will be completed by late July or early August. The plant inspection is being done at the request of Rep. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, D-Wash., who was concerned about the safety of chemicals used in aerospace construction The inspection began June 6, about two weeks later than originally planned. The delay occurred when the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denied the state inspectors access to some of the areas because they did not have security clearances and <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors had to be brought in, Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> would have allowed us in. It was essentially the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> that denied us entry,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> has quoted unidentified plant workers as saying the delay was used to clean and fix up shop areas in anticipation of the inspection. `` The walls were wiped down, new tops were put on the tables _ it was nothing like our normal working condititions,'' the newspaper quoted one employee as saying. `` We did not issue directives to go and do anything unusual,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvasnosky </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the Developmental Center. The company has safety and housekeeping operations that take place continually, he said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON>, assistant regional administrator for <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, declined to say what his inspectors were examining, citing security reasons. But he said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s role was `` very limited,'' involving only a small portion of the plant. <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s work should be finished in about a month. In the past year, dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> employees at an <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> plant who worked with phenol formaldehyde complained of a variety of ailments, ranging from dizziness and rashes to memory loss. The chemical was used to make luggage bins and other jet interior parts. Air sampling at the plant found formaldehyde levels well within federal standards, but <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> discontinued use of the chemical and improved ventilation at the plant. Phenol formaldehyde has not been used at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kvasnosky </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Desert Tortoise Placed On Endangered Species List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The desert tortoise in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and other Western states was placed on critical `` endangered'' species status Monday because it is threatened by a fatal respiratory disease, a congressional aide said. The action taken by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, acting director of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to anger cattle ranchers worried about the declaration's possible impact on their grazing rights on federal land where the tortoise is found. The designation applied to the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> population of the tortoise west and north of the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, including those in southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and northwestern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Guldan </PERSON>, spokesman for Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>. The Sonoran desert tortoise population, located south and east of the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, was not affected, <PERSON> Guldan </PERSON> said. The emergency designation means all the protections of the Endangered Species Act immediately go into effect for 240 days. Fish and Wildlife studies found desert tortoise populations in the western Mojave have declined 58 percent since 1985 because of the respiratory disease. Before the designation was announced, Fish and Wildlife officials said the agency had been petitioned by environmental activists concerned about the outbreak of the disease, which had been seen before only in tortoises in captivity. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Middaugh </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, said the disease may have been spread by someone releasing a captive tortoise into the wild. His group filed a lawsuit in federal court for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> last week seeking to force the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> to protect the tortoise.

<TEXT>
 The investigation of senior diplomat <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> on suspicion he spied for the Soviets has again turned the spotlight on <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> as a hotbed of East-West espionage and intrigue. <PERSON> Orson </PERSON> <PERSON> Welles </PERSON>' depiction of <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lime </ORGANIZATION> in the 1949 film `` The Third Man'' stamped on the minds of millions an image of devious dealings in the Austrian capital, which, like <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, was divided into British, French, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet sectors after World War II. Former Nazis and refugees from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> struggled to survive in the postwar turmoil, selling knowledge to any side that would pay and helping to weave a net of intrigue. The Soviets withdrew their forces from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in 1955, but they left behind a large embassy and many other offices that Western intelligence agencies always have viewed as potential helpers of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> GRU </ORGANIZATION>, Soviet military intelligence. Intelligence sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> say nearly every American taken to court on charges of spying for the Soviets in the past five years had come to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to meet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officers. The Soviets are as aware as the Americans that these trips often are part of the evidence used by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Some intelligence sources believe, therefore, that one purpose of the trip to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> is to get a blackmail hold over the American, threatening exposure of a hard-to-explain journey if he wants to wriggle out of his deal with the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. Americans who have made <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> trips include <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelton </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officer who tipped <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to a system that hid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> submarines from Soviet radar, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, head of the family spy ring in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Court documents in the <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> case included written instructions from the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> about how to `` drop'' information, including a detailed description of doing a walking `` pass'' on a <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> street. It was also in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Marine </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonetree </PERSON> confessed to a security breach in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. A Soviet defector who worked for the <ORGANIZATION> GRU </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in the 1970s described <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s elaborate intelligence network in the Austrian capital in a 1985 memoir, `` Aquarium,'' published in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvorov </PERSON> -LRB- not his real name -RRB- said detailed procedures were worked out to avoid immediate identification by Austrian and other security services in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> of agents in the embassy. He estimated about 80 percent of all Soviets in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> _ where <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> office, trade representations, and a large diplomatic presence at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> _ engaged in `` other work'' outside their official duties. Part of the elaborate coverup of Soviet intelligence work, according to <PERSON> Suvorov </PERSON>, was to assign active agents, such as himself, mostly to work outside <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. But most of the work, he said, focused on acquiring Western technology and contingency plans for military or economic crises. It is not known what information, if any, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> handed to the Soviets during his seven years in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, where he arrived in 1980 as head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s economics section. He became deputy chief of mission, a post he held for years before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1987. However, his position would have put <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, a native Austrian who left the country at age 3 with his Jewish parents, at the center of sensitive U.S.-Austrian negotiations over the illegal transfer of Western technology through <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. Several Viennese shipping agents and firms have come under scrutiny in the past decade amid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations they helped the Soviets and their allies to acquire technology that was banned for export to the East. Austrian intelligence sources say they do keep a careful watch for illegal activities. Austrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, bristled Monday when reporters suggested <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> was a hotbed of spying. `` These regrettable events are not more numerous than elsewhere,'' <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> said, allowing however that <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> is perhaps exposed because of its `` geographical position'' just an hour's ride from the Czechoslovak and Hungarian borders There are tens of thousands of Soviet and East European scientists, emigres, diplomats and other officials in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, making blanket surveillance tough. In 1981, Soviet researcher <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Belozerov </PERSON> denied reports he had spied but caused a stir when he resigned from a post at the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION>, a 17-nation project south of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> that has attracted hundreds of Soviet researchers since it was set up in 1972. A neighboring institute in the same town of <LOCATION> Laxenburg </LOCATION> was in the news the same year when <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodic </PERSON>, a Czechoslovak historian who had been granted asylum in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> as a signatory of the Charter 77 human rights appeal, suddenly disappeared. <PERSON> Hodic </PERSON> turned up in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, where state-run media said he had been working all along as a Czechoslovak agent. One of the most mysterious cases centered on <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> was that of <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadrin </PERSON>, said to have been a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> defector turned double agent for <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shadrin </PERSON> disappeared when he went to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to meet two <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents in December 1975. The disappearance did not become public until July 1977, when <PERSON> Shadrin </PERSON>'s Polish-born wife said he had been kidnapped and appealed for help to get him back. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government pledged its assistance but has never disclosed <PERSON> Shadrin </PERSON>'s fate.

<BYLINE>Hundreds March in Tbilisi; Strike Disrupts Factories ^By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TBILISI, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of protesters marched in the capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on Monday after 10 days of ethnic violence in the republic's western region, and organizers of a strike said it had affected 33 factories. A day of marches in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> culminated in an evening rally attended by 2,000 people shouting `` Freedom from the U.S.S.R.!'' and slogans protesting the alleged failure of authorities to protect Georgians from armed attacks in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the national legislature ethnic unrest in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> had spread to <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, causing `` the disorganization of transportation'' on Monday, adding: `` The situation became acute.'' Most stores and other businesses appeared to be open, but <PERSON> Irakli </PERSON> <PERSON> Tseretel </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> and a rally organizer, claimed 33 factories were closed, including two military plants. <PERSON> Tseretel </PERSON>'s report could not be confirmed and three other informal groups that favor Georgian independence were boycotting the strike, fearing a repeat of April 9, when 20 demonstrators died at the hands of soldiers. Another speaker at the rally, <PERSON> Zviad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsachurdia </PERSON>, demanded the arrests of those responsible for attacks on ethnic Georgians in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>, a separate administrative area within the republic. An editor at the Georgian news agency <PERSON> Gruzinform </PERSON> said buses did not appear Monday morning in some regions of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, but that service was normal by midday. The interrupted bus service appeared linked to a transit strike, including a railway walkout that began over the weekend and ended Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said the rail strike stranded thousands of people. Several hundred people demonstrated throughout the day in central <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, protesting the violence in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>. `` When those Abkhazians started to knife Georgians, it just drove us out of our minds,'' said the news agency editor, <PERSON> Nana </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelashvili </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said no armed clashes had been reported in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> for two days, but it reported more confiscations of weapons from extremists by internal security troops and police. Authorities seized 104 rifles and more than 500 pounds of explosives in the previous 24 hours and found a cache of 130 pounds of explosives and 6,500 feet of detonating cable near the Abkhazian village of <LOCATION> Gvandra </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Residents of <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> voluntarily turned in 744 firearms, the agency reported. Nineteen people have been reported killed and more than 400 injured since July 15 in clashes between warring Georgians and Abkhazians in the seaside resort area 880 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Two regional <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> secretaries and two government leaders in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> were dismissed Saturday. Each ethnic group blames the other for the trouble. Abkhazians, a minority in their own region, want more economic independence and cultural rights. Georgians insist the enclave remain part of their <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republic. During the past month, at least 132 people have been killed in ethnic unrest in the southern Soviet republics of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A city that has trouble paying for trash collection has been billed for hundreds of unauthorized long-distance telephone calls, including many to dial-a-porn services. The cash-starved city's monthly bills average $ 5,000 and include calls to virtually every state, the <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> -RRB- News-Democrat reported Sunday. Many phones in the police and maintenance departments logged calls to `` 900'' prefix adult talk lines, the paper said. Treasurer <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the number of questionable calls in each month's two-inch-thick bill shows the need for an internal auditor. `` After I suggested it to the -LRB- aldermanic -RRB- council two years ago, they cut my staff in half,'' she said. A continuing cash crunch has made it hard for the city to pay salaries and collect garbage in recent months. In a review of bills from March, April and May, the paper found hundreds of dollars worth of calls from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and other places were charged to the city either by reversing the charges or by using a city credit card number. Many outgoing calls from City Hall were equally questionable. There were calls to a trivia line that gives callers a chance to win prizes, to the Dunes Hotel in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, and to a pay phone in a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> hospital. And there were at least 16 calls from a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> number to the beeper of a man convicted on Friday on charges of running a cocaine ring.

 A private memorial service will be held for <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelme </PERSON>, an award-winning modern fiction writer who died of cancer at the age of 58. <PERSON> Barthelme </PERSON> was known best for his wry humor and innovative techniques in short stories, many of which were published in The New Yorker, <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Review. <PERSON> Barthelme </PERSON> underwent successful surgery for throat cancer 17 months ago. But he became ill with a form of blood cancer while living in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> this summer and was admitted to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> three weeks ago. He died Sunday. <PERSON> Barthelme </PERSON> also was an English professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was a reigning presence in the program,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, poet and professor of English at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> was the kindest man I've known. He had a deep-bred Southern courtesy and a kind attitude towards life, personally and professionally. `` I've looked to him often as a mentor, teacher and friend.'' A former newspaperman, <PERSON> Barthelme </PERSON> wrote 15 books, including several novels and collections of short stories.

<HEAD>Townspeople Hold Raffle to Pay Part-Time Cop's Hospital Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Townspeople are collecting money to help their part-time police chief, who was hurt in the line of duty but checked out of the hospital because the town does n't have insurance. Chief <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodda </PERSON>, whose jaw was fractured in three places when he was slugged by a man he arrested for refusing to pay a $ 24 restaurant tab, said Monday he's having trouble making ends meet. `` Things are kind of tough right now, because I support the family during the summer driving a truck and I ca n't work,'' <PERSON> Rodda </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Rodda </PERSON>, 52, was hospitalized for two weeks with a broken jaw, brain swelling and other head injuries. But he checked out July 14 when he learned the town of 600 in the <LOCATION> Berkshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> does n't have insurance to cover officers hurt in the line of duty. <PERSON> Selectmen </PERSON> declined to discuss the chief's claim at a meeting Thursday. Board Chairman <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> instead read a statement which said, in part: `` Certainly the town is grateful for the 30 years of service Mr. <PERSON> Rodda </PERSON> has devoted to the town.'' Officials declined to comment on the case on advice of town attorney <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> did not return telephone calls to her office Friday and Monday. Residents are pitching in to help the chief. A can for donations has been set out at Town Hall. And the Jiminy Peak ski resort is organizing a raffle to raise money for his medical bills, said marketing director <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubin </PERSON>. `` It's a small town and we all know that if it was someone else in trouble, that he'd be in the front of the line helping out,'' <PERSON> Dubin </PERSON> said. Organizers do n't know how much money has been raised. <PERSON> Rodda </PERSON> keeps the peace on an on-call basis, and for most of 30 years has n't charged the town for his services. The town's two other part-time officers have refused to work since the chief's injury `` The townspeople are all for me,'' <PERSON> Rodda </PERSON> said. `` They'll eventually get after the selectmen and I'll sue if I have to. <PERSON> Rodda </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spina </PERSON>, said Monday that state law provides little protection for volunteer firefighters or part-time police. `` People who serve as police and firefighters in small towns are at a tremendous disadvantage if they get hurt in the line of duty,'' <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said. `` I'm not sure if they or the towns really understand how much of a disadvantage.'' If selectmen reject his claim for medical expenses, which <PERSON> Rodda </PERSON> said now exceeds $ 10,000 and time lost from work, the chief can sue, <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said. State compensation laws appear to put a $ 3,000 annual limit on payments for time lost from a regular job by volunteer firefighters and special police. `` You ca n't support a family on $ 3,000 a year,'' <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said. `` It's less than welfare.'' <PERSON> Rodda </PERSON> still needs surgery to repair his jaw. When the chief was hit June 30, his head slammed against the pavement when he fell. Five witnesses captured the alleged assailant, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, who had been at the <LOCATION> Berkshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail awaiting trial, was transferred to <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for psychiatric tests last week after allegedly attacking a guard.

 <LOCATION> LA </LOCATION> <LOCATION> CELLE-SAINT-CLOUD </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> told resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> on Monday that there wo n't be any role for <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in an interim government. At a news conference following four hours of meetings, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said the discussion failed to produce any results but noted more talks were scheduled Tuesday. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said there was `` complete disagreement.'' The encounter was designed to pave way for an international conference toward ending the 10-year-old war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by setting up a transition government. The monthlong conference begins Sunday, two months before Vietnamese troops backing <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s pro-Moscow government are to complete their withdrawal. The meeting between the two leaders at an 18th century chateau in this <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> suburb is to be expanded Tuesday to include <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and leaders of the three-faction resistance coalition: <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> of the non-Communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON>, the nominal chief of the Chinese-backed communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> since the reported resignation of former leader <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians during a three-year reign that ended with the Vietnamese invasion in December 1978. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> continues to insist on including the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in an interim government made up of the three resistance groups and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s government. He contends that giving the strongest of the three guerrilla groups a place in the power structure is the price of avoiding renewed civil war. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> disagrees. `` We think such a version simply signifies making the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people hostage to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Our position is that we are not hostages of <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> and we will not let the interests of the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people be bargained against the Pol Pottists.'' <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> took `` two steps backward'' at Monday's meeting, but he refused to call it a failure, noting discussions would continue Tuesday. Besides the future role of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, other issues on the agenda include discussion of a cease-fire and a mechanism to monitor the withdrawal of the remaining Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, estimated at up to 70,000. The Cambodian prime minister blamed the impasse on <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s insistance that as coalition president he was representing three parties In agreements reached at previous meetings, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> represented only himself. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said there should be only two <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> delegations to the peace talks: his government and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has the backing of many Western nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. There has been growing international support for reaching a settlement that does not include the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> will attend the opening session of the international conference Sunday, and a spokeswoman reiterated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> role in an interim government. The conference is to include the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> leaders plus all five permament members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ as well as <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and members of <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION>: <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. As he left the chateau, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said the resistance coalition intended to keep fighting. The exiled prince, deposed in 1970, said that after the Sept. 30 Vietnamese withdrawal, 130,000 Vietnamese troops will remain in the country `` hidden'' in the Cambodian army. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s delegation distributed a copy of a cease-fire protocal under discussion. However, as late as Friday, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> rejected a cease-fire so long as armed Vietnamese remain in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Secretary Calls For `Revolution;' Analyst Says Car Still King</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> called on Monday for a `` revolution in transportation,'' possibly including high-speed rail systems, but a private analyst said the car will remain king. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> launched a series of nationwide hearings aimed at drawing up a national transportation policy for rail, highway, air and water travel. Meetings are to be held in large and small cities throughout the country through mid-September. The first one, in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> auditorium, featured the heads of some of the country's biggest airline, railroad and automobile companies and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, who said the whole system is a `` handyman's special.'' If the nation's system of roads, rails, waterways and airports were listed in a real estate ad, she said, it would say: `` Lots of potential, oldstyle craftsmanship with many modern conveniences, but needs work, a real fixer-upper.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who moderated the first session and will attend some of the other meetings, said a decision to build high-speed rail systems is one possible result of the effort. This could include trains that travel up to 300 mph, particularly between cities where air travel has reached maximum levels. `` It is time for a new revolution in transportation, and hopefully it will be a peaceful revolution,'' said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. In an interview prior to the meeting, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the nation's airports, highways, bridges, waterways and mass transit systems are simply wearing out `` We're going to have to rebuild it and replace it, or we're not going to be able to rely on it anymore,'' he said. Among the most critical problems, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, are a lack of planning for new airports and neglect of $ 80 billion worth of work needed on deteriorating bridges. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, senior research fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, told the opening session that no new system is in the wings that will revolutionize transportation within the next 25 years, so old systems have to be made more efficient. He said the fastest growth is in suburban areas as urban density continues to decline and automobile use increases. The <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> is a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank that has studied several national issues, including transportation needs. `` The country has become ever more tied to its personal, on-demand, point-to-point transportation system: automobiles,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. `` Despite oil shortages and price increases, the lamentations of many environmentalists and urban planners, and multi-billion dollar federal investments in urban transit, nothing has dented the dominance of the automobile,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and other companies are studying `` smart cars and smart highways'' that would be computerized for increased safety and efficiency. In the meantime, he said, some simple things can be done to improve road travel in many areas: traffic light coordination, improved toll road payment procedures, and clearer and brighter highway signs and markings. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is inviting citizens with ideas about how to move Americans in the 21st Century _ and about how to pay for the changes _ to attend the hearings around the country or to send written proposals to the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The transportation secretary said he does n't want the sessions to turn into a littany of complaints. `` You should n't go if you're just going to say, ` We've got gridlock, somebody ought to do something about it,' because we know that,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. `` These are needs and idea sessions.'' The first meeting outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will be held in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, on Tuesday, with the focus on rural transportation issues. The last meetings will be in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Sept. 11-12 and will deal with drug and alcohol use in the commercial transportation system and federal research and development.

 <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clack </PERSON>, the Disabled American Veterans' man of 1989, has spent 10 years trying to do for other veterans what some caring people did for him <PERSON> Clack </PERSON>, who will be recognized Sunday as the <ORGANIZATION> DAV </ORGANIZATION>'s Outstanding Disabled Veteran for 1989, has worked for the past decade at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where he spent much of his 21-month recovery following a battle injury in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> that claimed both legs and one arm. `` To come back here ... this is n't just a job,'' <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> said. `` It's an opportunity to serve veterans. `` It's a unique opportunity, to work at the level I work at and see the continued goodness we do,'' said <PERSON> Clack </PERSON>, an assistant to the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> since 1979. `` I think we deliver the finest health care in the world today _ I did when I was a patient, and I still do.'' The 42-year-old Stone Mountain man, who holds Silver Star, <ORGANIZATION> Bronze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> and Purple Heart medals, has spoken about veterans' issues in all 50 states and is n't shy about discussing much of anything, including his disability But he'd rather talk of opportunities ahead than dwell on an injury 20 years ago. `` God left me with my brain intact, my mouth in gear and my left arm to be independent. What else do we need in life?'' he said. `` We're lucky to be alive, and let's go forward.'' <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> was active in politics for several years, working in the campaigns of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleland </PERSON>, among others, until his job with the federal <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> forced him to curtail his politicking. He misses it. `` I always busted my buns for whoever I believed in,'' he said. Last year, he was co-chairman of the committee to erect <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s Vietnam Veterans Memorial at the state Capitol. <PERSON> Clack </PERSON>, who was serving in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 25th Infantry Division in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> when an exploding shell hit him, persevered through a long recovery and more than 30 operations. `` When I was laid up in bed, and not expected to live, there were many times when I'd wake up and somebody to my right, or my left, or across from me had died,'' he said. `` Obviously, I've got a lot to be thankful for.'' <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> will be honored Sunday at the DAV National Convention in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. `` It's nice to be selected, but the country's full of outstanding veterans who never get recognized,'' he said. `` To me ... getting awards is not where life really is. If we go through life doing the best we can do, we're always going to be ahead of the game _ that's how I play every day of life.''

 The revolt of Japanese voters against the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gave a strong boost to the Socialists, but analysts say it was far more conservative than the result would indicate. In Sunday's election, the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lost their majority in the upper house of Parliament for the first time since the party was formed 34 years ago. The Socialists gained 24 seats, thanks to support from women, farmers and others disgruntled with the governing party's scandals and economic policies. A record number of women candidates, 22, won their races. <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> attracted adoring crowds of women who wore pink scarves and applauded her criticism of the Liberal Democrats. When <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> announced his resignation Monday, women reveled in their role in helping remove him. Their anger over allegations that he had kept paid mistresses hampered <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s efforts to restore his party's reputation after an influence-buying scandal forced predecessor <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to quit less than two months ago. Bread-and-butter issues appeared to be even more important. `` I really believe that this was a people's revolution coming from the kitchen,'' said <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinsaka </PERSON> of the labor-backed <ORGANIZATION> Rengo </ORGANIZATION> no Kai, a new party, who won election in <LOCATION> Nara </LOCATION>. The Socialists do n't propose nationalizing industries or equalizing incomes, but talk of restoring faith in politics, repealing the new 3 percent sales tax, re-establishing protection for farmers who complain about more open import policies and improving the environment. Many women candidates campaigned not as feminists, but as `` ordinary housewives'' defending their homes against the sales tax. `` What this vote shows is that people want a return to the status quo,'' said <PERSON> Seisaburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, a political analyst. `` It was the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> that tried to change things.'' <PERSON> Kuniko </PERSON> <PERSON> Inoguchi </PERSON> and other analysts said the economic prosperity that has characterized more than three decades of <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> government may have encouraged the discontent. `` When the economy is good, people can afford to be critical,'' <PERSON> Inoguchi </PERSON> said. `` They can afford to worry about issues of justice. `` The <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> had modern policies but closed, premodern political practices. They were telling everybody to adjust to change _ economic liberalization and internationalization _ but did n't make an effort to change themselves.'' Although the Liberal Democrats still may have a protectionist reputation abroad, they have made major changes in the past few years, usually under foreign pressure. Beginning four years ago, the government helped the yen rise and import barriers fall enough to transform the structure of the economy and hurt important groups, such as the farmers. Economic growth, still robust, now comes more from domestic consumption and investment than exports. Japanese are richer than ever before and mamanufactured imports have increased 78 percent since 1985. Protection of agriculture is being chipped away. A tax reform package many experts consider economically sound but clumsily introduced has given salaried workers more money to spend and may help bring <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy more in line with those of its trading partners. The sales tax part has outraged housewives, however. Women seek change in several areas. They have joined the labor force in record numbers, helped by an equal opportunity law, but often in poorly paid part-time jobs. Affluence has meant free time and more education, but women are angered by lingering discrimination exemplified by Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Hisao </PERSON> <PERSON> Horinouchi </PERSON>'s recent remark that they are `` useless in politics.''

 Extravagant was the name of the game Monday as couturiers took a trip to dreamland in their winter shows. With the bicentennial of the French Revolution, designers seem intent on bringing back clothes fit for a queen. The biggest news was at Dior, as the Italian couturier <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> nearly brought down the tent in an outdoor show at the gardens of the <ORGANIZATION> Salomon-Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>, named in May to replace <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohan </PERSON>, was chosen to add excitement to the world's most prestigious label. <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> obviously made the grade, with his opulent collection of fitted clothes that led off with a waist-cinching fitted black crepe redingote topped with a stovepipe hat. He finally wound up in a Dioresque whirl of strapless ball gowns with tulle petticoats, wrapped sable stoles and jackets, plus huge organza bows, and bouquets of lily of the valley _ a favorite at Dior. <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> managed to combine all the sumptuous fabrics and furs in rigorously constructed clothes that looked both retrospective and beautifully modern. He did a marvelous job of making red or pearl gray persian lamb look like embroidered lace on a sexy strapless sheath evening gown. He made fitted suits of creamy-beige ostrich leather look soft and feminine. <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> showed skirt lengths flatteringly around midknee for daytime _ or opted for dressy trousers above the ankle. Arms were slim under shoulders with a whisper of padding for shape. Whether caped ball gowns, satin trousers or tweed suits in bold herringbones with sparkly sequins, the <ORGANIZATION> Dior </ORGANIZATION> line looked fit to win. Hem lengths were irrelevant in most of the dazzling parades of lucre. `` It's a trip abroad, a dream,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON> who decked out his daughter and favorite model <PERSON> Laetitia </PERSON> like a glamorous toy soldier, complete with gold tasseled epaulets and braid-edged cap. <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON> also was on the road to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which he trod a few years ago. This time, it was richer than ever, with lame-shot sari silks and chiffons, galloon-edged boleros, rich shades of panne velvet and Persian embroideries worn with silk and gold lame turbans. `` You could wear this with jeans,'' said <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON>, gesturing to a richly braided military jacket with gold frog buttons. Chocolate is hot for next winter, and <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON> went all out for the browns, jazzing them up with shades of red from flame and coral to cyclamen, plus some peacock and royal blue. <ORGANIZATION> Balmain </ORGANIZATION>'s designer <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortensen </PERSON> also used prodigious amounts of expensive fabrics in a successful extravaganza. The man who practically reinvented shorts for couture went in for a pedal-pusher pants, making them extraordinarily beautiful with their toppers of bright teal blue, pistachio or flame-flared jackets with bold buttons and funnel collars. <PERSON> Mortensen </PERSON> pulled off a clever trick by covering bodies with full tent-like shapes, then baring legs clad in tights with gold Persian embroidery up the sides. Among the memorable coats were the gray-black-white pyramids in mohair and Mongolian goat, and the red-and-green lacy models tufted with marabout or ostrich _ fun but not very warm. The gold, copper and lame stiffened silk dresses stiffened like thin sheets of metal were draped perfectly, slit up the leg for walking. But they also dragged fishtail-trains, better for standing around than circulating at a cocktail party. But even with piling on fabrics, stiff ruffles and sparkling details, <PERSON> Mortensen </PERSON> made it all look floaty and light. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> got an enthusiastic hand for his winter collection, which sparkled with enough titillating geometric details to evoke his old magic. He obviously was tired of short skirts, showing very few. He preferred a midcalf narrow skirt, or else simply no skirt at all just a long jacket over tights, or slightly flared pants. Shoulders were natural or eclipsed by important collars, always a strong point with <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>, who knows how to play with shapes like a kid with cutouts. The coats often had kimono or handkerchief sleeves, and some had tiered skirts under a narrow bust. The favorite waistline was dropped to the hip, emphasized by a narrow leather belt, the coat gathered like a ruffle beneath it. The fun popped up in high-collared short coats edged at the armhole in fake fur or Mongolian lamb, in leather-banded sleeveless sweater-coats, or in caped poncho looks. Evening wear by <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> was just as rich. Using stiffened hoops and pleats _ the basic <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> shapes _ <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> sculpted some dashing ladies of the night in <LOCATION> Chantilly </LOCATION> lace, fuschia and pistachio taffeta, diaphanous chiffon. And they were topped by funny hats _ the favorite ones a pillbox big as a hatbox, wrapped in satin ribbon, and a mortarboard tied with a scarf.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lobbied senators Monday to support his $ 295 billion defense budget, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs `` maximum flexibility'' in arms control negotiations. The president called a bipartisan group of senators to the White House for a pep talk as lawmakers prepared for congressional floor action on military spending measures. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said defense programs are `` complicated, expensive,'' he urged full funding for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal program. Already, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has made some `` important cuts'' in defense, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, praised <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> for making tough choices in killing six or seven programs The committee has `` been willing to bite a part of that bullet, too,'' he said, adding: `` We hope the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will stick with us because we have basically backed the <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> budget.'' Among the potential targets of congressional budget-cutters are the B-2 bomber, known as the stealth, the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, and how much money to give the rail-mobile MX missiles or the single-warhead Midgetman. The expensive B-2 _ each plane is expected to cost more than $ 500 million _ has been criticized by some lawmakers. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the radar-evading plane a `` revolutionary technology'' that is vital to the nation's defense. He said he could justify the B-2 expense because `` when you look at the full defense program, I want to have maximum flexibility as we have arms control negotiations.'' The administration's defense outline calls for 132 bombers at a cost of $ 70.2 billion. For fiscal 1990, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to spend $ 4.7 billion, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has already cut $ 800 million from the program. Last week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his pitch to members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he is hopeful the administration will get money for three bombers in the current round. The plane made its first flight last week in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` We put fences around the B-2,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` We want to make sure that the plane performs as advertised, both in terms of its flying ability and also in terms of its stealth characteristics, which are crucial.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel supports complete research and development of the V-22, known as the Osprey, but it wants to withhold advanced procurement money until it is determined the tilt-rotor aircraft can be used commercially. The senators want `` to see if someone other than the taxpayer is going to put up some money,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Effect of Mexican Deal on Third World Still Unclear</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The general agreement between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and its creditor banks offers a glimmer of hope to the debt-strapped Third World, but the success of the plan hinges on how far the banks are ultimately willing to go, government officials and private bankers said Monday. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which provided a final push over the weekend to get the agreement, hailed the package as a landmark success for its debt-reduction initiative, unveiled by Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> on March 10. However, the banks that will implement the plan were more reserved in their enthusiasm, with many contending that it was too soon to say how much debt relief they will provide to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> because they were still examining the fine print of the agreement. `` At the moment, we're exploring our options,'' <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitel </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a typical comment. `` We're looking at the entire -LRB- Third World -RRB- debt package.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration hopes to use the Mexican agreement to set a precedent that will facilitate debt relief in other countries, with <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> considered the two leading candidates to follow <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s lead. The administration has made debt reduction a key component of its foreign policy, believing that the only way to insure the survival of emerging democracies in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is to find a way to reverse the decade-long slide in living standards caused by the crushing $ 1.3 trillion Third World debt burden. The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan for debt relief seeks to slash this debt by establishing incentives to get commerical banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of the loans. However, banking analysts said it was unclear whether the incentives being offered in the Mexican package were sufficient to trigger a substantial writedown of the debt. In the case of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the debt-reduction package provides the commercial banks with three options. On the debt-relief side, the banks can cut 35 percent off the face value of the current loans or they can agree to reduce interest rates to 6.25 percent, down from about 10 percent currently. Banks also have the option of simply providing new loans. The administration estimated that the various options could save <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> about $ 1.5 billion annually off the $ 5 billion to $ 5.5 billion it must pay to service its $ 54 billion in commercial bank debt. However, the administration stressed that this was a rough estimate and would vary depending on individual decisions made by the 500 commercial banks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that hold the Mexican debt. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and a leading congressional expert on Third World debt, said that the Mexican agreement appeared seriously flawed because it did not provide enough incentives for banks to opt for the two debt-reduction options rather than simply piling on new debt. `` A lot of the banks, without the necessary carrots or sticks, are going to stick with the familiar -LRB- approach of supplying -RRB- new money to pay old debt,'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said that approach has proven to be a disaster over the last seven years. Since 1982, when the debt crisis first erupted, Third World debt has more than doubled from $ 600 billion to $ 1.3 trillion. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> agreement did not represent any `` long-lasting breakthrough in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt situation.'' He said that, while the amount of debt-reduction was likely to be small, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would benefit in the next couple of years with an infusion of money to get its economy started again. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> DRI-McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, said that the administration apparently failed to get as many concessions as it could from the commercial banks because they were so anxious to get an agreement. `` It looks like they desperately wanted to do a deal and get something signed to prove that their debt strategy could work,'' she said. `` It is a surface agreement that allows the administration to claim a success but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions.'' The administration had hoped that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be able to present a completed Mexican package during the seven-nation economic summit last week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. When that deadline was missed, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> stepped up his lobbying efforts. He brought the bankers and Mexican negotiators to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over the weekend for meetings at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, which were also attended by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. After two days of discussions at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, final agreement was reached late Sunday, in time for Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> to announce the breakthrough during a televised broadcast, saying the proposal would answer the `` the cry of Mexicans to return to growth.''

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Monday lifted 3-week-old censorship restrictions on reporting ethnic violence but told journalists to censor themselves. Also Monday, authorities halted a rally by about 600 <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks who were demanding the expulsion of Indian peacekeeping troops. No violence was reported. The monks' organization, which claims to represent 25,000 members, said it is prepared to join an armed struggle to oust the Indian forces. Monk are an important political force in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The government's announcement that censorship was being lifted came 26 hours after the slaying of its chief censor, <PERSON> Themis </PERSON> <PERSON> Guruge </PERSON>. He was shot to death Sunday while walking near his home. Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, blamed the slaying of <LOCATION> Guruge </LOCATION>, who also headed state-run radio, on Sinhalese extremists. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> informed local newspaper editors that censorship had been lifted, but he also warned them: `` Be more responsible and maintain self-censorship, especially on subversive activities and the Indian issue.'' The censorship had taken heavy criticism from both government and opposition lawmakers. The July 6 announcement of censorship on domestic and foreign press coincided with worsening ethnic violence and a deepening dispute with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> has demanded that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> pull out 40,000 soldiers deployed as a peacekeeping force. President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> has denounced the Indian military presence in his nation as a threat to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s sovereignty and demanded a pullout by the end of July. Indian peacekeepers arrived in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> two years ago at the invitation of <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s predecessor, President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has long said it does not intend to keep its force here indefinitely, but Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has said a premature withdrawal would lead to even more bloodshed. More than 15,000 people have been killed in ethnic violence that started with a separatist revolt by ethnic Tamil guerrillas in 1983. About 11,000 people have died in the Tamil insurrection, including 1,000 Indian soldiers. According to the government, Sinhalese extremists killed 4,000 people _ mostly Sinhalese government officials and supporters _ in a backlash against what they perceived as excessive concessions to the Tamils. The militant Sinhalese have been led by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. During censorship, most references to the front or to Sinhalese radicals were removed from news stories. Tamils, who make up about 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, say they are discriminated against by Sinhalese. The majority Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population, dominating the government and military. During their rally, the saffron-robed monks were defying a ban on such protests. They pushed past a line of police and sat on the narrow lane outside the Sri Mahabodhi Temple in the capital, <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Earlier, their <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bhikkhu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying thousands of monks were prepared to join an armed struggle to preserve Sri Lankan sovereignty from what it called `` the Indian army of invasion.'' Before the rally, a 25-year old monk who declined to give his name told a news conference in the temple compound that the monks' federation had decided to join militant Sinhalese extremists and student groups in opposing the government and the presence of Indian peacekeepers `` We do not believe the Indian army would go back on just a request,'' the monk said. `` We believe that we have to take further action, and we are prepared to do it.'' Asked if the monks condoned violence, he said: `` If an armed struggle is demanded to gain the freedom of the people, the <LOCATION> Bhikku </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Federation </LOCATION> does approve and will participate in it.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it supported a ten-fold increase in the maximum fine for criminal antitrust violations by corporations to $ 10 million. The department, noting it is conducting more than 150 grand jury investigations of alleged criminal antitrust violations, said an increase was needed to deter price fixing, bid rigging and unlawful attempts by corporations to control the market on certain products. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in a statement that he supported legislation pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would increase the maximum fine from $ 1 million to $ 10 million for corporate antitrust violations. `` This increase in penalties will send a strong signal to those who intend to defraud American consumers or the federal government through criminal antitrust conspiracies that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> takes their criminal conduct most seriously and will see that they are appropriately punished,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. He issued the statement on the eve of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing on antitrust issues. The proposal to increase the maximum corporate fine was contained in legislation sponsored by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, R-S.C. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rill </PERSON>, the new assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ` santitrust division, is scheduled to testify at Tuesday's <PERSON> Rill </PERSON> noted in a statement that `` it has been 15 years since criminal fines for coprorate antitrust offenders were raised, and a sizeable increase in fines now is a good way to underscore that this criminal activity will not be tolerated.'' The fines apply to criminal antitrust violations such as price fixing and bid rigging, which <PERSON> Rill </PERSON> noted is `` undertaken purely to defraud its victims and has no possible economic justification.'' <PERSON> Rill </PERSON>, noting that the antitrust division is conducting more than 150 grand jury investigations of suspected criminal violations, said current fines `` do not appear to be adequately deterring this unlawful conduct.''

<TEXT>
 State-run TV on Monday broadcast the government's first documentary account of the events leading up to its bloody suppression of pro-democracy protests in early June The first hour of the four-part series, `` A Test of Blood and Fire,'' was as remarkable for what it left out as for what it included. It did n't show the students singing the national anthem, which they did constantly. It also did n't show posters attacking corruption and nepotism, or banners proclaiming the protesters' love for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Footage shown in the program, unlike earlier official reports, did show Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> hanging in effigy and banners mocking senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. In the first two weeks after the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators June 3-4 that left hundreds or perhaps thousands dead, state-run TV repeatedly showed angry crowds stoning troops and setting army vehicles on fire. Monday's was the first official documentary account of the events leading up to June 3 that purported to put the student movement into perspective. Some events in the documentary were shown out of sequence, apparently to strengthen the government's argument that the student marches were instigated by anti-communist intellectuals. Dissident intellectuals, who remained on the sidelines until the last stages of the protests, were portrayed as speaking to students much earlier than they did. Apparently to support government claims that the student-led protests were orchestrated many months in advance by dissidents such as <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, the program began by showing students discussing democratic reforms at forums last winter. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and his wife, physics professor <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, were shown at that time speaking to the students. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> did not appear in public support of the later protests sparked by the death of former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> in mid-April. After the crackdown, however, they sought refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The Chinese government has demanded they be handed over for arrest. Monday's TV program repeatedly accused <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s successor as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> head, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, of contributing to the `` turmoil'' of the widespread demonstrations. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who was ousted following the crackdown on dissent, has been accused of supporting the student protests and opposing other party leaders who wanted to quash them. Public criticism of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has mounted steadily since his June 24 ouster from his party posts. Several reports of comments <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> allegedly made at closed meetings have been cited to prove his softness on Western-style liberalism, which the government blames for the student movement. An editorial Monday in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> accused <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> of supporting `` words and deeds that vilified Marxism'' and spreading non-Marxist theories. It did not give any specifics.

 President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> became chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and said his top priority is to seek an end to regional conflicts. In a speech to the opening session of the three-day summit, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> also urged the 50-nation group to work together to confront `` racist aggression'' by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and ease <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s debt problem. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> called for the `` enhancement of solidarity for the settlement of the current disputes between various states.'' He mentioned no specific conflicts, but he clearly was referring to the border dispute between <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, the war between <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> over control of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> and recent ethnic clashes among residents of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> did not make any reference to the civil wars in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> that have taken hundreds of thousands of lives. The <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> traditionally does not meddle in what are considered the internal affairs of its members, although many African nations take the view that the rebels battling the government in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> are inspired and backed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> was elected by acclamation to lead the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> for the coming year, succeeding President <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Traore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>. The chairmanship alternates each year between Arab and black African states. The Egyptian president pledged to `` confront firmly and tenaciously the racist aggression'' of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which he accused of trying to undermine <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition toward independence and enslaving its own black people through apartheid, its policy of racial segregation. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> listed <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s economic problems as his third priority, saying they `` constitute a serious danger which not only threatens to stifle development'' but `` also threatens our very existence and survival.'' As he has before, he urged a resumption of talks between the impoverished nations of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the northern industrialized countries. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> also said he would seek greater cooperation between the Arab states of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, saying they share the same principles, values and goals. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told the session that he was encouraged by progress toward ending South African rule of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. But he said some provisions of the independence plan `` have not been fully respected'' by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He specifically cited the incorporation of some members of a disbanded South African counterinsurgency force known as <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> into the legitimate <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> police force. He said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in the region `` has clearly established'' that former <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> members were intimidating civilians in an apparent attempt to influence scheduled elections this fall. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said there `` had been a reduction of intimidation in recent days, but this is not enough. ... There must be full compliance'' with the independence plan. He made no reference to an earlier <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> call for an increase in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force, a call repeated in another speech Monday by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Njuma </PERSON>, the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has been battling <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence for 25 years <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> reportedly rejected any increase in the peacekeeping force after talks with <PERSON> Njuma </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, late last week.

<HEAD>GAO Says Pentagon Fails to Test Planes for Impacts with Birds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite losing nine military aircraft and six crew members to bird collisions over a five-year period, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> still fails to test its planes to see whether they can withstand such impacts, congressional investigators said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigating agency for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, reported that from 1983 through 1987 more than 16,000 collisions occurred. While most caused only minor damage, nine planes _ including a $ 250 million B-1B bomber _ crashed after colliding with birds. Losses for the period totaled $ 318 million. `` If our military aircraft are not ready for birds, how can they be ready for combat?'' asked Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., who requested the study for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which he heads `` The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> did not ask us for a comment and we have n't even seen it,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodanyi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, when asked for reaction to the report. The report's release coincided with opening of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consideration of the future of the new-generation B-2 stealth bomber, at $ 530 million each the most expensive airplane ever built. `` With more expensive aircraft coming into use, such as the B-1B and B-2, the value of these losses could become more significant,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The investigators found that specifications are inconsistent for the ability of airplanes and engines to withstand bird collisions. Where there are specifications for engines, the testing does not accurately reflect the sizes and numbers of birds normally sucked into jet engines, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The military agency has no testing program to see how well airframes _ the plane's body and wings, particularly leading edges _ stand up to bird collisions, investigators said. The report suggested requiring in government contracts that adequate testing be done, and having the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> enforce that requirement, as a way to reduce unnecessary costs.

 The knife-scraped skeletal remains of cannibal <PERSON> Alferd </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>'s victims have been taken to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> for study in an attempt to shed more light on the old story. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> came out of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1874 and said he had subsisted on the remains of five prospecting companions to make it through the winter. The remains of the five were found later that year and buried near here. Anthropologists, who spent a week recovering the bones from a graveyard on Deadman's Gulch, said evidence already indicated that one of the men had been shot and several of the bones had been scraped with a knife. The scholars have taken on the challenge to see if they can determine the real story through scientific detection and see if <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> was wrongly convicted. The recovery crew left Sunday with the remains. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, who was sent to prison after being convicted of manslaughter in the deaths of each man, told authorities he shot only one of the men and hit him in the head with a hatchet in self defense. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> said the man had killed the four others with a hatchet. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON>, curator of physical anthopology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>, said a bullet hole was found in a right pelvic bone Saturday, supporting <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>'s story that he'd shot one of the men in self defense. The bullet hole indicated that the man had been shot from the front. <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON> said two of the skulls were recovered almost complete and other damaged skulls would be reconstructed to see if they will account for at least a partial fifth victim. Scrape marks on the bones of two skeletons indicated they'd been cut and scraped, or `` defleshed,'' <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON> said. Punch marks found in a pelvic bone indicated an animal also had eaten from one of the remains after the spring thaw of 1874, he added. The project includes forensic anthropologists, a forensic pathologist and an expert on fibers and tool marks on bones. <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON> said a laboratory study should indicate whether any of the scraped bones had been cooked over a fire.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> honored 104 people and organizations with `` Take Pride in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' awards Monday for helping preserve the great outdoors. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can only be as beautiful as her people are vigilant,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said during an outdoor ceremony at the White House. Borrowing a line from the poet <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` Today each of you is helping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> sing, through your caring and your sacrifice, and through deeds that are making <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a more pristine and glorious place.'' The winners included businesses, civic groups, schools and individuals, as well as government projects. He singled out volunteers in Page, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, who `` rally every year to clean up the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Glen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> and Navajo Reservation,'' and a 4-H Club called the High Country Cactus Kickers that help preserve archaeological sites in <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, <PERSON> Colo </PERSON>. The awards program is a public-private partnership, with the federal effort spearheaded by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The number of winners has tripled since it began two years ago. Addressing a crowd of several hundred people on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, the campaign's honorary chairwoman, shares his love for the outdoors, although `` she might feel that she's a fishing widow at times.'' Actually, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` she, too, loves to fish. In fact, she's the only person I know who can read and fish at the same time. He added, to groans, `` You might call it reading between the lines.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also quipped, `` Only in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> could they call the office that manages the great outdoors the Department of the Interior.'' Country singer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, who was master of ceremonies for the event, got to sing `` God Bless the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'' on the White House lawn for the second time in four days. He also performed at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s picnic for astronauts last Thursday Perhaps preaching to the choir, <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> told the crowd at the end: `` Remember, the White House grounds belong to us all. Put your trash in designated containers.''

<HEAD>Sakharov Speech Provokes Chinese Delegates at Disarmament Conference</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An international peace and disarmament conference began on a discordant note Monday when two Chinese delegates walked out after Soviet physicist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> called for condemnation of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crackdown on student protesters. `` We can not forgive or disregard the conduct of the Chinese government and we must find ways to demonstrate this attitude,'' the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner said at the opening session of the 39th Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs. The Chinese delegates waited outside the conference room during <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s 45-minute speech, which was largely devoted to Soviet economic and environmental problems. Then one of them, Professor <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhongben </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, confronted the 68-year-old human rights activist. Trembling with emotion, <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> did not understand <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> affairs and had chosen an inappropriate forum for his criticism. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> remained impassive. `` Maybe I do n't understand all the complexities of the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but I think I was right,'' he said later. `` We can build peace through international cooperation _ not by interfering in the internal affairs of other countries,'' said <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>. About 200 scientists and statesmen from more than 30 countries are attending the five-day conference, being held in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the first time in 19 years. The Pugwash conferences grew out of a 1955 statement by <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> calling on scientists of all political persuasions to devise ways to avoid nuclear war. The first conference was held in 1957 at <LOCATION> Pugwash </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. Most of the sessions are devoted to technical arms control issues and are closed to the public. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> spoke during the plenary session, which was also addressed by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the 1950s, later spoke out against Soviet human rights abuses and the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He was banished to internal exile in the industrial city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> from 1979 to 1986, when he was personally called back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Only in the past year has he been allowed to travel to the West. After the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> crushed the pro-democracy protest in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tianenmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on June 3-4 _ with estimates of deaths running as high as 3,000 _ the new <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> issued a guarded statement calling it `` an internal matter.'' But <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, told the Pugwash delegates `` we can not pretend that nothing took place ... The world can not deal with this <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government the way it has in the past.'' Speaking through a translator, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> compared the violence in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s use of poison gas and sharpened shovels to disperse a nationalist demonstration in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in April, killing at least 20 people. He said both events showed the dangers faced by democracy movements around the world. <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>, the senior <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> delegate, stood up about halfway through the speech, as soon as <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> made the remarks about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He was quickly followed by the second delegate, <PERSON> Niu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qiang </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> and Disarmament. Two other Chinese delegates kept their seats in another part of the room, but it was unclear whether they did so deliberately or failed to notice the departure of <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> and Niu. Despite the incident, <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Niu </PERSON> said they planned to attend the rest of the conference, which will explore ways to convert warmer East-West relations into practical agreements on arms control and verification. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Innas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, a nuclear physicist from <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s confrontation with the Chinese did not dampen the optimism of most delegates, who believe the time is ripe for arms accords. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> urged the delegates to take advantage of the Soviet-American rapprochement. `` It may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the unsuccessful <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president.

<TEXT>
 Officials and supporters of the new National Opera were reeling Monday from the death of <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON>, the country's leading opera star, who had agreed to take over as director. The 54-year-old singer, whose bass voice had boomed through opera houses from <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scala </ORGANIZATION> to the Metropolitan, died Saturday. One colleague on Monday called him `` the father figure of Finnish opera.'' News reports said <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON> died during the wedding dance of his youngest daughter on his farm in <LOCATION> Juva </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Savonlinna </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. They indicated he died of a heart attack. His family refused to discuss the cause of death or funeral arrangements. Two months before his death, <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON> agreed to become director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> in 1992 after the opera house is finished. <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON> said his aim would be to make the Finnish opera `` on a par with the best in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Alfons </PERSON> <PERSON> Almi </PERSON>, a leading figure behind the plan to build a new opera, said <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON> was the only real candidate for director. `` The directorship was tailor-made for <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON>. He is irreplaceable,'' <PERSON> Almi </PERSON> said in a newspaper interview Monday. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON>, a member of the committee to select a new director, described <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON>'s death as a `` catastrophe'' for the National Opera. `` It will be very difficult to find a suitable new director,'' <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON>, born Feb. 4, 1935, began his international singing career after winning a contest in <LOCATION> Vaasa </LOCATION>, west <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, in 1960. He had trained to be a school teacher and singing was just a hobby. He then studied singing in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. After a breakthrough at the <PERSON> Bayreuth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> festival, he was signed by the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Deutsche Opera. During his career, <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON> performed more abroad than in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. In addition to the Metropolitan Opera of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Scala </PERSON>, his stages have included the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Bolshoi and the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> National Opera. He was said to have sung all the major opera roles for bass voices. He was particularly acclaimed for his interpretation of the title role of <LOCATION> Mussorgsky </LOCATION>'s opera `` <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Godunov </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON> was artistic director of the annual Savonlinna Opera Festival from 1972 to 1979. He elevated the festival to a major international opera event. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gronroos </PERSON>, current artistic director of the festival, said <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON>'s `` uncompromising nature was precisely the reason why he was able to create such great art.'' `` In <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON>, we have lost a visionary, the father figure of Finnish opera,'' <PERSON> Gronroos </PERSON> said. Not long before he died, <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON> was asked about his reputed stubborn streak. `` Nobody can ever force me to do anything, but I am always prepared to negotiate,'' he said. When not working, <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON> spent much of his time at his summer retreat in <LOCATION> Juva </LOCATION>, where he tended a flock of 100 sheep. <PERSON> Talvela </PERSON> is survived by his wife of 32 years, <PERSON> Annukka </PERSON>, and by three adult children.

 Pipe bombs blasted an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> recruiting station and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> post office Monday, authorities said. A telephone caller claimed the two bombs were planted by a pro-independence group. There were no reports of injuries from the blasts, which came on the eve of Puerto Rico Constitution Day. The holiday celebrates the 37-year-old Constitution that made the island a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth. A series of similar bomb attacks have struck the island in recent months. Monday's caller told a radio station the bombs were placed by the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Forces, a little-known group. Police could not confirm the authenticity of the call. The male caller, who did not give his name, said the bombing was to protest military bases in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and its Commonwealth status. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provides defense for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, and its only military bases are American. The Pentagon has 3,350 active servicemen on the island, including 2,000 at the <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roads </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> on the west coast. Police said the Monday's bombs went off at 2 a.m. at the <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> about 10 miles east of metropolitan <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. They caused `` considerable'' damage to the Army recruiting office, the post office and several public telephones, all on the interior of the shopping center, police said. They also damaged the administrative offices of the Pueblo Supermarket, which faces the parking lot. Police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents were investigating. Two bombs went off last week at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> post offices in <LOCATION> Coamo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guayama </LOCATION>, municipalities in the island's interior. No injuries were reported. In June, the <ORGANIZATION> Borinquen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, also known as the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION> or machete-wielders, claimed responsibility for a bomb that caused heavy damage but no injuries at an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> recruiting station and a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bayamon </LOCATION>. The town is about 15 miles northwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Borinquen </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s name before the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> conquest of the island in the 16th century. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> ceded the island to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1898. Similar explosions, with no injuries and only minor damage, occurred in June at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs office in the southern city of <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION> and at a <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> branch in <LOCATION> Caguas </LOCATION>, about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. No group claimed responsibility for those blasts. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION> is a militant pro-independence group that has been relatively inactive in recent years. During the 1970s, it blew up five <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> fighter jets worth $ 47 million and ambushed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vehicle, killing two sailors and injuring 10. Sixteen suspected members were charged in the $ 7 million robbery of a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, in 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> charges that the Macheteros intended to use the money to pay for their campaign to gain independence for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Government troops Monday launched an offensive on suspected guerrilla hideouts on the outskirts of the capital and seized large amounts of weaponry, a spokesman said. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, U.S.-backed guerrillas said government fighter jets blasted villages north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> after residents refused to pressure guerrillas to open a key stretch of highway used to carry in supplies from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said soldiers conducted search operations at four areas to the west, east and southwest of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` The operation is still continuing and our brave soldiers are successfully recovering arms and ammunition,'' he said. Mortar shells, anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, rockets and ammunition were recovered, he said. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> did not mention any fighting during the operation. The offensive comes after the Moslem guerrillas launched 19 rockets into the city over the weekend, killing 46 people and wounding 121 others. At least 43 people were killed Saturday when the guerrillas launched eight rockets. The barrage resumed Sunday when 11 rockets landed in the city, killing three people. Also Monday, a bomb exploded in a restaurant in the city center, injuring at least seven people. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Faizullah </PERSON>, a restaurant employee said the bomb made a deep crater on the floor, shattered window panes and destroyed furniture. `` Had the bomb exploded during lunch or dinner time, many people would have died,'' he said. The blast took place in the afternoon, he said, when few people were in the restaurant. The guerrillas were believed responsible for the explosion, but no arrests were reported. <PERSON> Fazle </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON>, of the pro-rebel Afghan Information and Documentation Centre in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, said that since Friday, government planes blasted the villages of <LOCATION> Shakardara </LOCATION>, Mir <PERSON> Bacha </PERSON> <PERSON> Kot </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Qara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bagh </LOCATION>, along a 35 mile stretch of the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> north of the Afghan capital. There was no estimate of damage or casualty figures and the report could not be independently confirmed. <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> said the attacks came after Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, in a meeting Friday, was unable to persuade elders from villages north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to put pressure on the guerrillas to stop attacking supply convoys. The guerrillas, also based in neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, have been fighting the Soviet-backed government for the past 11 years. They control most of the countryside and the government's army has maintained control of the cities after a Soviet troop pullout was completed in February. At least 1 million Afghans have been killed in the war.

<TEXT>
 Burmese forces launched a fierce assault on ethnic <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> rebels near the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border, but they were forced to retreat, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> police said Monday. At least 44 people were reported killed. The border police and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> sources said the dead included 42 government soldiers. They said only two rebels were killed and one was wounded. The attack was the heaviest and most sustained since Burmese troops began their assault on the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> base of <LOCATION> Kaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ra </LOCATION> in May, the police said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Burmese troops began pounding the base with mortar fire Saturday before launching the infantry assault, police said. They pulled back Sunday after taking heavy casualties, they said. Police said the camp, about five miles from the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border town of <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sot </LOCATION>, is defended by about 1,200 Karens. There was no indication how many Burmese troops were involved in the attack. The Karens, with about 8,000 fighters, are the largest of 12 ethnic minority groups that have fought a four-decade war for greater autonomy from the central government. Kaw Moo Ra, situated along a curve of the <LOCATION> Moei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, can be attacked from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> only with artillery or by a frontal assault on a well-defended 250-yard strip of land between the two bends in the river. Thai gunners fired 15 warning shots at a <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government mortar base in hills near the camp after about 80 mortar rounds fell inside <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> territory at the village of <LOCATION> Ban </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kaew </LOCATION>, police said. Burmese troops burned the Thai village at the end of May, when they intruded into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to attack Kaw Moo Ra from the rear. Last year, the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> army began a campaign to dislodge the Karens from riverbank strongholds where they have controlled cross-border trade. Burmese troops have seized five key bases since December. The Burmese government wants to clear routes through Karen-controlled territory to allow the passage of export goods, mainly timber, into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The Karens say the government has paid a heavy price for its victories. They claim to have killed at least 2,000 government soldiers and wounded 4,000. They gave no total for their own casualties. Thai border forces said earlier in the campaign that <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> casualties were much lighter than those of the government.

<TEXT>
 Army investigators Monday tried to find the cause of a helicopter crash that killed six men during desert training exercises. There was no immediate word on whether the pilot of the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter was wearing night-vision goggles of a type that has been criticized as a safety threat, said Maj. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagstaffe </PERSON>, a base spokesman. The helicopter crashed at 4 a.m. Saturday as its crew was directing other aircraft in a mock attack in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. `` It is standard procedure for crews to wear night vision goggles while on missions of that type here,'' said <PERSON> Wagstaffe </PERSON>. `` But whether this crew was wearing them will have to be determined by the investigation.'' The goggles have come under criticism recently because, among other things, they significantly narrow a pilot's field of vision. They were originally designed for ground troop use. The goggles were used by pilots during crashes that have killed 150 servicemen and destroyed 69 helicopters since 1978, according to one newspaper investigation. Three officers and three non-commissioned officers died in the crash. A corporal suffered a broken leg, the Pentagon said. All the soldiers aboard were from the 1st Cavalry Division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. They were at the 1,000-square-mile base for a three-week exercise that coincidentally ended Saturday. The accident occurred while 1st Cavalry troops waged mock battle against units posing as Soviet forces at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Irwin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, with the Blackhawk crew directing two Apache AH-64 assault helicopters. A team from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rucker </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, will be on the scene for at least a week, and the investigation will likely conclude in three to four months, said <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanks </PERSON> in a telephone interview. The Safety Center has the power to ground the $ 4.6 million UH-60, but they remained flying on Monday. The Army's fleet of 820 UH-60s was grounded twice in May 1987, once for inspection and once because of a design flaw. The entire fleet also was grounded in April 1985 and March 1986 after fatal crashes. In 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> identified a defect in the main rotor assembly and ordered it corrected. Blanks said the crash was the fourth of a UH-60 since October. There were five such accidents last fiscal year, he said, adding: `` There is no abnormal trend, not when you consider the amount of hours they fly.'' The colonel said no repeated structural flaws have been found. `` The majority of our accidents are human error,'' he said. The two-engine Blackhawk is designed as a utility and assault aircraft. It normally is operated with a crew of three and can carry 11 combat-equipped soldiers. It is made by <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, those killed in the crash were identified as Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittingstall </PERSON>, 40, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; Capt <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, 33, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; 1st Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 26, <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; Chief Warrant Officer 4 <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westbrook </PERSON>, 42, <LOCATION> Poteet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; Chief Warrant Officer 3 <PERSON> Adelbert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, 41, <LOCATION> Hemet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; and Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 28, <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s top <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders arrived Monday to inform Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about plans for multiparty elections, according to official reports. <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> were invited by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after a change in the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> party leadership last month. The party set up a four-man presidium dominated by reformers and elevated <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> to the newly influential post of party chairman. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> maintained his position as party general secretary. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> is responsible for internal party matters, and <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> is responsible for the party's foreign relations. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> this month in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> at a meeting of the seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries. The Soviet Foreign Ministry's deputy spokesman, <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON>, said the talks were part of an increasingly frequent discussion of reforms in the two countries. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the Hungarians will inform <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s decision to allow a pluralistic system, according to a foreign policy aide to <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmer </PERSON> The party is negotiating with the opposition on the first multiparty elections since the Communists consolidated power in 1948. Elections are due by June 1990. In <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thurmer </PERSON> told the party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> the visit was aimed at exchanging information on recent developments in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` It is worth examining how the processes taking place in the two countries strengthen each other,'' <PERSON> Thurmer </PERSON> said. `` The Soviet party shows understanding toward the introduction of a multiparty system in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.'' On Saturday, the first opposition candidate in more than 41 years was elected in a local by-election to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Communist-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> and Hungarian Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> _ also elevated to the party four-man presidium along with reformer <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> _ visited <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in March and returned with assurances of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s reforms. Reforms began earlier in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and have progressed further than in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, making it both a laboratory for economic and social experiments in the Soviet bloc and an occasional source of worry for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> over whether they are going too far. Visiting <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> this month, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also expressed support for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s reforms but emphasized that he did not wish to interfere. <PERSON> Thurmer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> visit would also be discussed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 A city that has trouble paying for trash collection has been billed for hundreds of unauthorized long-distance telephone calls. The cash-starved city's monthly bills average $ 5,000 and include calls to virtually every state, the <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> -RRB- News-Democrat reported Sunday. Many phones in the police and maintenance departments logged calls to `` 900'' prefix lines, the paper said. The `` 900'' lines are used by dial-a-porn and adult talk services, as well as by businesses conducting polls or giving out product and other information. None of the `` 900'' numbers on city bills was in service when called by the paper. Treasurer <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the number of questionable calls in each month's two-inch-thick bill shows the need for an internal auditor. `` After I suggested it to the -LRB- aldermanic -RRB- council two years ago, they cut my staff in half,'' she said. A continuing cash crunch has made it hard for the city to pay salaries and collect garbage in recent months. In a review of bills from March, April and May, the paper found hundreds of dollars worth of calls from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and other places were charged to the city either by reversing the charges or by using a city credit card number. Many outgoing calls from City Hall were equally questionable. There were calls to a trivia line that gives callers a chance to win prizes, to the Dunes Hotel in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, and to a pay phone in a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> hospital. And there were at least 16 calls from a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> number to the beeper of a man convicted on Friday on charges of running a cocaine ring.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still stands behind <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, his embattled nominee to be the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top civil rights enforcer, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> lawyer as `` someone who would be a fighter for civil rights; a black person who understood the black experience.'' He said <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> also was `` someone who knew urban problems, someone who was willing to take charge in that job and do it with aggressiveness and forcefulness. We think <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> will do that.'' The former sheriff of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, is opposed by many civil rights groups who claim he lacks experience to be assistant attorney general for civil rights. They also have criticized his defense of recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions on civil rights. Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which could vote on the nomination as early as Thursday, expressed doubts about <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> following his testimony at confirmation hearings last week. A prominent black in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., withdrew his support for the nominee following the hearing And <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Monday urged <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., to reject <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> as being `` unsuitable'' for the post <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in a letter to <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, said he considered <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> an `` outstanding person and family man,'' but without qualifications to run a major legal operation. `` Today, racial discrimination is defended, not by dogs and hoses, but by onerous burdens of proof, severe statutes of limitations, discovery restrictions and procedural trickery. ... We do n't need someone who has never performed surgery operating on the civil rights of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, `` could, despite the best of intentions, seriously harm the cause of civil rights. ... We need an aggressive response to the cutbacks in civil rights. In my judgment, Mr. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> can not provide that response.'' But supporters countered that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' stand on civil rights is the same as that of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said criticisms that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> does not have a civil rights background or legal expertise are `` unjustified'' and `` miss the point.'' He said the head of the civil rights division has a battery of lawyers to assist him in court and to free him for the task of setting civil rights policy. `` Ninety percent of the complaints filed with the civil rights division's criminal section involve police misconduct. Who in this country is better equipped than <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> _ the former policeman, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and county sheriff _ to deal with these tough issues with real experience,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowrey </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, called the opposition to <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> `` partisan and picayune.'' `` I think he is qualified,'' <PERSON> Lowrey </PERSON> said as he left a meeting Monday with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. `` He has as much courtroom experience as <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had when he was nominated to be attorney general over the whole <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Lowrey </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to `` work to alter and influence the administration's position'' on civil rights once confirmed as assistant attorney general. `` We still think <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is a good candidate, an excellent candidate and should be confirmed, on the basis of his experience, his ability, the work that he's done, the fact that he has labored in the vineyards of law enforcement and civil rights, that he knows these problems from the inside of a big city,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We stand behind the candidate,'' he said. Asked about a comment by a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, that civil rights groups opposing the <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> nomination `` have the most to lose'' from their stance, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not plan to hold this against them. `` The president made this appointment in good faith. He thinks it's a good appointment. He expects to maintain good relations with the civil rights groups no matter what,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> has been nominated to the job that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> held in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s point man in implementing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s conservative legal agenda at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Civil rights groups complained <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> undermined affirmative action.

 <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> had a dream football team last fall, but questions about academic eligibility and the arrest of several players for robbery have brought more shame than glory to the school. The talented Cowboys were on their way to the state championship last fall when they were initially disqualified three weeks before the playoffs. Star senior running back <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> had allegedly failed algebra. State education officials and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interscholastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> accused <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> C.C </PERSON>. <PERSON> Russeau </PERSON> of changing <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' grade to passing, a charge that <PERSON> Russeau </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> school superintendent repeatedly denied With a temporary court order, the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> went on to win the championship, and the matter went to court. Then a new bombshell dropped in June: <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and another All-American Cowboy teammate, <PERSON> Derric </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, were charged in several armed robberies. Next, three other teammates were among five more <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> students charged in the robberies of small businesses and restaurants. A state district judge ruled last Tuesday in favor of <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> in the grade dispute, meaning the high school keeps the football title. But the criminal charges remain. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> have pleaded guilty and await sentencing. Cases are pending against the other players, who include members of the basketball and junior varsity football teams. Now disbelieving parents, students and teammates are struggling to figure out why athletes with such promise turned to crime. And some observers say the students were never prepared to handle the attention created by their success in sports. The 1,700-student school sits in a middle-class neighborhood. The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that friends and other students said the arrested players robbed to make up for gambling losses and because of a hunger for status and money. The Carter football players slipped from athletics into friendly dice games and then into gambling for easy money, students and adults told the Morning News in a copyright story. When the athletes learned that playing dice was also an easy way to lose money, some turned to armed robbery, the students said. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, one of the alleged robbery ringleaders, said Friday that gambling `` probably'' was the motive for the first holdups. `` Then,'' he said, `` it went on for kicks.'' Recouping losses `` was n't a motivation for me, but it was for others,'' another player said through his attorney. `` Some of us just wanted money for partying and buying things.'' Gambling was so common among athletes at Carter that some coaches tolerated it and the Student Council, fearing violence, condemned it, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> `` P.K.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who on Friday pleaded guilty with <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> to the group's first holdup, said through their attorneys that they robbed to win acceptance by their friends. `` He wanted to be held in that high esteem and he had to be as tough as they were,'' attorney <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Calisi </PERSON> said of his client, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. `` He did that to stay with the crowd.'' <PERSON> Derric </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> have publicly apolgized for their deeds. `` When I put myself in the position of those I robbed, looking at a weapon, I can imagine how terrified they felt,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> directed part of his statement to his mother and father. `` You do n't deserve the disappointment, the embarrasment and the shame that I've brought on you. I do n't expect you to stand behind me for what I've done, but please find it in your heart to forgive me,'' he said. <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> president, said she hopes students can put the dark clouds behind them this school year. `` If everybody would just let it die, it would make things a lot easier. We were and still are the brunt of a lot of jokes,'' she said. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> parent <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkin </PERSON> said the crimes are `` very unfortunate,'' but do n't merit the `` incessant barage of media'' attention, which he called `` sensationalism.'' Coach <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> was vacationing in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last week and could not be reached by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Russeau </PERSON> did not return phone calls to the AP. Linebacker <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstead </PERSON> said <PERSON> James </PERSON> was tough on academics and discipline as well as football and could n't be blamed for the misbehavior of his players. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, said he thinks the 17-year-old got involved in the robberies because of pressure over the grade dispute. `` When this controversy started, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> should have received some counseling,'' West said. He said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> is working at a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant, `` getting his life back together.'' Because of the criminal charges, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> lost financial aid offered by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> sports psychologist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McGaffey </PERSON> said the entire team could have used counseling. `` Prominence gives a feeling of power. And if it happens suddenly and without the development of discipline and responsibility ... they're in for trouble,'' <PERSON> McGaffey </PERSON> said. `` We forget the fact that a 17-year-old or 18-year-old is still a kid in our culture,'' he said.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has held meetings with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporters from the occupied territories despite a government ban on contacts with the outlawed group, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources said Monday. The reports were denied by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, and by Palestinians identified as meeting with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the premier `` does not meet with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members and does not conduct negotiations directly or indirectly with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' He confirmed <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has met `` non-PLO Palestinians'' from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in recent weeks, but said, `` I do n't know what they believe in their hearts.'' He declined to identify the participants. Also on Monday, an Arab attacker shot to death one Palestinian and wounded another in front of <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. Both victims were suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The army confirmed the shootings but said it was checking the circumstances. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, soldiers shot and killed <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Arda </PERSON>, 22, in a clash between troops and youths in <LOCATION> Araba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Monday's <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> attack brings to 84 the number of Palestinians killed as alleged collaborators during the 19-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arda </PERSON> was the 519th Palestinian to die in confrontations with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and civilians. Thirty-eight Israelis also have been killed. In scattered stone-throwing confrontations with troops in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 11 Palestinians were shot and wounded by soldiers Monday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the reports. The mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said senior <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> official <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Terasov </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> soon to discuss <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s peace plan. An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said he could not confirm the report, but noted <PERSON> Terasov </PERSON> would be the highest-ranking Soviet to visit since <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> severed ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Terasov is Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s new adviser on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> affairs. The reports alleging <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is meeting pro-PLO activists came as the premier faces a challenge from hard-liners in his <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc who fear he will make too many concessions to win approval to hold elections in the territories to calm the uprising. They also surfaced as <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was quoted in the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> daily <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Messaggero </PERSON> as saying the Israeli government has opened direct contacts with his group. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also said a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee member met recently in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> with an envoy of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. He gave no details. The Austrian news agency <ORGANIZATION> APA </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Razzak </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Yahya </PERSON> and Israeli <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Halali </PERSON> both attended a July 1-2 symposium in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Halali </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> central committee member, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` I did n't meet with anyone at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> conference.'' Palestinian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources who demanded anonymity said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyash </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Shawwa </PERSON>, son of the late <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Rashad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Shawwa </PERSON>. The independent Hebrew daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that another of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> was attorney <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarifi </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> daily reported <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> met an unidentified east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> journalist who supports <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction. Other reports said the fourth participant was <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> pharmacist <PERSON> Ezziddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Aryan </PERSON>. All are known supports of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Al-Aryan </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, its parliament-in-exile. <PERSON> Al-Shawwa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al-Aryan </PERSON> both denied meeting <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. The others could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> in April announced a peace plan calling for elections in the occupied territories to select Palestinians to open talks to negotiate an interim solution. The plan was seen as a vehicle around the government ban on <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> contacts, since many elected undoubtedly would be <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> backers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are trying to persuade <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to approve the plan. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Messaggero </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> approved meetings with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials and has been receiving reports on the contacts. However, underground leaders of the uprising condemned them. `` The unified leadership confirms its rejection of holding any communications with any official representatives in the Israeli government and confirms that not one of the national personalities met with any government officials,'' they said in a leaflet Sunday.

<HEAD>Commodity Spending Less Than Anticipated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal spending on major commodity programs is down from what administration budget analysts forecast in January, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysis showed Monday. Total outlays in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 are now projected at less than $ 13.5 billion, about $ 360 million below the January prediction. Programs include payments to farmers for participating in annual crop programs. In the case of major crops, such as wheat, corn and cotton, the programs provide price supports and other benefits in return for taking land out of production. But some other commodities also are covered, including price support operations for soybeans, peanuts, tobacco, honey, sugar, dairy products and wool. Outlays for corn and other feed grains in 1989 were indicated in January at about $ 3.04 billion. The new `` mid-session review'' raised the estimate to $ 4.17 billion. At the same time, spending for wheat, rice and upland cotton programs was reduced by more than $ 1.3 billion from the January forecast. Allowing for adjustments in other programs administered by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, total spending for the various agricultural commodities was reduced a net of $ 86 million to less than $ 7.03 billion for this fiscal year. Other CCC spending, including $ 3.75 billion for aid to farmers who suffered severe losses from the 1988 drought, put the fiscal 1989 total at just under $ 13.5 billion, compared with the January estimate of more than $ 13.8 billion. Looking at 1990, the report said total CCC spending could drop to just over $ 11.3 billion, down $ 231 million from what was projected in January. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> budget analyst, said the boost in feed-grain outlays from the level initially projected was a result of new quarterly grain inventory figures in January. Those showed more feed grain on hand than had been indicated previously. It was this larger inventory that `` we did not take into account when we did the budget'' that was published by the out-going <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Jan. 9 and later adopted by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he said. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> said in an interview that the Jan. 9 projections were based on supply-and demand readings last November. The new review took into consideration the grain figures that were issued Jan. 13. Looking at fiscal 1990, which will begin Oct. 1, the new report showed total CCC outlays at less than $ 11.4 billion, down about $ 231 million from what had been projected in January. Spending on feed grains in 1989-90 was indicated at nearly $ 7.07 billion, up from the $ 5.56 billion projected in January. Declines from the January projections were shown for wheat, rice and cotton.

<HEAD>Governors Agree To Clean Oceans, But With No Specifics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The governors of eight <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states met with congressional environmental leaders Monday and then signed a broadly worded agreement to work for clean oceans. Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., acknowledged that the document, which was passed from governor to governor while homestate television cameras rolled, `` probably will not take its place between the <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carta </ORGANIZATION> and the Mayflower Compact. But he joined other participants at a news conference following the closed meeting in saying the agreement was a symbolic achievement that signaled the governors were determined to work among themselves and with federal officials to solve environmental problems. Standing behind <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, last year's Democratic presidential nominee, <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> said it will take billions of dollars just to clean up <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> alone and that the main measure of success for the governors' `` coastal agenda'' will be `` the number of dollars we are able to put behind them. The bipartisan meeting, attended by about a dozen members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was arranged by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, also a Democrat. The governors of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> also attended the ceremony. The document specifically did not endorse any of the many pieces of federal legislation pending on environmental issues and purposely was worded vaguely enough to ensure unanimous support. For example, the first section of the five-part plan _ `` Create an Environmental Ethic'' _ says `` Federal and state policies must reflect the need for strengthened environmental protection'' and `` Education and public participation must be strenghtened to show how everyone can participate in the solution to coastal pollution problems.'' The document also called for strengthening research and monitoring of coastal waters; reducing coastal nutrient and toxic pollution; protection of marine and coastal sediment quality; and expansion of government authority for oil spill prevention and response. `` This is the beginning,'' <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> of the meeting. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the most important aspect of the agreement was its call for creation of an environmental ethic because significant progress will not be made `` until the ethic becomes strong enough for force funding. Pressed to estimate how much money would be needed to accomplish the goals of the group, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, `` There is no single overall figure and I think it is a mistake to view it in the context of those kind of questions.'' He emphasized that there was no attempt to get the group to agree on specific legislation and added: `` I think it is very significant that we got started and got the agreement that we did.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has declined to prosecute a former <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> official in connection with his activities for a charity whose donors included many developers who did business with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. The decision was made last week but not disclosed until Monday when a copy of a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> letter informing <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general of the decision was released by a congressman In the letter, the department said it has declined to prosecute <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> for any actions detailed in the inspector general's April report on the agency's Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program. The report detailed numerous instances in which former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials have reaped benefits from the program either as developers or consultants and said many other developers who won lucrative subsidies under the program were donors to FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a Michigan-based charity <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> helped found. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recently that he found no evidence of criminal activity during his office's review of the program But the inspector general referred the report to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION> for a review of whether <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> violated <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s conduct standards by associating himself with the charity, including occasional references to his official position on invitations to FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> events. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> has repeatedly denied any connection between his <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> decisions and donations to the charity. Attempts to reach him Monday for comment were not immediately successful. In releasing the July 19 letter, Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., said he was not criticizing the department for declining to prosecute <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> but took issue with a passage in the letter he said indicated the department would not independently investigate abuses at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` Should you come to obtain information not contained in your report implicating Mr. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> or other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials in possible criminal violations we would be happy to review that information,'' <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said in the passage <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> referred to. `` Call me if you find anything wrong,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said was the attitude the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was adopting. He praised new <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> for seeking to reform the agency but added: `` Elsewhere in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration we are not getting the same kind of commitment to clean this mess up.''

<TEXT>
 A special team of investigators is looking into how so many passengers survived the DC-10 crash in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, with an eye to increasing the chances of both adults and children of living through a crash. The `` survival factors team'' led by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> board investigators has interviewed 26 of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232's passengers so far, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said Monday. Most were among those still hospitalized after Wednesday's crash landing in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that killed 111 people, <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said. Questionnaires will be sent to all adults among the 185 survivors, the investigation spokesman said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said the team will `` document the survivability of the accident'' and try to find out what precautions were most effective in preventing injury and death when the jetliner burst into flames, flipped over, landed on its back and split apart in a cornfield near the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> airport. The team will try to interview all adults traveling with children to see what happened to the youngsters after the pilot told passengers to prepare for a crash landing. Among concerns to be addressed, he said, is the fact that several infants were traveling free in their parents' arms without assigned seats _ a common practice on domestic flights. At least one infant was among the dead, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said investigators have not determined exactly how many of the passengers on Flight 232 from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> were children or infants or how many children were among the dead. A list compiled by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> shows 24 children under 10 years old, including seven under 5, among the survivors. The safety board in 1983 recommended that standards be adopted for infants' seats on airliners. In 1984 the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> drew up standards for seats that can be used in both airliners and cars, but they are not required. In addition to board employees, the survival factors team includes members from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the airline, the engine manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the aircraft manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and others participating in the overall inquiry.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appealed Monday for patience and understanding of turmoil in his homeland, but warned that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does n't tolerate pressure or interference. `` At present, the important thing is not to interfere in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs, particularly when it is in difficulty Do not make things more difficult,'' Ambassador <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> told a packed luncheon meeting of the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. <PERSON> Han </PERSON> said the public comments were his first `` since those terrible developments occurred in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' referring to bloody student uprisings in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> seven weeks ago. He also said they would be his last public comments as ambassador. At age 65 and after two decades of active involvement in U.S.-China relations, he said he is retiring and will soon retur to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Han </PERSON> said he would leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with mixed feelings, but remained confident that the dramatic progress in relations between the two countries would survive the current strain. He said <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has shown restraint in reacting to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions over the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's quelling of the protests. Chinese officials have said 300 people died during the crackdown, but witnesses and Western intelligence sources say the number was in the thousands. The government has also executed dozens of people who allegedly participated. `` Where the question of state sovereignty is concerned, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> always stands firm. To put pressure on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is not the way to talk business. `` It is unwise. It never works, and it can only end up hurting the mutual interests of both countries,'' Han said. `` There is much talk of imposing further economic sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he added. `` Such sanctions must be firmly rejected. They hurt the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as much as they hurt <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The only effect on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that I can think of is that would push back <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> into the isolation of the old days. I am sure that it is not a prospect that you want to see.'' Han, ambassador since 1985, said he did n't expect to make many converts to his government's view of the uprisings, which it characterizes as the work of a very small traitorous mob. <PERSON> Han </PERSON> said Americans and others should look at the context of the turmoil. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is undergoing massive economic reforms, trying to overcome backward industry, illiteracy problems, lack of arable land for its 1.1 billion people and new problems of bureaucratic corruption and speculators. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has made great economic progress in the past decade, he said, and that has led to inflation, increased expectations and economic disparities that also create political turmoil. Because of the changes it is attempting, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government `` places so much emphasis upon the maintenance of order and unity and ... must respond vigorously to signs of chaos and turmoil,'' he said. <PERSON> Han </PERSON> said the friendship between <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> and Chinese is historical and is important to both countries. `` Let's be guided by the forces of history and reason from this time forward. An ancient Chinese wise man once said: ` Spilt water can not be gathered up.''' Han drew 548 people, by far the largest crowd in the Forum Club's 17-year history, said executive director <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> and other nearby colleges all have Chinese student contingents, and the club hired several security guards for possible protests. `` We have not had even a hint of protest,'' said <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>. `` Not oral or otherwise.'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Feustel </PERSON>, of the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said displeasure with the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> violence should n't be allowed to ruin relations. `` We are all mad, boiling mad,'' he said. `` But you have to look to the future.''

<HEAD>Byrd Proposes Plan He Says Could Prevent Influence-Peddling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> proposed a plan Monday he said could prevent influence-peddling situations such as those under investigation at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, wants all those requesting federal funds to report the name of any lobbyists paid to help get the government grant, contract, cooperative agreement loan, loan guarantee or loan If any of the federal money is used to pay someone for personal influence, unrelated to the merits of the project, the grant or loan recipient would be fined $ 100,000. `` Had this legislation been in place it would have been a deterrent in relation to things that happened at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. His proposal was approved Monday by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee as an amendment to the appropriations bill for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and related agencies. It still must be approved by the full committee, the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and go through a conference committee including members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. It was not part of the House legislation. `` This is not an anti-lobbying bill,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. It does n't prohibit payments `` to consultants for professional or other technical services in connection with meeting requirements'' for receiving the grants or loans, he said. `` But when the consultant goes beyond that to get the contract'' there will be trouble, said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. He spoke critically of information he had received about consultants who are knowledgeable about government programs, design grant proposals and then go shopping for a university or other institution willing to apply for the money and pay them for the proposal. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said his plan would affect all government agencies. He called the reporting aspect the best part of the plan. `` It will alert people up and down the line,'' he said. `` It establishes a data base that can be analyzed.'' Twice a year, the federal agencies granting money would be required to file with the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the clerk of the House complete lists of the lobbyists' names, addresses, amounts paid and the purposes for which they were paid. The lists would be available to the public and will be examined by the inspector general's office, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Secretary Calls For `Revolution;' Analyst Says Car Still King</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> called on Monday for a `` revolution in transportation,'' possibly including high-speed rail systems, but a private analyst said the car will remain king. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> launched a series of nationwide hearings aimed at drawing up a national transportation policy for rail, highway, air and water travel. Meetings are to be held in large and small cities throughout the country through mid-September. The first one, in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> auditorium, featured the heads of some of the country's biggest airline, railroad and automobile companies and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, who said the whole system is a `` handyman's special.'' If the nation's system of roads, rails, waterways and airports were listed in a real estate ad, she said, it would say: `` Lots of potential, oldstyle craftsmanship with many modern conveniences, but needs work, a real fixer-upper.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who moderated the first session and will attend some of the other meetings, said a decision to build high-speed rail systems is one possible result of the effort. This could include trains that travel up to 300 mph, particularly between cities where air travel has reached maximum levels. `` It is time for a new revolution in transportation, and hopefully it will be a peaceful revolution,'' said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. In an interview prior to the meeting, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the nation's airports, highways, bridges, waterways and mass transit systems are simply wearing out `` We're going to have to rebuild it and replace it, or we're not going to be able to rely on it anymore,'' he said. Among the most critical problems, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, are a lack of planning for new airports and neglect of $ 80 billion worth of work needed on deteriorating bridges. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, senior research fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, told the opening session that no new system is in the wings that will revolutionize transportation within the next 25 years, so old systems have to be made more efficient. He said the fastest growth is in suburban areas as urban density continues to decline and automobile use increases. The <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> is a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank that has studied several national issues, including transportation needs. `` The country has become ever more tied to its personal, on-demand, point-to-point transportation system: automobiles,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. `` Despite oil shortages and price increases, the lamentations of many environmentalists and urban planners, and multi-billion dollar federal investments in urban transit, nothing has dented the dominance of the automobile,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and other companies are studying `` smart cars and smart highways'' that would be computerized for increased safety and efficiency. In the meantime, he said, some simple things can be done to improve road travel in many areas: traffic light coordination, improved toll road payment procedures, and clearer and brighter highway signs and markings. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is inviting citizens with ideas about how to move Americans in the 21st Century _ and about how to pay for the changes _ to attend the hearings around the country or to send written proposals to the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The transportation secretary said he does n't want the sessions to turn into a littany of complaints. `` You should n't go if you're just going to say, ` We've got gridlock, somebody ought to do something about it,' because we know that,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. `` These are needs and idea sessions.'' The first meeting outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will be held in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, on Tuesday, with the focus on rural transportation issues. The last meetings will be in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Sept. 11-12 and will deal with drug and alcohol use in the commercial transportation system and federal research and development.

 A former federal housing official said Monday that after joining a private law firm she was shown a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> internal document affecting one a client but she denied receiving special treatment because of her friendship with a top aide to then-HUD Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> asked someone `` to show it to me,'' <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told a congressional subcommittee when asked how she was able to read a sensitive <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> document before it was signed by <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. But when asked whether it would be fair to say her close friendship with Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> helped her receive access to internal <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> information, Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> angrily replied: `` I do n't think that's a fair characterization.'' A Republican member of the subcommittee, Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., criticized Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> for hiring Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> as a consultant not long after Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> left the housing agency `` I'm beginning to feel there is a quid pro quo,'' <PERSON> Shays </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said she did not believe there was anything improper about hiring Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. `` She was a good friend,'' she said later when asked about their personal relationship.

Influence was the central topic Monday, with panel members, Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and a second witness, Republican National Committeeman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, sparring in combative verbal exchanges often laced with sarcasm and cynicism. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, detailed at length his lobbying on behalf of the city of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> and a variety of developers, and he defended his use of national party stationery to write letters to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials seeking funding for his clients. `` I found nothing wrong with letting people know who I am,'' said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Shays </PERSON> said the panel's goal was to rid <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of such influence peddling, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> retorted: `` Good luck'' and added `` I did n't invent it.'' `` I wish you were a Democrat,'' Republican <PERSON> Shays </PERSON> said. `` I am embarrassed. ... You cashed in on your party.'' Among those <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> wrote to were <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s executive assistant who, according to testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials, was considered by many as `` de facto secretary'' as far as many funding decisions were concerned in her more than three years in the post Notes from Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> that have been obtained by the subcommittee show that a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> project for which <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had lobbied was on her list for funding under the agency's Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program. Also on Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s approval list for the date April 7, 1987, according to the notes released by the subcommittee, were 200 units for `` <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> is a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator who as an attorney has lobbied <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of developers. Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney who since leaving <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 has had extensive dealings with the agency. She said that in the summer of 1985 while her law firm was representing a client in HUD-related matters, she was shown a draft of a letter <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was preparing to send to <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a major lender in a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> coinsurance program that had been placed on probation because of numerous problems with its loan-approval practices. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> criticized the firm for most of a nine-page letter but in the next-to-last paragraph announced he was lifting restrictions <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> had placed on the company. At the time, DRG was on <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> probation and had to have all its loans approved in advance. Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s client was applying to DRG for financing and its project was stalled because <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION> had to get <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> approval of the loan. Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said she made comments about the draft letter but that it was not changed to reflect her position. And she disputed contentions that she should not have been shown the document before it was made public, saying there frequently was such `` give and take about the language'' between <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials and representatives of major firms doing business with the agency. Subcommittee member, however, did not accept her justification. `` I think you are being evasive,'' <PERSON> Shays </PERSON> said after Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said she could not respond in detail to his question about Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s role in a later decision involving DRG, this one an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to help a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> development on which <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> coinsured a mortgage that was issued at several times the property's value. The exchanges with <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> were at times humorous. When <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> told Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., that he had great respect for the congressman and his `` knack'' for crafting catchy phrases, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> responded: `` Why do I feel I should hold on to my wallet at this moment, Mr <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>?''

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> will meet with new President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to discuss how the new government should be formed, the state-run news agency said Monday. The meeting in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on Tuesday will be the first since the army general and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> first secretary was narrowly elected president by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on July 19. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> began consultations with leaders of the nation's political and social forces Monday, meeting the chairmen of two parties allied with his own <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> is in the process of deciding who to nominate as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s next prime minister and has urged Solidarity to join the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a coalition government. Solidarity lawmakers, who as the result of partly democratic elections in June control the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and account for 35 percent of the parliament's lower house, are deeply divided over whether to enter into such a coalition. On Thursday, Solidarity lawmakers discussed whether to share the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> with party ministers or whether to demand all the Cabinet seats including the prime minister's post but excluding control of the army and police. They also considered whether to stay entirely out of the government and function solely as a parliamentary opposition. The debate was to resume this week. The <ORGANIZATION> Walesa-Jaruzelski </ORGANIZATION> meeting, confirmed by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Pusz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, was expected to give both leaders a chance to exchange views on how the next government should be formed. On Monday, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> met with chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the two allied parties that form the Communist coalition in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. The new president also will meet with chairmen of the official <ORGANIZATION> OPZZ </ORGANIZATION> union, other government-sanctioned groups and the independent farmers union, Rural Solidarity, the agency said.

<HEAD>Bennett Says Tax Hike May Be Needed To Fight Drugs `Down the Road'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's top anti-drug official, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, said Monday that higher taxes may be needed `` down the road'' to fight the war on drugs. `` I'll go on record: crack is worse than taxes,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told reporters after a closed meeting with representatives of the nation's mayors, who want more federal anti-drug aid flowing to cities. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, after hearing the mayors' request, told reporters: `` I do n't think we immediately have to say, ` Well, we're going to have to raise taxes.' Maybe down the road we will. But I think there are other choices. It's facing priorities.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, also said that crack _ a potent, highly addictive form of cocaine _ is `` a hell of a lot worse than pork, too.'' Referring to unspecified `` pork barrel'' projects members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> like to bring to their districts, he said, `` If we're going to spend more money on the war on drugs, we have got to decide where we're going to get the money to do it. Earlier, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> heard the mayors push a 16-point plan they want included in the national drug control strategy he is to produce by Sept. 5. One point calls for increased aid for state and local anti-drug programs `` with a significant portion of the funds going directly to local governments,'' bypassing high-level bureaucracies. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, commented after the meeting that `` most of us have had to raise taxes in our local communities already to deal with the drug problem, so we're not afraid to recommend that.'' <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> made no commitment to back a tax increase. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, `` The people are ready to accept an increase in taxes if they knew that the taxes were going solely to interdict drugs and not for some social program which they may or may not agree with.'' The slogan `` crack is worse than taxes,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, `` means that people will pay to have this monster lifted from their shoulders so their kids can be protected.'' <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> called for $ 3 billion in federal funds to be distributed to states and cities to fight the drug war and said, `` People will support tax dollars targeted to the war on drugs.'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said he asked <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> whether he would support an appropriation of $ 3 billion for the states and cities and was told, `` It depends on what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does.'' Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would support such a plan if <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, supports it, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said: `` I did n't get an answer out of Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. He said maybe we could rearrange money someway from here to there. `` That's not what we're talking about. We do n't want to take money from the homeless or infant mortality or from child care ... or from affordable housing.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> acknowledged that fighting the war on drugs `` is going to cost more money ... and I think we should look to the federal government for some of that money.'' But he did n't say how much. `` Mayors always ask for more,'' he said. `` That's what mayors do. I know that. They know that.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, citing national security concerns, won a delay Monday in the Iran-Contra criminal case against the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s former station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. A 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, issued an emergency stay to temporarily block the trial of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. The ex-CIA operative's trial was to have started Monday, but the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> wanted to stop <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s lawyers from identifying as part of his defense three <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> programs in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and locations of three <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> stations and facilities in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sought the emergency stay after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> rejected prosecutors' proposals to substitute numbers for the three <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> locations and to drop portions of one criminal charge against <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> to avoid mentioning the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> programs. <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> must be allowed to mention the names of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> programs and that substituting numbers for names of the three <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> locations was not acceptable. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, a deputy assistant attorney general, told the judge the department would seek a delay of the trial. With a pool of prospective jurors waiting in a room adjacent to the court, the judge, obviously irritated, asked Noble why the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did n't take action a week ago. `` This is a very difficult thing for the department to do,'' replied <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>. He said the proposals from the prosecutors `` would allow this trial to go forward. We have no alternative.'' At the appeals court, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to formally intervene in the case and wants the court to reconsider <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>'s denial of the prosecutors' proposals. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> is charged with lying about his involvement with <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Contra resupply network. He faces two counts of obstruction and two counts of making false statements in his responses to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office and the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> went to the appeals court instead of taking an unprecedented step of filing a national security affidavit with the court. Such a document would categorically bar disclosure of certain classified information and could kill the case. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, called the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s trip to the appeals court unconscionable. `` We do n't even know what case we're trying,'' complained <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. He said the government has known since charges were first brought against <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> last year that his defense would involve significant disclosures of classified information. Saying that `` enough is enough,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> called on the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to file a national security affidavit. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that was filed in court Monday, Independent Counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> was trying to `` protect a fictional secret `' by objecting to the release of certain classified documents. The <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case, he said, would be untriable if the department blocks disclosure of the names of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> stations as well as of the three CIA Costa Rican programs. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> added that if the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> action to protect documents prevents the trial from going forward, `` I believe that there must be a broad re-evaluation of the standards'' under which such power is exercised. With a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> affidavit in hand, <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> would have no choice under federal law but to prohibit the ex-CIA operative from using in his defense the classified information detailed in the affidavit. That could lead to the judge dismissing some or all the criminal charges, on grounds that the prohibited information was vital to giving him a fair trial.

Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reported earning more than $ 9 million in honoraria last year, usually from special interest groups trying to influence legislation. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules allow a member to keep only $ 2,000 per appearance.

 <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> billed their hotels a half-million dollars for antique jade figures for their <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> mansion in February 1984, an art dealer testified Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> returned one of the art objects a year and a half later and personally cashed a $ 71,000 refund, witness <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahkenazie </PERSON> testified at Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s federal tax-evasion trial. <PERSON> Ashkenazie </PERSON> said he went along with a scheme to bill the hotels for the jade by submitting fake invoices for furniture purchases because the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> were weeks late in payment and he was having cash flow problems. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> admitted into evidence invoices that gave detailed descriptions of antique furniture that did n't change hands. In other testimony, the executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Helmsley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerigo </PERSON>, said the Park Lane Hotel paid a $ 10,685 bill for uniforms for the servants at the <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, mansion, <PERSON> Dunnellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. The uniforms included suits, clip ties, black trousers and swallowtail jackets for the butlers; four kinds of aprons, pink checked and black cotton dresses and matching headpieces for the maids; and cotton jackets and trousers for the cook. <PERSON> Lerigo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ashkenazie </PERSON>, whose business <ORGANIZATION> Ashkenazie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is located in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, testified with immunity in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and two former aides, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, are charged with tax evasion. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s case was severed from his wife's because a series of strokes affected his memory and he was declared icompetent to stand trial. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> is accused of evading taxes by disguising $ 4 million in renovations at Dunnellen Hall and other personal items as business expenses. <PERSON> Ashkenazie </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>, who head a $ 5 billion hotel and real estate empire, agreed to buy a $ 210,000 jade water buffalo, a $ 150,000 jade mountain, a $ 80,000 jade incense burner and a $ 60,000 pair of lavender jade buffalo. Five weeks later, after he pressed for payment, <PERSON> Licari </PERSON> telephoned and told him to send new invoices that indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> had bought furniture, <PERSON> Ashkenazie </PERSON> testified. `` I do n't see how I can do that. We do n't deal in furniture,'' <PERSON> Ashkenazie </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>. <PERSON> Licari </PERSON> then told him to send blank invoices that he would fill out in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ashkenazie </PERSON> could keep his own records, he said. A year and a half later, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> called him and said she was unhappy with the jade mountain and asked for a refund. The <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> decided to take two additional jade objects in exchange, leaving a $ 71,000 balance, <PERSON> Ashkenazie </PERSON> testified. He said he sent the amount in two checks made out to Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, who endorsed and cashed each check.

<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> spoke Monday against lightly and frivolously amending the Constitution to ban flag burning. `` I can not imagine why anyone in this country, the president or anybody else, should favor amending the Constitution unnecessarily without reason if a statute can accomplish all the objectives that the president or others seek,'' the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Democrat said in his first appearance as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders contend it is possible to draft a statute banning flag burning that will meet the standards of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled last month in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> case that flag burning was a protected form of free expression. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders are backing a constitutional amendment, arguing that a statute ca n't work The issue has raised political tensions in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers opposed to the amendment worried that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign organization will flog them as less patriotic unless they vote for it. `` I think to lightly, frivolously almost, rush forward and amend the Constitution out of political or partisan or legalistic reasons when there is an opportunity to consider a statute ... achieving the objectives is something that we should all be concerned about,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be wise to draft a statute and see what the courts do with it,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can include with the statute a provision that would speed court review, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is expected to meet on flag legislation later this week and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he still intends to bring a statute to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> before the August recess. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he might not be able to block a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote on the constitutional amemdment, but indicated he'd at least like to let the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> act first, which it is now scheduled to do in October. `` The danger is not only amending the Constitution without necessity, it's lowering the level of resistance in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the country to amendments to the Constitution and most particularly to the First Amendment, which is the basis as we all know of speech, religious and press liberty,'' he said.

<HEAD>Panel Says Lyme Disease Is Spreading Quickly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lyme disease, a tick-borne illness that is difficult to diagnose, has been reported in 43 states and will soon reach five more, a panel predicted Monday. `` Lyme disease is one of the most rapidly growing diseases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' that are spread by carriers other than humans, said Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausman </PERSON>, who is with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arthritis </ORGANIZATION> and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. <PERSON> Hausman </PERSON> spoke at a news conference, along with two members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> family struck by the illness, to mark Lyme Disease Awareness Week, which began Monday. Lyme disease, which is caused by a bacterium, is spread by the common deer tick. Symptoms usually start with a circular rash, and include fever, chills, fatigue, aching and stiffness. Paralysis may follow. While most of the known cases have been concentrated in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> _ particularly <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> counties in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ Lyme disease was reported last year in every continental state except <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` We wo n't stop the ticks _ they're in 43 states already and soon they'll be in 50,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. There were nearly 14,000 reported cases in 1988, but `` we fear this is a very low number,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. In 1987, there were only 5,800 reported cases, but much of the jump was due to better reporting, said Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyes </PERSON>, director of the office of disease prevention at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Bush Urges Lawmakers to Back His Spending Plans for B-2 and Star

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS graf 9: ``While House,'' to UPDATE with Senate approval
of tactical missile amendment; edits to tighten.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Monday to accept his call for billions of dollars for the B-2 bomber and Star Wars as lawmakers squared off in initial skirmishing on a defense blueprint for the year. Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> predicted the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would pare <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for $ 4.7 billion for the so-called stealth bomber for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. He said the plane `` will survive in some form of limited procurement.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summoned lawmakers to the White House and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> offered his prediction as both houses began work on differing versions of defense legislation. Debate was expected to consume several days in both houses. Facing growing opposition to the stealth bomber, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally lobbied members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and other leading senators, urging support for the `` revolutionary plane with revolutionary technology.'' `` We need the utmost flexibility in terms of arms control,'' the president said, dismissing complaints about the bomber's high price tag _ $ 70 billion for 132 planes, or $ 530 million a copy. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> conceded that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> should have released the cost estimates on the bomber earlier than it did. The bomber program, shrouded in secrecy for 10 years, has become more public with the release of figures last month and the aircraft's first flight last week. `` Those numbers should have been revealed publicly a lot sooner than they were,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters during a meeting in his congressional office. `` It would have made -LRB- the political battle -RRB- a lot less complicated and much easier.'' The vice president, who plans to spend Tuesday lobbying for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s version of the defense budget, indicated that the administration faces a tougher fight in the House than in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. While House members clashed in general debate over the B-2 and <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved by a vote of 91-to-0 an amendment to add $ 596.8 million in fiscal 1990 and $ 336.8 million in fiscal 1991 for tactical missiles, which includes the Stinger and TOW. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could expect a difficult conference fight with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over the defense budget At the start of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate, Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, proclaimed that the `` unchecked defense budget is history. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, a member of the armed services panel, said that although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget is `` not ideal, it represents the best compromise given the budget problems in our nation.'' House debate got off to a rocky start as Republicans criticized a decision by the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to vote on the fate of the V-22 Osprey and the F-14D Tomcat in a single amendment. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, in crafting a $ 295 billion defense budget, has proposed eliminating the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> V-22, a tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but can fly like a plane, and the F-14D jet fighter. After a few hours of behind-the-scenes wrangling, Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, offered a provision to allow the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to vote on separate amendments to eliminate money for the V-22 and F-14D The procedural rule then was approved by voice vote. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, plans to introduce an amendment to accept <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s budget. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> also had sought separate amendments on whether to fund the V-22 and F-14D. But the Rules Committee had decided to combine the two in a single amendment and the panel's minority members approved the decision. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan was to complete the defense bill by the end of the week. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> planned to take up Star Wars on Tuesday, the stealth bomber and ICBMs on Wednesday and other aspects of the defense bill on Thursday. The stealth bomber remained the most controversial and uncertain issue in the bill. Reps. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., will introduce an amendment to freeze funds for the bomber until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> receives more The bill also would include money for production of only two bombers in 1990 and 1991, when the administration wants eight bombers. Another amendment by Reps. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., proposes stopping production after the 13 planes now in construction and mothballing the Rep. <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, D-Mo., will propose accepting the decision of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which cut $ 800 million from the $ 4.7 billion the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> requested for the B-2 in the fiscal 1990 budget House Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> told reporters Monday that he did n't `` sense a Republican or Democratic position on the B-2.'' On Star Wars, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> slashed $ 1.1 billion from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's request of $ 4.9 billion for what is formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. A series of House amendments would eliminate all funds for the program, cut it to $ 1.3 billion, reduce it to $ 3.1 billion or increase it to $ 4.1 billion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told lawmakers Monday: `` I strongly support what we sent up there to the <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. SDI, in my view, is critical.''

<HEAD>Senate Panel Votes Grants Ban on Two Arts Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The National Endowment for the Arts would be forbidden to award tax-paid grants to sponsors of two controversial photographic exhibitions for the next five years under legislation approved Monday by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee. The panel also endorsed a House-approved proposal to trim the endowment's proposed $ 171.4 million budget next year by $ 45,000 _ the exact amount the agency gave for the two controversial shows by photographers <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted $ 100,000 to hire an outside consultant to review the arts endowment's grant-making procedures, which have come under fire recently from several conservative members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel's action drew a fast protest from <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Southern </PERSON>, acting chairman of the endowment, an independent federal agency that currently awards $ 169 million annually to a wide variety of artists and arts institutions, from theaters and symphony orchestras to painters and poets. `` Enactment of this provision would be the first instance since the endowment's founding nearly 25 years ago of direct congressional involvement in awarding or prohibiting specific grants,'' Southern said. `` Banning funding for specific institutions establishes a dangerous precedent which goes against the long and widely respected system of federal support for the arts through a competitive peer review process,'' he said. The bill would impose a five-year ban on <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> grants to the Institute of Contemporary Art at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the Mapplethorpe exhibition, and the <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, which awarded NEA funds to <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> had given $ 30,000 to underwrite a national tour of the Mapplethorpe show, which included homoerotic and sadomasochistic pictures and several photos of nude children. The Corcoran Gallery of Art in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> canceled plans to display the Mapplethorpe photos to avoid becoming involved in a political battle over congressional financing of the endowment. <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> received a $ 15,000 NEA grant through the Southeastern Center for his work, which included a widely criticized photograph of a Christ figure submerged in a container of the artist's urine. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in its action on the arts endowment's budget on July 12, did not propose banning grants to the two photographers' sponsors, but did include language intended to make the endowment more accountable for grant funds that are dispensed by a local institution The Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>, a Methodist minister from <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to eliminate all funds for the arts endowment to halt what he called government subsidies for `` pornography and anti-Christian bigotry.'' <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>, executive director of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, held a news conference Monday outside the endowment's headquarters here to protest the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s indirect support for <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> called their photographs `` extremely offensive, demeaning and pornographic.''

<TEXT>
 Leaders of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels said Monday they were meeting with Central American presidents to explain their reluctance to disband before before <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> achieves democracy. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> issued a statement Monday rejecting allegations that its diplomats helped leftist Salvadoran guerrillas and were guilty of subversion. The seven members of the political and military commission of the Nicaraguan Resistance, as the Contras call their organization, told a news conference they met earlier Monday with President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. They conferred Saturday with President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and planned meetings Tuesday with presidents <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the four other Central American leaders are to meet Aug. 5-7 in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, about implementing a Central American peace plan that includes disbanding the U.S.-supported rebels. Contra leaders said they want demobilization delayed until <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government guarantees national elections scheduled for Feb. 25 will be honest and fair. `` Our army must remain intact to act as guarantors of any accord'' to make <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> democratic, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Galeano </LOCATION>, one of the Contra leaders. <PERSON> Galeano </PERSON> said his commission believed <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> would present the Contra point of view, `` at least partially,'' at the Honduran summit. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ended military aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels in February 1988, but the Contras continue to receive nonlethal assistance. The Nicaraguan Embassy statement responded to accusations Friday by a woman student, arrested on charges of taking part in rebel activities, who claimed an embassy officer provided Salvadoran guerrillas with money and training. It described the allegations as part of a campaign to undermine the Central American summit. <PERSON> Zoila </PERSON> <PERSON> Marroquin </PERSON>, a student at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who said she had been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla organization since 1986, spoke to reporters at <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Police headquarters. She is being held for sedition. Ms. <PERSON> Marroquin </PERSON> said Nicaraguan consul <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> channeled money from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and its Soviet bloc allies to guerrilla fronts at the university and gave students grants for political and military training in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The embassy denied any staff members had met with Ms. <PERSON> Marroquin </PERSON>, and declared: `` Her statements lack any element of truth because they refer to events that did not occur.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has said he will present evidence at the summit that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has supplied weapons to the Salvadoran rebels. Human rights groups estimate more than 70,000 people have been killed since guerrillas began fighting in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in October 1979.

 Thousands of residents fled from artillery duels in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Monday, some taking their dead with them amid reports that 14 years of civil war have filled <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s cemeteries to capacity The ghost-town atmosphere also spawned the first major bank robbery in two years. `` I have never seen <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in such sadness,'' said one resident. `` It is as if the whole of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is preparing for a funeral.'' Syrian gunners killed an elderly Greek Orthodox priest and wounded three other civilians in a bombardment of Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the shore north of the capital, said a police spokesman. Christian artillery blasted Syrian batteries along west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seafront, but all shells landed offshore and there were no casualties, said the spokesman He also said six people drowned this weekend trying to get water from wells in Moslem districts of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, which has been without water for a week. The latest casualties raised the toll to 453 dead and 1,859 injured since the confrontation erupted March 8 between Lebanese army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mostly Christian troops and Moslem Syrian army soldiers. The shelling went on sporadically through the night but was less intense than the weekend bombardment, which underscored <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s attempt to break <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s naval and land blockades imposed March 14 against the 310-square-mile Christian enclave <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has blockaded illegal ports operated by Moslem militias. Police said 700,000 of the city's 1.5 million residents have fled since March, with a quarter-million streaming out in recent days. In west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elias </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, masked gunmen stormed into the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, locked employees and clients in one room and escaped with an estimated $ 40,000, said the police spokesman. Bank robberies proliferated during the lawless period between 1984 and 1987 when feuding Moslem militias fought for control of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Robberies declined after <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> sent troops to restore order. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> keeps 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Lately, caskets have been piling up around the city's cemeteries, and ambulances and hearses were seen leaving <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Monday taking the dead to other parts of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for burial `` Cemeteries in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the city of death, have no room left for new graves,'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper said Monday. It quoted an unidentified cemetery caretaker as saying: `` Graves are full. The new fatalities will have to remain out in the open because there is no burial space left.'' More than 150,000 people have been killed since the civil war broke out in 1975, mostly in and around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` We're packed to the brim,'' said a Greek Orthodox priest at west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Saint <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s church, whose courtyard houses the biggest Christian cemetery in the Moslem sector. `` We have to work out a system to cope, but I do n't know how.'' <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s vast public beaches were deserted Monday and the only people on the streets searched for water. `` Water vendors are making a killing,'' according to <PERSON> Zuheir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullah </PERSON>, a janitor who said he had just invested his savings of $ 750 buying 200 gallons of water, half of which he plans to sell. Vendors are selling water for about $ 10 a gallon. In <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s rival Shiite Moslem factions pledged in a joint communique issued in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to end their 15-month-old feud, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. An estimated 560 people have been killed in fighting between the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia and pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> that erupted in early July following a five-month lull. The communique was published Monday, one day after leaders of both Shiite factions ended a two-week visit to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> report monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> have been fighting to dominate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites.

 Arctic Eskimos from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in the west to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> in the east met in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> on Monday to discuss common cultural and ecological problems. It was the first time a Soviet delegation attended a general assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> Inuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circumpolar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, a non-governmental umbrella organization for Inuit, or Eskimos, from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. About 450 Inuit were expected take part in the <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> township of <LOCATION> Sisimuit </LOCATION>. A 10-man delegation, which is attending as an observer, says it represents native Siberians known as Yuit. `` Even though President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika has reached areas of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> where the 1,600 Yuit live, there are many problems we would like to discuss with the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION>,'' delegation leader <PERSON> Nadesjda </PERSON> <PERSON> Utke </PERSON> said during a stopover in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>. `` We want to exchange experiences in maintaining traditional hunting and implements, educational materials and greater participation by the local people in decision-making,'' she said. The fifth general assembly was being held under the motto `` A Celebration of Inuit Unity,'' to mark the first Soviet participation. It was opened by the current Conference President, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Topics for discussion during the five-day gathering included environment and renewable resources, promotion of Inuit rights internationally and transboundry pollution of the Arctic. A series of workshops were set up to study and report back on such specialized topics as <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> peace and security, whaling, the `` anti-harvesting'' conservation movement's impact on traditional hunting, Inuit culture, land use and costal zone management. About 40,000 Inuit live in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, 28,000 in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and 11,000 in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The Soviet Inuits comprise a small part of the 150,000 natives of the Siberian north. <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, the world's biggest island and a former colony of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, this summer celebrates its tenth year with homerule-style local government.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Opens National Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s ruling party, opened its national congress Monday with strong hints of moving away from Marxist ideology toward a market-oriented economy. The eight-day party congress also is expected to debate a plan by President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> calling for negotiation between the government and rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, commonly called <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION>, the Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION>, has ruled the nation in southeastern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. The rebel war, combined with mismanagement and a weak infrastructure left by the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION>, has made <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> one of the world's poorest countries. In his opening address, <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> appeared to hint at better relations with businessmen and others who have had little influence in the past. `` Since our essential task is to combat the destabilization of which the country is a target, all Mozambican classes and social strata are equally involved in the project'' of rebuilding the country, he declared. Among changes to be considered are admission of property owners, businessmen, shop owners and the religious faithful to Frelimo membership. <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> said, however, that religious believers would have to `` accept that the implementation of the party program is no less important'' than their beliefs. The country has a mixture of Christians, Moslems and animists. Another proposed change would lift restrictions on the number of workers who can be employed by farmers belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION>, which the official news agency AIM said `` is justified by the need to increase food production and for party members to lead this drive.'' It added, however, that a party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> report to be discussed at the congress `` makes clear its preference for party members to work in cooperatives.'' Vigorous debate is expected on economic policy and government efforts to end the war, which has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and half the country's 14.7 million people wholly or partly dependent on food aid. The government has been moving to end central control of the economy since 1983. It has met conditions set by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and has experienced modest growth in recent years after a decade of decline.

<HEAD>Ship Bottom Buckling Concerns Raised Over Impact On Salvageability</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Exxon Pullout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Underwater sections of the hull of the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, ripped open on a reef that caused the nation's worst oil spill, have increasingly buckled and loosened, officials said Monday. `` I want to stress and emphasize we are not yet in a critical situation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON> said. `` We're still optimistic the ship will be able to come in -LRB- for repairs -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON> said the ship remains seaworthy, but its fate increasingly is at the mercy of weather and ocean conditions as it waits off <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to be declared free of environmental and navigational hazards. The Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude into <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s wildlife-rich Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> on March 24 after it went off course and rammed its hull across <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. Preliminary repairs were made before the ship was towed 2,500 miles to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> for repairs in drydock, but during the voyage huge sections of underwater hull plating pulled away and dangled beneath the hull. Working four to six miles off <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, divers through Monday had cut away five of seven jagged steel plates. They began the interim repairs Friday and expect to take three to four more days to finish. The dangling plates must be removed so the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> can navigate <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> shallows en route to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> yard for a nine-month, $ 25 million repair job. Signs of further hull buckling have been spotted, however. `` As these plates loosen, and there are signs more are loosening, it eventually could reach a point where the salvageability of the vessel could be in doubt,'' <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON> said. `` The reason being, it might not have enough bottom for adequate support while the ship is in dry dock.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cool </PERSON> said the company was confident the ship will make it to the NASSCO shipyard. `` We feel pretty confident that we're going to arrest any further deterioration of the hull by cutting the plates which are hanging down ... and cutting small pieces of plate before they pull away any further,'' Cool said. Cool acknowledged a worsening of ocean conditions could exacerbate the buckling of the ship's hull. `` Obviously, at some point, I do n't know where that point is, the ship would have difficulty in dry docking because you need a bottom to support her,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallet </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASSCO </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of finance and public relations. Cool said no one has calculated just how much of the damaged hull needs to be removed.

<TEXT>
 State environmental officials said Monday they are unhappy with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to withdraw its oil spill cleanup forces from Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> by mid-September, but the company says the pullout is not negotiable. `` We've been saying all along we would operate until about Sept. 15 when we have to shut down because of the weather,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON>. `` None of that has changed. `` Generally Sept. 15 is an average date. Sometimes bad weather starts before that; sometimes after that.'' A July 19 memo from <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s general manager in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, to company officials indicates <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is adamant about a mid-September pullout. He said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> will conduct no winter cleanup operations because of safety and operational reasons and the company's only commitment for next spring is to survey the shorelines. `` These are not negotiable points,'' he wrote in the memo, a copy of which was provided to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The memo was dated the day before Exxon President <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, Science and <ORGANIZATION> Transportion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> He reluctantly committed the company to resuming operations next year if more work needs to be done. But <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Provant </PERSON>, on-scene oil spill coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, said his agency wants <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to leave a contingency force behind to deal with oil that may wash off beaches and cause problems during the winter. `` We're not asking them to do any beach cleaning or anything like that in the winter,'' he said. An army of 11,000 people, 1,000 vessels and more than 70 aircraft has been trying to clean beaches stained by the nation's largest oil spill The Exxon Valdez rammed <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> on March 24, spilling about 11 million gallons of crude oil into the sound's pristine waters `` You ca n't work up to the last day and pull them all out,'' <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON> said. `` We're working on a plan that gets them out by Sept. 15. That's the average date of when the winter storms set in and you can no longer operate out there.'' He said studies to determine the exact day the last <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> workers would be withdrawn should be completed in about two weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> on Monday announced that the cleanup costs stemming from the spill had reduced its second-quarter profit by $ 850 million. <PERSON> Provant </PERSON> said his agency believes the Sept. 15 date is `` arbitrary,'' and that it might be possible to have some crews continue working in the sound until Oct. 1. `` We would like to see that they still maintain come capability to continue working as long as the weather is nice. Plans to have everything out of here by Sept. 15 just seems too rigid to us,'' Provant said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION> plans winter activities such as overflights, mapping, beach monitoring and collection of water quality data. But <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON> said that was out of the question. `` We have no intention of doing that. We think it's a safety factor. We've never talked about operating in the winter on the cleanup,'' he said. The memo also said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s `` discussions with federal or state agencies is for the purpose of keeping them informed, and is not requesting approval. In discussions on these matters you should stress the safety and operational factors. We are willing to discuss these factors. We are not willing to discuss the decisions.'' <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON> said a shoreline assessment would be undertaken in the spring. `` We're saying we do not think that any cleanup operations will be needed because we plan to work on all the shorelines before we pull out,'' he said. `` There will be some oil that remains on some shorelines or down in the gravel. `` But we believe six months of winter storms and tidal action will remove most, if not all, of what's remaining,'' <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON> said. `` If there is remaining oil next spring it will be asphaltic in nature and it would be more environmentally damaging to remove it than to leave it there. It poses no environmental threat.''

<HEAD>Expert: Literature Tests So Poorly Written They Encourage Shortcuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Standardized literature tests are so poorly written they encourage students to read condensed versions of classics, a study released Monday concluded. Multiple-choice exams are more apt to test students on memorized facts than on ideas, said the study by researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. `` The reading of a poem is treated like reading an encyclopedia. What are the facts? It's the Joe Friday approach to education,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Purves </PERSON>, co-director of the university's Center for the Learning and Teaching of Literature. <PERSON> Purves </PERSON> recommended that standardized tests, like the Scholastic Aptitude Test for college-bound students, also use essay questions to make students think about what they've read. He said students can easily get by reading commercial plot summaries. Multiple choice tests satisfy school districts' needs for accountability without truly measuring competence, <PERSON> Purves </PERSON> said. `` They are n't particularly interested in how good the measurements of accountability are, just so they can have a number they can throw in front of their school board,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which produces the Scholastic Aptitude Test, has written multiple-choice test questions that measure analysis and interpretive abilities, spokeswoman <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Waanders </PERSON> said. `` It is true that there can be good multiple-choice questions about interpretation,'' <PERSON> Purves </PERSON> said. `` What we found was that there were very few of them on these tests.''

<HEAD>Panic at Banks as Currency Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police were stationed to guard post offices and banks Monday as Zambians clamored to exchange the old paper money for new currency, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials reported. The old currency must be traded for the new by Aug. 3. It will be without value after that deadline. Monday was the first day of business since the government announced Saturday the currency would be replaced in a move to curb forgery, smuggling and black marketeering. The oficials reported `` scenes of panic'' at banks and business centers in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the country, but there were no reports of violence. A police spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said money traders from neighboring <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> attempted to pass through at least three border posts in northwestern <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> early Monday. He said they were repelled by armed frontier guards but gave no further details. In <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION> about 75 percent of the capital's shops and exchange centers remained closed despite government appeals that they accept the old bank notes until the Aug. 3 deadline. It is believed that Zaireans possess millions of kwacha, the Zambian currency, with much of the money gained from illicit trading along the border. In the northwestern town of <LOCATION> Solwezi </LOCATION>, provincial official <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamalondo </PERSON> urged Zambians not to help Zaireans cross the border to change currency. <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, in the announcement Saturday on the currency change, also ordered the closing of all land-border crossings until Aug. 3. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announcement said the government was replacing the 1.6 billion Kwacha -LRB- $ 100 million -RRB- in circulation. The currency change is one of the economic reforms ordered by President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>. Under the measure Zambians will be able to exchange up to 2,000 Kwacha -LRB- $ 125 -RRB- without providing proof of the source of the money. Amounts over 10,000 Kwacha -LRB- $ 625 -RRB- will be subject to a 50 percent tax. The government has said it believes millions of the old currency bills have been accumulated by individuals through tax evasion, illegal money deals and smuggling, especially between <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Senior Scientists Hard to Recruit, Says NIH Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Low salaries and tempting offers from the private sector are making it increasingly difficult for the government to recruit and retain senior scientists, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the intellectual stimulation, prestige and research freedom offered by the government institutes is not enough to attract and keep top scientists. A change, the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> director said, `` is essential to restoring <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> to a fully competitive posture and demonstrating the commitment of the federal government to maintaining a first-class biomedical research program.'' Of the 176 <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> staff who are members of the Senior Executive Service, 53 are physicians and 104 have doctorate degrees, he said. Senior Executive Service physicians are paid about half as much as their counterparts at university research centers, and those with doctoral degrees are paid 19 percent less than those in comparable academic positions, he said. Additionally, the gap between <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> physician salaries and the pay they would receive at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical school has widened to about $ 99,000, he said. `` Many of our senior scientists are considering whether to remain with <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> because of these salary considerations,'' said <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON>, who was appointed by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1982 and is leaving <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the month. A replacement has n't been nominated by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON> said he is encouraged by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recent proposal to raise salaries for employees in senior positions requiring specialized and critical skills. Under his plan, pay for senior government workers generally would go up by as much as 25 percent. At <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>, top pay for a senior doctoral scientist is $ 76,400 before bonuses. The ceiling for a senior physician is $ 96,400. Bonuses can boost that to a maximum of $ 99,000, said <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Storm </PERSON> <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON>. According to a recent <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> survey to which a quarter of its Ph.D. scientists and science managers responded, 83 percent reported receiving one or more employment offers ranging from $ 100,000 to $ 500,000, <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON> said. The average offer was $ 166,000, he said. `` With offers of this magnitude, <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> can expect to lose a substantial number of key senior research scientists and science managers,'' he said. Low pay has also hampered recruiting efforts, he said. `` Since 1980, <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> has not been able to recruit a single research scientist into the Senior Executive Service from the private or academic sectors to engage in the independent conduct of a clinical or basic biomedical research program,'' the director said.

<HEAD>Poll: Most Teens Take Up the Habit Because of Friends, Social Pressure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most teen-agers who smoke do so because their friends light up or because they feel peer pressure, a survey conducted by teen-agers indicates. The poll, commissioned by a trade association of vending-machine operators, also indicates that teen-agers mostly buy cigarettes over the counter, not from machines. The poll results were released Monday, a day before the chief counsel for the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> was to testify before a congressional hearing on regulating tobacco sales through vending machines. `` We in the vending industry have long been aware that our machines are not a significant source of cigarettes for minors because the majority is located in bars, cocktail lounges and places of employment were teen-agers are not present,'' said the attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Funk </PERSON>. The survey involved interviews of 1,015 people ages 13 to 17. The interviews were conducted at 40 shopping malls in 20 major cities. The study found that 42 percent of the teen-agers questioned started smoking because their friends used tobacco. Thirty percent said peer pressure was the cause. Association spokesman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said he could not distinguish between those responses, but said they are based on the respondents' words. An additional 15 percent of those surveyed cited smoking by parents or other relatives as the reason they started using tobacco. On the vending-machine issue, 78 percent of the teen-agers who `` often or occasionally'' buy cigarettes said they `` seldom or never'' used vending machines. Among teen-agers who buy over the counter, 43 percent said they get cigarettes at convenience stores, 29 percent from gas stations, 11 percent from grocery stores and 6 percent from drug stores. The rest said they got them other places. The poll was conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Response </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, which reported a margin of error of 3.2 percent. The company said it used teen-age interviewers in the belief that answers would be more frank than if adults did the polling.

 A $ 60 million federal attempt to detail environmental problems at nuclear weapons plants may not be reliable because <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> staff members did n't keep good notes, the department's inspector general reported Monday. The department said it disagreed with the IG's assessment. Aides who conducted the three-year survey of environmental problems at the plants produced poorly organized supporting documents, said the report by Inspector General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Layton </PERSON>. The supporting documents were mainly log books with notes taken in the field. `` They generally were not recorded in complete sentences and were not detailed enough to function as a memory aid even to team members, who may be involved in hundreds of findings at dozens of locations,'' the report said. `` The notes were neither indexed nor organized in a way that would allow anyone to trace facts or conclusions in the reports back to the source. Team members acknowledged that it would be difficult and time consuming to locate information in the backup documents.'' The $ 60 million inventory was ordered under Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. It was not immediately clear whether it will be used to set cleanup priorities for the highly contaminated nuclear weapons plants. <PERSON> Layton </PERSON> said the shortcomings in the way the plants were evaluated `` undermine the credibility of the process and call into question the usefulness of the surveys.'' Decision-makers `` can not be assured that the $ 60 million effort provides a sound basis for prioritizing environmental problems,'' <PERSON> Layton </PERSON> said in a memo to Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. The Energy Department's response, included in the report, said the poorly organized records criticized by the inspector general were n't intended to be reference materials. The preliminary reports produced by the field staff were sent to the various plants, where they `` were not found to be deficient,'' the department said. <PERSON> Layton </PERSON> said there's a chance some contamination may not be adequately indentified, and there's a chance critical projects may lose limited cleanup money because they were n't put in the right place on the priority list. But the department said the inspector general `` extrapolated beyond what is reasonable.'' <PERSON> Layton </PERSON> briefly mentioned his findings during a congressional hearing last week, but details were not available until the report came off the press.

<HEAD>Court Rules Government Must Recognize Jewish Conversions Abroad</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided Monday that the government must recognize conversions to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> by Reform and Conservative rabbis abroad, starting a new round in a controversy that has angered many American Jews. In another decision, a five-judge panel of the court upheld an Orthodox monopoly by rejecting an appeal that Reform rabbis be allowed to perform marriages in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The 4-1 ruling on the `` Who is a Jew'' question prompted leaders of the ultra-Orthodox Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> party to meet Monday night and discuss whether to to withdraw support from Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s coalition government. `` We have a secular court interfering in a religious subject,'' said Agudat legislator <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Porush </PERSON>. The party has five seats of the 120 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Orthodox rabbis echoed Religious Affairs Minister <PERSON> Zevulun </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>'s pledge to renew the campaign for a narrower definition of who is a Jew, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` The problem remains as an open wound and will not be solved until it is solved at its roots: that a Jew is a Jew only according to Halacha,'' Chief Rabbi <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapira </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Halacha is orthodox Jewish law. Interior Minister <PERSON> Arye </PERSON> <PERSON> Deri </PERSON> of Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party, said he would stop signing identity cards issued by his ministry. `` My signature means that information in the identity card is true,'' he said. `` If the court says I can not decide about that, I shall not sign.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said identity cards would carry a sticker saying data contained in the `` nationality'' and `` religion'' sections could not be verified. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Rabbi <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoffie </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zionists </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> said: `` We're very pleased. What it means is that the law that currently exists ... will now be enforced.'' <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, associate executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` At a time when there appears to be dissension and division, this is a welcome affirmation that the common bonds of Jewish history and fate have endured and continue to bind us into one people.'' The court ruling revives an argument over Orthodox efforts to amend <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Law of Return to limit those automatically entitled to Israeli citizenship. Orthodox Jews want to include only Jews born to Jewish mothers or converted according to Halacha, which in effect would mean by Orthodox rabbis. Current Israeli law also grants automatic citizenship to anyone who has converted to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> and is not a member of another faith. The change has been fought by Conservative and Reform rabbis, whose followers constitute a majority of more than 5 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews but who have few adherents in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. They say the Orthodox proposal would symbolically excommunicate them from Judaism and alienate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Rabbis in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> make about 11,000 conversions a year, while Orthodox rabbis perform about 1,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> favored appeals from eight <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> immigrants and one from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> who were denied Israeli citizenship by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The court's ruling said an Israeli Population Register Law of 1965 did not entitle the government to decide the validity of conversions outside the country. `` On this matter, it has no bearing on whether the community -LRB- conducting the conversion -RRB- is Orthodox, Conservative or Reform,'' the court said. The marriage ruling came on appeals made seven years ago by Rabbi <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rabbi, <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotem </PERSON>. The judges upheld three laws that give <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Orthodox rabbis exclusive rights to decide eligibility for presiding at marriages.

 A paraplegic man using his arms to hoist himself up set out on a 600-foot pitch Monday in hopes of making up more than a day in lost time in his quest to scale the majestic El Capitan rock. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON>, 29, and lead climber <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON>, fresh from making it over the feared Shield Roof, successfully tackled the steep Groove pitch. By the end of the day, they hoped to have climbed nearly twice their average distance since setting out a week ago. A pitch is a climbing distance measured by a single 160-foot rope length. The pair were at 2,000 feet Monday morning on the 3,593-foot monolith. `` They want to get off the wall as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Dapprich </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Yosemite. `` Their spirits are high; but they are tired and their hands are swollen.'' If he is successful, <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON> would become the first paraplegic to climb one of the world's most challenging cliffs. <PERSON> Malori </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who is coordinating news coverage, said the two should complete the climb late Tuesday or early Wednesday. <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON> has estimated it will take him 7,000 pullups to reach the top. <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON> was left paralyzed from the waist down when he fell 50 feet during a climb in 1982.

 Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> on Monday temporarily suspended regulations requiring shrimpers to use new devices intended to protect endangered sea turtles from getting entangled and dying in their nets. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s decision came on the heels of weekend protests by angry shrimpers who blocked ship channels along the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and threatened violence if the regulations were not changed or reversed on use of so-called turtle excluders. `` We have worked out what I think is a good compromise that indicates sympathy to the shrimpers and their families as well as caring about the endangered species in general and the <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> turtles in particular,'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said after meeting with gulf state lawmakers <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said enforcement of the turtle excluder regulations would be suspended for 45 days. At the end of the period, shrimpers would be required to pull their nets every 90 minutes but would not have to use the turtle excluders. According to lawmakers, turtles can live for 90 minutes underwater if trapped in a net. After the 45-day period is up, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> enforcement staff would issue warnings to shrimpers caught not pulling their nets after 90 minutes. The agency would re-evaluate the regulations next year. A study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> is expected to be completed in February. In <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, hundreds of shrimpers awaiting word of <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s action at the <ORGANIZATION> Galveston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> station broke into cheers when they heard the news. `` This is a lot more than we though we'd get,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Santini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, who estimated he lost $ 6,000 to $ 7,000 during the ship channel blockade. `` We can make a living now.'' In <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, boat owner <PERSON> Ashful </PERSON> <PERSON> Authement </PERSON> said: `` If they go for 90 minutes, I can relate to that. But there are some times -LRB- when -RRB- it might take you that long to find a good fishing spot and then you have to stop and pick up.'' `` At the end of 45 days, it seems like we're facing the same thing again,'' said <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> deck hand <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` We got a good deal,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. `` I think it is a reasonable compromise. It represents a sound way to approach the problem.'' But one environmental group planned to organize a national boycott of shrimp as a result of <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s action. `` The radical action of the secretary of commerce has convinced us that we need to take some radical action,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, vice president of programs for the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>'s organization also planned to seek a temporary restraining order against <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>. The shrimpers had contended their business would be ruined by the turtle excluder regulations. In <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on Monday, shrimpers met with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> about the rule, which was issued under the federal Endangered Species Act. About 200 shrimp boats on Saturday crowded the deep-water <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> ship channel and about 300 shrimpers jammed <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aransas </LOCATION>, gateway to the Port of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Those blockades, as well as similar actions at smaller <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> ports, ended Sunday pending the outcome of the meetings Monday. Ship traffic was reported normal Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The turtle devices are intended to save many of the 11,000 turtles that conservationists estimate are killed each year in shrimp nets. The devices, which cost from $ 60 to several hundred dollars each, are made of wire mesh and have hinged doors to allow turtles to swim out before the net is pulled aboard a boat. Shrimpers say the devices allow valuable shrimp to escape as well. The shrimpers also complain that the hinged devices are bulky, dangerous and expensive to operate. The rule requiring the devices was to take effect May 1, but its enforcement has been sporadic. Failure to use the devices, which federal officials say cost shrimpers 6 to 7 percent of their catch, could result in fines of up to $ 25,000 and six months in jail.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cautioned the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> against trying to smuggle <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> out of the country weeks before reports surfaced that the veteran American diplomat was suspected of being a spy, it was learned Monday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described reports of spying by <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> as `` very serious'' but did not offer an assessment of potential damage. Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> had been videotaped handing a briefcase to a Soviet agent in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> earlier this year. Government sources also disclosed an unusual level of Soviet interest in <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s case. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, stripped of his official passport and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> credentials, spent the day with one of his two daughters in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said he remains on the payroll, though on leave, and he has not been charged with any offense. It was also learned that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, when stationed in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, had lobbied to keep Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> off the list of people banned from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for past Nazi activities. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> is refusing through his attorney to be questioned by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, and only submitted to a short interrogation early in the investigation by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> security officers, according to a government source familiar with the case. The Soviets were informed through diplomatic channels, in a message described as `` discreet,'' that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would be damaged if they tried to make off with the 54-year-old diplomat, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official disclosed. `` So far, they have observed the admonition,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the Soviets were cautioned even as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators were compiling evidence against <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> but before they had all the material eventually amassed. Another government source familiar with the case told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the Soviets have exhibited extraordinary interest in the <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> case. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents tailing <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> on Saturday as he drove to his daughter's home outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were followed in turn by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> personnel, according to this source. It could not be learned how many Soviet agents followed the caravan of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents driving behind <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> and his family as he traveled from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chappaqua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Saturday afternoon. This source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the unusual Soviet surveillance of the caravan shows `` they have a lot invested in this.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported that a Soviet agent gave <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> a warning that he had come under suspicion. The network said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents monitoring <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s telephone calls heard the same agent who received the briefcase in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> advise <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> by telephone: `` A bad virus is going around and we believe you are infected.'' That telephone call came before the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> first tried to interview <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> on June 22, the day he was placed on leave, the network said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did not impose restrictions on his travels, and doubts were raised that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> would ever come to trial. Administration sources said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government investigators had not uncovered any accomplices within the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nor were the Soviets likely to come forward and implicate <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, a 54-year-old native of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` He might just end up being retired and put out to pasture,'' an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> himself has been staying at the home of his daughter, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, local police said. On Monday, he walked through woods behind the house in <LOCATION> Chappaqua </LOCATION>, jumped into a car she was driving and the pair headed south toward <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> followed by a parade of federal autos, police said. She later returned alone. Police Chief <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchila </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Chappaqua </LOCATION>, said, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had notified him of a surveillance operation in the area. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also had been under surveillance for some time before news of the espionage investigation came out Friday night. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> discussed the <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> case extensively with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, said the government source who disclosed <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s lobbying. `` They were very tight'' from the days in the 1950s when Mock and the Austrian-born <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> studied together in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, said the source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. In a move that infuriated many Austrians, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was placed on the list in April 1987, a year after the decision was first made to do so. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who is Jewish, attended the <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> inauguration with approval from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, acknowledged that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> had been back to the department under escort at least once, to collect personal items and to close his credit union account. She said <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who was director of the Office of Regional Political-Economic Affairs in the European bureau, probably had returned on other occasions as well. Visitors are generally admitted to the State Department if officials in the building vouch for them. Before his suspension, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said in response to questions, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> participated in a decision announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last Tuesday to permit the sale of a broad range of personal computers to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and Eastern-bloc countries. But, the spokeswoman added, `` I would not characterize him as a key player.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lined up with the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in recommending the easing of export controls. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> strenuously objected to the decision on security grounds. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his first comments on the spying issue, told reporters at the White House: `` I have known about this matter for some time and the minute I heard about it I was aggrieved because it is a very tragic thing should the allegations be true.'' The president declined to discuss details of the case. But, he said, `` any time a person is ... allegedly involved in something like betraying his country, that to me is a very serious matter.'' Asked about possible damage to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director, replied: `` I do n't think anyone could give you a full damage assessment'' at this time. He added that the allegations, if true, would not help improve relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> even though `` espionage goes on'' all the time. After returning from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in 1987 after an unusually long seven-year stint as deputy ambassador, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was assigned to the senior seminar program at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. But an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, questioned reports that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was disappointed he had not been named an ambassador and that the job amounted to a step down. `` It's not a parking lot kind of job,'' the official said. He said of the <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> case: `` There has to be a presumption of innocence.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Monday the strikes in Soviet coalfields were the biggest test of his four-year economic reforms _ worse than the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> disaster _ and he called for a shake-up of local councils often blamed for blocking progress. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealed last week for a `` renewal'' of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ranks from top to bottom, and his suggestion that local governing bodies also be transformed could mean sweeping leadership changes. Local elections scheduled in the spring throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> involve multiple candidates and for the first time offer serious challenges to entrenched officials. Some members of the national legislature, the Supreme Soviet, said Monday the elections should be held earlier. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said each Soviet republic should decide when and how to hold the elections. He said party and government bodies as well as official trade unions should meet urgently to analyze the two-week strike that at its peak idled half the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 1 million coal industry workers and deprived vital factories of fuel. The Kremlin chief told legislators almost all the miners have returned to work. `` We are coming out of a very serious crisis, the biggest test during the four years of perestroika,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He said the test was even more severe than the April 1986 explosion and fire at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant that killed 31 people, cost millions of dollars to clean up and sparked a nationwide environmental protection movement. The strikes dealt a serious blow to the economy, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, but he reassured his countrymen that `` our perestroika will give results despite the tests we are undergoing.'' He blamed Coal Ministry and local officials rather than the miners, but warned, `` deciding such questions by striking will ruin our work.'' Communist maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> Soviet that local party and government leaders have been inactive and insensitive to people's needs because `` they know they wo n't be re-elected.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that because of the strike, governing councils should not wait for elections to make changes. `` Ripe questions require sessions without delay to discuss reports of regional executive committees, and where it is necessary to take personnel decisions, they must be taken without waiting for elections,'' he said. Several heads already have rolled, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> official news agency reported. It said the party chief and mayor of <PERSON> Stakhanov </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> `` were forced to leave their posts,'' apparently under pressure from strikers. One legislator suggested strike committees be absorbed into local governing councils because they proved they can get things done. In a meeting last Tuesday with party officials, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the party also needs `` a flow of fresh blood, and ... to be renewed at the level of the work place, the locality, the city, the region, the republic, the central committee and the Politburo.'' He said Monday that party bodies should analyze reasons for the strikes, which miners started to press for better supplies of food, consumer goods and housing as well as higher pay and better working conditions. He balked at calls for independent unions, suggesting instead the official unions `` think over what happened and what to do to make sure unions carry out their role.'' Deputies speaking at Monday's nationally broadcast session said the country needs better unions. `` We have to admit the trade unions do n't have the workers' faith,'' said Lithuanian deputy <PERSON> Kazimeras </PERSON> <PERSON> Uoka </PERSON> `` We have to give them the right to establish independent trade unions.'' Soviet unions act as djuncts of the government, handling distribution of benefits rather than fighting for workers' rights. Several deputies from mining regions also called for moving up local elections to this fall to give voters a chance to oust insensitive officials. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said such decisions should be taken in the 15 Soviet republics, not in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, even if it means election laws and schedules will vary. `` Shall we torpedo and limit this?'' he asked. `` We will hardly succeed, commanding from here.'' The Soviet president said at least half the 300,000 striking miners in the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, the country's biggest coal-producing area, have returned to work. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said about 50 of the region's 121 mines remain idle. <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> strikers were among the last holdouts from a nationwide coal strike that started July 11 in western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and spread from the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Last week, the government granted concessions and Siberian miners returned to work. A strike leader in <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> 550 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said by telephone that workers are awaiting `` decisive guarantees'' from the Supreme Soviet that the government will keep promises made to miners Saturday. The Supreme Soviet took no action Monday to guarantee the pact, instead juggling legislation to give priority to strike issues. A deputy from the <LOCATION> Pechora </LOCATION> coal basin in the Arctic told the Supreme Soviet that miners around the city of <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> remain on strike, partly because of media `` disinformation.'' Miner <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lushnikov </PERSON> said state media reported erroneously that the <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> strike had ended. Reports said miners remained on strike at 11 of 13 <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> mines and all 12 mines in <LOCATION> Chervonograd </LOCATION> in the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucherenko </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said the strike settlements probably will cost between $ 4.6 billion and $ 8.6 billion.

<HEAD>Government Approves Private Rocket From California In August</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A test model of a craft that could be used to return astronauts from Space Station Freedom will be tested in a suborbital launch in August by a private <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> firm, an official said Monday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, acting president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Camarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said his firm will launch a single stage rocket to an altitude of 100 miles carrying a model of a space station crew return craft developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. He said the model, about a one-third scale, will test a `` novel experimental concept'' called a parashield. The device, shaped rather like an umbrella, will be used to protect the model during the high-speed portions of its return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, and then will turn and act as an airbrake as the atmospheric thickens. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the primary purpose of the mission was to test the parashield behavior during its fall toward <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The experimental craft weighs about 600 pounds and will be recovered after falling into the sea about 135 miles off shore from the <ORGANIZATION> Vandenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base launch site. Data will be collected by instruments on board and through the use of long-range photography, he said. A secondary payload on the flight will be a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> experiment. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that it was granting a commercial license to American Rocket for the launch. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the launch will use an unusual hybrid rocket engine developed by the company. The rocket is powered by a solid fuel, but uses liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. In this way, he said, the rocket design has the safety advantages of a liquid-fueled rocket, with the dependability of a solid rocket. Hydrid rockets, he said, can be turned on and off like a liquid rocket by controlling the flow of oxygen. But the hybrid is safer than a solid fuel rocket because the propellant is not explosive. The launch will be the first by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the first commercial launch from <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION>, a center used by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to launch polar orbiting craft and to test intercontinental ballistics missiles. Four earlier commercial launch licenses have been granted by the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> and the department is reviewing eight other applications, the announcement said. Space Station Freedom, a permanent laboratory and crew quarters to be assembled in orbit in the mid-1990s, is to include a craft that can be used by astronauts for an emergency return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> model is to test a concept for that craft.

 Lawmakers unveiled draft legislation Monday to impose a ceasefire in the battle over logging in the ancient forests of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, but objections from a <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> senator sidetracked plans for immediate subcommittee action on the bill. Sens. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., and <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., planned to ask the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to approve the legislation Tuesday despite concerns from Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, both at the beginning of the interior appropriations subcommittee meeting and in a letter to full <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-W.V. </LOCATION>, said he was `` deeply disturbed'' that provisions in the bill might preempt the right of environmentalists to appeal timber sales to <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>'s skepticism dampened the excitement of the bill's sponsors who hope to ensure an adequate supply of logs to keep the region's mills operating over the next 14 months, as well as protect some of the old-growth forests that are prime habitat for the northern spotted owl The bill calls for the sale of 10 billion board feet of timber off of the national forests and <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> lands in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over the next 14 months. <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said that is about 10 percent less than the amount of timber that would be sold if some sales were n't blocked by lawsuits to protect the spotted owl. In addition, the plan discourages logging significantly large blocks of old-growth forests, a policy known as `` minimum fragmentation.'' Under the proposal, significant stands of old-growth would have at least eight trees per acre that are at least 300 years old or are 40 inches in diameter. Environmentalists would be allowed to release 1.25 billion board feet of the almost 2 billion board feet of timber sales currently enjoined by federal courts in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` I am concerned that an appeal and judicial exemption process that started with isolated sales could expand to a region, and may soon become national in scope,'' said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, who also is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has jurisdiction over the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, who has close ties to environmental groups, said he was well aware that forest products were `` essential to the economic health'' of the region, but added the right of appeal was `` also of vital importance.'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> agreed to postpone consideration of the bill until the full committee meeting. The sales have been temporarily enjoined by pending lawsuits that claim over-logging in old-growth forests is threatening the northern spotted owl with extinction. The owl hunts and nests almost exclusively in ancient forests. The agreement would prohibit environmentalists from using injunctions to block timber sales in the next fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1.

<DATELINE>WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Forest fires raging through northern <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> have forced the evacuation of more than 18,000 people, and smoke and flames threatened to block some escape routes. The airport in <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was reopened Monday after radar equipment was flown in to help guide airplanes. Pilots were unable to locate the runways because of the dense smoke. Convoys of trucks loaded with food and fuel and escorted by police drove north from <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION> to reach <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> about 470 miles away. Some 4,000 evacuees were being sheltered in <LOCATION> Thompson </LOCATION>, a mining town with a normal population of 15,000. The fires were several miles away from <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and there was no immediate threat to the town. Just east of <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> firefighters sprayed water on a wooden bridge of a railroad used to move evacuees. `` If that bridge goes out then that escape route is cut off to <LOCATION> Churchill </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> Natural Resources Minister <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Enns </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> port city 260 miles northeast of <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. The railroad also links <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> to the south. <PERSON> Enns </PERSON> said all available equipment was being used to evacuate people and to block flames from sweeping through communities. Officials said only a few houses have burned and they had no reports of injuries or deaths. Scores of fires have broken out in parched northern <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> in recent weeks, but winds fanned the blazes last week and they now form a belt more than 200 miles wide beginning about 240 miles north of <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>. Evacuations started Thursday as flames threatened communities. Officials said fires in northern <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> forced 1,200 residents of <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> to flee their homes Saturday. They said that in northwestern <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, 400 people living at <LOCATION> Bearskin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> were flown out Thursday. The fires have swept through at least 2 million acres of brush and timber in a mainly flat area. Military transport planes, trains and private vehicles were being used to remove people from threatened towns in <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> in what is believed to be the largest evacuation in the province's history Officials said 13 towns have been completely evacuated since Thursday and a number of other towns were either partly evacuated or the residents were on standby. About 8,500 people were evacuated when floods ravaged <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> in 1950. <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> officials estimated there are about 250 fires in the fire belt, but they said the figures are uncertain. `` There is too much smoke; we ca n't even see the new fires,'' said <PERSON> Karin </PERSON> <PERSON> Batke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION>'s natural resources department. <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> officials said at least 1,500 firefighters, 53 helicopters, 11 waterbombers, nine fixed-wing aircraft and heavy equipment including bulldozers have been thrown into the battle. A state of emergency was declared Sunday by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Driedger </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION>'s minister of emergency measures. Retired or vacationing civil servants were asked to report for duty as exhausted relief workers toiled around the clock. `` Virtually all of northern <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> is on fire, and we're just hoping some of our major centers are not going to be affected,'' <PERSON> Driedger </PERSON> said. `` Once you get 15 minutes out of <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, all you see is smoke.'' Lightning is blamed for most of the fires, but police believe people started at least two. Weather forecasts said there could be thundershowers in the areas, but the storms could cause more lightning-set fires.

 The Hunt brothers' bank creditors sought control of their business empire after the silver price collapse of March 1980 left the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investors up to $ 2 billion in debt, <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>, testified Monday. `` I was told that the banks wanted to put their arms around all of the Hunts,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korner </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` And by the Hunts I mean Bunker, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> and me. And they wanted to control all of the operations of the Hunts.'' <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> and his other brothers, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, are in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> contesting a total of more than $ 300 million in taxes the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> says is owed from the 1982 dissolution of a partnership set up to repay their debts after silver price collapse. Under the partnership agreement, the family's <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> contributed $ 824 million of a $ 1.1 billion loan it obtained from a consortium of banks. Under a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> directive at the time, banks were not allowed to lend on silver investments. The brothers in turn contributed silver, gold stocks, and coal properties in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> testified the banks insisted he be included in the partnership with his brothers, as well as serve as a guarantor, although he said he had no outstanding bank debts on silver at the time. `` The banks were insisting I be in the partnership,'' <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> said. `` The banks wanted to put their arms now only around <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> and Bunker but they wanted to put their arms around me ... and that was the way it was presented to me. `` I was told the banks were dictating the wording and the terms of the agreement,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. Asked if he had pledged all his assets, including his Rolex watch, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said: `` Yes, the famous watch.'' <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> testified last week that the banks had demanded as collateral `` paintings on the wall'' and his brother's Rolex. Bunker and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> each are contesting more than $ 150 million in 1982 taxes, while <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> is contesting $ 505,377 in taxes. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> said he lost about $ 15 million on his silver investments, which began in 1974. At the height of his silver investing, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said he had 1,600 futures contracts, each for 5,000 ounces of silver. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>, blamed restrictions on silver investors by the commodities markets for the silver price collapse. In a pending case however, the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has accused Bunker and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> of attempting to corner the silver market. It says they owned one-third of the world's silver bullion when prices collapsed A jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last year found Bunker, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> and two others had conspired to manipulate and monopolize the silver market and defraud investors. The two ex-billionaires now owe $ 250 million in fines and interest in that lawsuit, brought by <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON>, the Peruvian silver mining company.

 Authorities on Monday recovered the body of a teen-ager who had clung to a rescue rope in swift waters in a flood-control channel but lost his grip when he was hit by debris. The body of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>, 17, was discovered in the <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arroya </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a member of the aquatic rescue team of the <ORGANIZATION> Bernalillo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The body was recovered 10 to 12 miles away from where <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 14, were skateboarding Sunday in a concrete flood-control channel when they were hit by a 3-foot-high wall of water. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said an inch of rain fell in the area in less than an hour. <PERSON> David </PERSON> was rescued and was treated for cuts and bruises at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. Firefighters had tried to pull out <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON> as he clung to a rope Sunday, but a sudden surge of water carried a floating chair into him, forcing him to let go. At least 10 people, including four police officers and four firefighters, were injured trying to rescue the brothers. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsui </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON>, 17, who were attending a church picnic near the channel, were pulled in as they tried to rescue the <ORGANIZATION> Alvarados </ORGANIZATION>. Firefighters and police rushed to various points along the channel and threw ropes across to try to stop the men. Police officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bode </PERSON> went into the channel and grabbed one person, but lost his grip. Bode clung to a rope across the channel as other officers and bystanders struggled to pull him out, forming a chain along the steep, slippery walls of the channel. Meanwhile, firefighter <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> reached for <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> with a long pole but got pulled in. <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> had on a life vest and tried to keep hold of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION>. `` There were a few times he said, ` That's it.

The two were eventually rescued after traveling 1 -LCB- miles down the channel. <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON> also was rescued, grabbing a rope thrown to him by firefighters.

 A circuit judge on Monday rejected efforts to block a new trial for a convicted rapist who is on parole and whose victim recanted her charges four years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> ruled that genetic test results obtained by <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s attorneys constitute important new evidence. He denied two motions by prosecutors to dismiss a petition for a new trial. Defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said the ruling paves the way for a trial that will finally vindicate <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>. `` It's great,'' <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said after the hearing. `` We're 90 percent there.'' But Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Shines </PERSON> said it was speculation to talk of a new trial. She said the state will outline its position at a hearing Aug. 14. At that point, <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> will schedule a hearing that likely will determine whether a new trial will take place. Ms. <PERSON> Shines </PERSON> said prosecutors have not decided what approach to take regarding the evidence that <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s attorneys say proves he did not rape <PERSON> Cathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said genetic-test results prove that semen found on the underpants worn by Ms. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> the night in July 1977 when she said she was raped was not <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s. But Ms. <PERSON> Shines </PERSON> said the defense has failed to prove the test results have `` a substantial probability'' of changing the outcome of the original trial, a requirement for granting a new trial based on new evidence. And under state law, evidence of semen is not required to prove that a rape occurred, she said. `` Evidence that <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was not the seminal donor can not by itself change the results of the trial,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shines </PERSON> said. She also argued that the statute of limitations on a bid for a new trial expired two years after <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s 1979 conviction on charges of rape and aggravated kidnapping. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> rejected the argument, noting <PERSON> Breen </PERSON>'s petition contends that some evidence in the case was fraudulently concealed, which would override the law. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was not present, but a sister attended the hearing. `` We're going to prove once and for all that he did n't do it,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, 26. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> was sentenced to a 25 - to 50-year prison term after his conviction But in 1985, Ms. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> recanted her testimony. Now a <PERSON> Jaffrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, homemaker, she said she made up the attack because she feared she had become pregnant by her boyfriend. Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> clemency, saying his punishment had been sufficient. But the governor said he did not believe Ms. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s about-face, and has refused to pardon <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, 32, remains in an alcoholism treatment center as a condition of his parole last August. He had been returned to prison in December 1987 for a parole violation. Since his 1985 release, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> has had recurring minor problems with the law, mostly driving violations. He also had faced two misdemeanor battery charges, one stemming from an altercation in a bar and the other prompted by an allegation of abuse from his wife. Both charges were dropped. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> married shortly after his release. The couple have a daughter.

 A man suspected of spying for the Soviets walked through the woods behind his daughter's home Monday, jumped into the car she was driving and headed south, followed by a parade of federal autos. `` We knew he was there and that he left,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchila </PERSON>.

 A federal appeals court is reconsidering <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Topeka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> after withdrawing a recent ruling in which it revived the historic case, a court official said Monday. The 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> last week withdrew its June 2 decision in the desegregation case without explanation. `` It's as if there had been no opinion ever filed,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoecker </PERSON>, the court's clerk. `` They will reconsider the case.'' <PERSON> Hoecker </PERSON> said he did not know if the court would hold new hearings or base the new decision on existing testimony and evidence. He also said he did not know why the decision was made. Attorneys in the case said they found out about the withdrawal Friday and were unsure what the action means for the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, school system. `` This is purely my speculation. I think somewhere in the dissent someone is criticizing somebody else, and the majority wants an opportunity to respond to that criticism,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> lawyer who represents the plaintiffs in the 35-year-old case. In 1987, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> ruled that <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>'s public school district no longer had any illegal or intentional separation of races. In June, the appeals court overturned <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' ruling, saying the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> school system had not done enough to overcome remnants of the segregated school system that existed before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided the landmark <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Topeka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> case in 1954. The appeals court ordered <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> to devise a remedy for what it called the racially identifiable schools in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> said he and his staff are still unsure what the appeals court action means, and he will be meeting with attorneys. The 1954 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision held that the `` separate but equal'' concept for public schools was unconstitutional. The case was reopened in 1979 when the parents of 17 <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> public schoolchildren sought a decision on whether the schools had eliminated traces of the segregated system. The parents included <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, who as a student in 1954 gave the case its name.

 ABC News made `` a terrible mistake'' when it did not clearly label photos shown on its evening news show as a staged reenactment of a spying investigation, a network official said Monday. The blunder in Friday's `` World News Tonight,'' segment on veteran <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diplomat <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, might have led some viewers to believe that they were watching videotaped frames of <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> giving a briefcase to a Soviet agent. But the network's two still pictures of the transaction were created by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> staffers and were not taken from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> footage of an alleged <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> encounter with a Soviet agent in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> has not been charged with any wrongdoing, but he has been placed on leave and has had his diplomat's building pass and security clearances revoked. `` It was a terrible mistake'' not to identify clearly the news simulation as such, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday in a telephone interview. `` I regret it.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> defended reenactments in general, saying they should be seen as extensions of courtroom sketches. At least one media critic took a different point of view. `` I think that -LRB- recreations -RRB- are pure poison,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagdikian </PERSON>, the former dean of the graduate journalism school at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. `` Since the Fox network got its ratings with ` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,' it's clearly an imitation of that. It's docudrama as news.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> simulation lasted about 10 seconds and included two grainy, still shots of one man handing a briefcase to another. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McWethy </PERSON>'s narration at the time said `` it was not until earlier this year that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was videotaped handing over a briefcase to a known Soviet agent on the streets of a European capital.'' The sequence failed to include a `` simulation'' advisory in the upper left corner of the screen, as is customary and required practice of the network. The staged frames were followed by a brief videotape of a street scene, with two men walking across an intersection. The video featured a running time code in the lower right corner and a blinking cross hair, suggesting real surveillance footage. That scene was clearly labeled as a simulation. Later that same evening, in a subsequent transmission of the Peter Jennings-anchored newscast, the `` simulation'' credit was present for all of the newscast's reenactments. <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> said that the majority of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> affiliates used the first version, without the simulation notice. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> newsroom guidelines say it should be made explicitly clear that the audience is watching a news simulation, according to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Elise </PERSON> <PERSON> Adde </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Reports Gaugin Painting Stolen From Heathrow Airport</HEAD>

 Police said Monday they are investigating the reported theft from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport of a <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaugin </PERSON> painting owned by the Beadlestone Gallery of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the painting was valued at more than $ 1.9 million and was stolen from a cargo hangar at the airport. It said the watercolor measuring nine inches by four inches is titled `` Tahitienne en <ORGANIZATION> Pareo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'' _ Tahitian woman in a red skirt. <PERSON> Gaugin </PERSON>, a Frenchman born in 1848, lived and painted in <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> from 1895 until his death in 1903. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard, in a brief statement about the reported theft, said, `` The matter is the subject of an inquiry by the <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> said the painting was one of four pictures that arrived at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> on a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on June 21. It said the consignment remained in the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> cargo hangar until the owners arrived to collect them five days later. Each painting was in a separate box and only the one containing the <PERSON> Gaugin </PERSON> painting was missing, according to the newspaper. It gave no information about the three other painting. The Daily Mail said the theft was not reported to police until Sunday, but it gave no reason for the delayed report. It quoted the Beadlestone Gallery's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidel </PERSON> as saying: `` It is a work of art of the very finest quality. It was to have been part of an exhibition at our <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> gallery.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday allowed <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to proceed with its $ 14 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> dropped its $ 12.2 billion hostile bid for Time. The ruling paves the way for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to create the world's largest communications concern, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Paramount and some of Time's shareholders had asked a three-justice state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> panel to overturn a ruling by <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> Like many of the other biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and Paramount are incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and subject to its laws. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> had ruled that the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> deal announced in March, three months before <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> launched its bid, was the result of long-term business planning and that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and Time's shareholders could not interfere <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, an attorney for some of the <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, said that because Monday's ruling upholding <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was unanimous, the decision would not be appealed to the full state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which has five justices. Paramount issued a statement saying it was ending its bid for Time but would continue to try to expand. `` We believe in making bold moves when they are in the best interest of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> shareholders,'' <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` We have just demonstrated that in our offer for Time ...'' Time's $ 70-a-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> expired at 5 p.m. EDT and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> announced it held more than 117 million <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shares, or about 58 percent of the company's outstanding common stock. Time said it would announce Tuesday the exact number of shares tendered under its offer. Under the offer, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> was to purchase slightly more than half of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock and exchange a combination of cash and securities valued at $ 70 a share for the rest. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> said it would begin paying for the tendered shares on July 31. Investors sold off Time stock during Monday's hearing _ which was televised live by <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. The company's shares were down $ 1.25 to $ 137.25 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading after the decision was announced. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1 to $ 66.50 a share and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> was up 87 -LCB- cents to $ 58.37 -LCB- a share. Time said its plans to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would give shareholders greater value in the long term than <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 200-a-share offer. Paramount argued that the Warner-Time deal was economically inferior to its offer and detrimental to Time shareholders. The justices closely questioned Paramount and Time shareholder attorneys during the hearing. Justice <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> G.T </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, an attorney for some of Time's biggest shareholders, if they were demanding that `` we must hold that a board is hostage to any person who walks in and makes a bid no matter what the long-term plans are.'' The justices asked <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON> why the $ 70-a-share offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> _ which replaced an earlier stock-swap merger plan _ was not submitted to a vote by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders at the company's annual meeting in June. <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON> said a vote was not required because the deal did not involve the issuing of new Time stock. Paramount attorney <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON> contended that <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law required Time's board to inquire into <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s bid, and noted the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a previous case had `` held that the failure to inquire is gross negligence.'' Time defended the right of its directors to determine the company's future course, and said previous <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> cases allow a board to refuse to consider offers that threaten long-term plans. Time will pay $ 70 per share for half of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s 200 million outstanding shares. Time will later exchange $ 70 in a combination of cash and securities for the remaining shares. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported that about 500 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> executives and employees would be paid a total of about $ 677 million under stock, option and bonus plans if the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> goes through. The Journal said the payments, disclosed in minutes of a <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> board meeting June 15, amounted to the largest compensation package for employees of a company involved in a takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> would receive $ 193 million in payments and would also receive options on 1.8 million <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shares, the Journal said.

 Hazardous materials experts reassured hundreds of displaced families Monday that fumes from a chemical fire wo n't hurt their homes, and one official said even garden vegetables will be edible. The experts were monitoring a burning tank car that forced officials to keep a 15 square-mile area cordoned off for a third day Monday. Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> railroad spokesman reported that the brakeman on the <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> freight train, which derailed Saturday, checked himself into a local hospital's substance abuse program that night. Within hours of the derailment, the brakeman and other crew members submitted blood and urine samples for federally required drug and alcohol testing, said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON>, senior manager of news and information for the railroad. The brakeman later told railroad officials he wanted to enter the hospital's drug and alcohol abuse program, <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> emphasized that human error had been ruled out as a cause of the derailment, and that brakeman's decision was n't expected to alter that. The brakeman was riding in the first of two locomotives pulling tank cars on a run from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> and was not at the controls when the train derailed, said <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Test results on the entire crew were expected later this week, <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said. Some people forced from their homes by the fiery derailment, meanwhile, said they wanted to move even if everything is OK. `` I've always had a gut feeling something would happen I've always looked at those tank cars and wondered what kind of poison was in them,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Siminski </PERSON>, 77, who lives near the railroad tracks `` My wife and I are talking about getting out. I do n't know if we'll be able to sell now.'' <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Gott </PERSON>, who lives three-quarters of a mile from the derailment, said she also wants to move. `` I do n't think I'll feel safe,'' she said. `` You do n't know what that stuff is.'' The tracks where the derailment occurred have been used for more than 10 years to carry toxic chemicals between <ORGANIZATION> Freeport </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and nearby <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, on a regularly scheduled run known as the Unit Train. Experts decided Monday to speed up the burning of the chemical by pumping air into the car and boosting the fire, which burst from a gash in the car. The chemical, chlorosilene, emits hydrochloric acid as it burns, but <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Buser </PERSON>, director of hazardous materials for <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION>, said the amounts were low and were dissipating into the air. <PERSON> Buser </PERSON> said it was impossible to tell how long it would take the chemical to burn away, but he said he believed little was left in the tank car. At the car, the amount of acid in the air was within safety limits and 150 yards away monitors detected none, he said, adding that houses, cars, and other personal possessions would n't be damaged. Food from gardens would be safe after it was thoroughly washed, said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said 250 to 350 people had registered with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to get the railroad to pay for motel rooms, meals and clothing. Other evacuees had gone to stay with friends and relatives, <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said. The railroad also will pay businesses forced to close by the evacuation and reimburse pay lost by those unable to go to work, he added. Investigators from <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said it was too early to determine the cause of the crash. Calls for slower speeds for trains carrying hazardous materials were answered by the state government Monday. `` Train speed is just one factor. You could have equipment failure contributing to it also. You ca n't say that speed, whether it's going 25 or 40 mph, would be a contributing factor. The track condition is good for 40 mph,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riel </PERSON>, assistant administrator of the Rail Safety and Traffic Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. The train was traveling at 37 mph when it derailed, officials said.

 The Turkish Cypriot government released early Tuesday all 82 <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cypriot </ORGANIZATION> women who were jailed six days ago for staging an anti-Turkish demonstration. Hundreds of Greek Cypriots, including President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, welcomed the women at the police academy in the Greek Cypriot sector of the divided capital. Sobbing with relief the freed women sang the Greek national anthem to the cheers of the welcoming crowd. The women were driven to the academy in a convoy of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peace-force buses following their release from a prison in the Turkish-occupied zone of <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. A total of 108 Greek Cypriots _ 98 women and 10 men _ were arrested Wednesday on the 15th anniversary of the Turkish invasion while demonstrating in the U.N.-buffer zone dividing the east Mediterranean island. They were charged with violating the border of the Turkish Cypriot state, which is recognized only by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Sixteen girls, all under the age of 18, were released Sunday and Monday. The 10 men, including <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrysostomos </PERSON>, another Greek Orthodox priest, a doctor and two journalists, are still held. The release of the women followed mass demonstrations by Greek Cypriots and a 5-day sit-in blocking the main entrance to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters by hundreds of women. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on Thursday called for the release of all of the prisoners. He also cricized both the Greek Cypriot demonstrators and the <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> police for entering the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> buffer zone. <PERSON> Eleni </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrahimi </PERSON>, a lawyer and one of the organizers of Wednesday's demonstration, said she and all of the other prisoners had been `` severely beaten'' by Turkish Cypriot police `` The trial before a Turkish Cypriot court was a mockery and a parody of justice,'' she said. `` There are no borders in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and we were protesting the Turkish occupation in the yards of a Greek Cypriot school and a church when the Turkish forces seized us.'' <PERSON> Vassilou </PERSON> told the crowd, `` The release of the women shows that humanity is not prepared to accept the violation of human rights.'' He expressed hope the 10 men would be freed soon. The conflict caused by the demonstration and arrests threatened to wreck the 11-month-old U.N.-sponsored peace talks between <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> and Turkish Cypriot leader <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> on reunification of the island. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and seized 40 percent of its territory. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> said the troops were sent to protect the Turkish Cypriots who comprise 17 percent of the island's population. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> launched the invasion after a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking a union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.

 The Cabinet on Monday approved a proposal by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to allocate $ 137.5 million for a public works program designed to reduce the country's high unemployment. The decision came a day after about 1 million civil servants, bank employees and airport and factory workers walked off their jobs for two hours to protest the worsening job situation. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in May, the highest since a 1965-67 recession when the rate reached 12.4 percent. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said funds for the public works program would come from other areas and overall budget spending would not increase. He said he planned to cut $ 30 million from the budget of the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> and would trim other programs. `` I'm afraid of an increase in inflation and, therefore, we will see to it that the budget will not grow,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. He said the plan would target `` development towns'' most affected by unemployment. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> began creating development towns in the 1950s to house Jewish immigrants, mostly from North African and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> countries. `` The whole program stresses the development towns problems in at least three fields: Infrastructure of roads, water systems and schools,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON>, former finance minister, said the plan `` would not really help to ease unemployment,'' and he called for a more comprehensive economic plan.

<HEAD>House Republicans Claim Reform Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republican campaign warriors in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> are trying to open a second front in their bid to cut the clout of incumbents, hoping that voter cynicism about <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> itself will work against Democrats in 1990. Demanding campaign finance reforms that would undo some of the advantages incumbents enjoy when they seek re-election, Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> whip, and his deputies say they are not going to settle for less than a full overhaul of campaign and ethics laws just to get an agreement with the Democratic majority. Since the parties do n't and probably wo n't agree on what to do and exactly how to go about it, that makes Democratic support unlikely. That would make legislation improbable if not impossible, leading to phase two of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> battle plan, which is to try to identify Republicans with reform, and to make that a major national issue in the 1990 congressional campaign. There are certain flaws in the plan. One is that the top Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, is publicly committed to action this year on ethics and campaign reform. That hardly gives the Republicans a bye on the issue. But <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> contends that what the Democrats would do is not adequate, and would be more public relations than real reform. Then, too, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> is not without its own problems on ethics and reform. A Republican administration produced improprieties and influence peddling in federal housing programs, now under congressional investigation. In addition, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> himself faces a possible investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee in connection with a 1984 book promotion deal. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who lodged the ethics charges that led to the downfall of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, said the accusations against him are baseless. He called them `` an attack on me for blowing the whistle on <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.'' He said neither party had the franchise for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandals. But testimony about influence peddling by big-name Republicans can hardly be helpful in a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> quest for the reform mantle in the next campaign. `` We still believe that the issue of reform is our issue,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., who serves on a bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> task force that is considering campaign finance and ethics reforms <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON> said surveys reflecting widespread mistrust of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as an institution are an indication that incumbency could carry liabilities in 1990. In a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> controlled by Democrats, 257 to 175, with three vacancies, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> theory is that the majority suffers most. That theory will get preview tests this summer in special elections to fill the seats left open by the death of Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and by the resignations of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the Democratic whip. The real push for position on the reform issue will come later. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has said he will press the reform quest after leaders of both parties get the recommendations of the special task force. But those recommendations wo n't mean much if there is partisan stalemate on major campaign finance questions. While <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> contends that `` any real reform hurts the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> whip and his deputies do not sound as though they would be dismayed to have an issue rather than a bill. Their tactics illustrate a generation gap among House Republicans. The old <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> school was one of negotiation and compromise with the controlling Democrats. That's the only way a chronic minority can shape legislation. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> contends that his more confrontational style is the way out of minority status, toward capturing the control Republicans have not had in 35 years. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is the party of the entrenched incumbent,'' he said at a luncheon with reporters and deputy GOP whips. `` ... It is truly dangerous for the country to have this kind of incumbency advantage.'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said real reform legislation will change that, and Republicans will not make a deal for anything less. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> rejected any partial approach to reform, arguing that the Democrats could use that to defuse the ethics issue in the 1990 campaign. `` We're not going to give them an inexpensive ticket to masquerade behind,'' he said. He said that unless there is fundamental reform in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should veto the legislative appropriations bill that provides funds to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. That would n't settle anything, but it certainly would fuel the debate on reform as a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> heads into the 1990 campaign season. And that fits the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> game plan. `` The Democrats are conceding the issue to us,'' <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassmer </PERSON> ordered a shipment of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> key chains and cigarette lighters for their general store in plenty of time for any crowds this year. It's what they did n't order 20 years ago this summer that still causes a few pangs of regret. The shelves of their country store were nearly stripped bare that August 15-17 when about a half million youngsters camped out nearly two miles away at the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> music festival. For one long weekend Vassmer's, open since 1911 on the shores of <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> to serve residents of this 6,000-population town, operated like an exclusive nightclub. Bouncers stood at the front door and let customers in a few dozen at a time to shop. `` If I'd known, I would have had 50 cases of peanut butter up front and said, ` there you go, take all you want,''' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassmer </PERSON>. The Vassmers never made it up to <PERSON> Yasgur </PERSON>'s farm during the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> festival in 1969 when flower children frolicked in the mud and listened to The Who, <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> and others. They were too busy. But they could hear the music wafting through the air at all hours of the day and night. `` I did n't believe it would come off,'' <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassmer </PERSON> said, `` and I still do n't believe it was here.'' The Vassmers remember kids abandoning their cars in town late Thursday night, sitting on hoods and playing guitars and camping out in the streets and nearby fields at night. <PERSON> Vassmer </PERSON>'s, the closest store to the festival site, had n't even ordered any extra provisions. All of their canned goods were prized items, along with the peanut butter. Despite the crowds, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> said he does n't remember any shoplifters and none of the 25 checks he cashed bounced. `` They did n't bother anybody,'' <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> said. `` They were no problem. I'm sure a lot of them were on drugs, but they helped each other out. If one kid did n't have enough money, someone else would give him some.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassmer </PERSON> said he dropped about 12 pounds over three days, mostly because he could n't bear to turn on his light and cook something in his apartment above the store with so many hungry kids on the street below. The couple love reminiscing about the festival with visitors, but they know enough not to bring up the name `` <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>'' to longtime <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> residents. `` It's not a good topic for conversation because people who were against it, they still feel the same way they did then,'' said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassmer </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> and the surrounding <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> region has let it be known they're not particularly sentimental for the 20th anniversary. <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> refused offers from promoters to be host to an anniversary concert, even when businessmen dangled enticements such as paying for a new town sewer system. Town officials are expecting several thousand people to show up at the former <PERSON> Yasgur </PERSON> farm for the anniversary. The concert was originally planned for the town of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, about 50 miles away, but moved when promoters could n't get permission to hold it. At <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> today, cynical store owners sell T-shirts with a map of the area making clear the festival took place in <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, not in the famous arts colony. The Vassmers are part of a contingent of <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> residents who wish the town could cash in on its place in history by more actively seeking tourists, but anti-festival opinion has held sway. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassmer </PERSON> said some people still wander into the general store and recognize him from the movie `` <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>,'' in which he was interviewed. Some even ask for autographs, which still leaves him tickled. His store, with the worn wooden floorboards, has n't changed much since 1969 Times have, though, and that's why he ca n't see a repeat performance of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. `` Today you could n't do it,'' he said. `` It's a different attitude. These people were the peace people. They came up here for love and peace and music and that's what they got.''

 Now and then when her daughters were babies, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiner </PERSON> would wander the landscapes of their bodies with her hands. `` I could feel them and know exactly who had a short nose and who had long fingers. It was neat.'' Now <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> is 5 and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> 3, too big to sit still for such things. But the memory came back recently as <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> applied calamine lotion. The actual location of their chicken pox rash eluded her, but `` I just put it all over them. That way, I figured I'd hit it.'' Which pretty much sums up the common sense, humor and love <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiner </PERSON> brings to raising two children she can not see. She's been blind all her life, but that never stopped her from learning to bicycle, ski or sail. It never stopped her from going to college, graduating with honors or earning a master's degree. Nor did it stop her from falling in love, with a deep-voiced, articulate man eight years her senior. At the <ORGANIZATION> Perkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for the Blind outside <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> boarded from age 5, `` you were encouraged to date sighted guys.'' `` We had socials. They would bring in sighted kids, but then you'd never see them again. The idea was you should marry someone with a pair of eyes to drive you around and read to you and take care of you.'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> married <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiner </PERSON>, legally blind from birth. Which pretty much sums up her attitude about being cared for. The Shiners' snug, red-shingled house has an ambiance any parent can appreciate, from the crunch of a stray Cheerio in the kitchen to the deflating balloons strewn about the living room, stragglers from <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>'s birthday party. Counting the <PERSON> Shiner </PERSON> kids, the guest list numbered nine. Outside is the timeless small-town summer symphony of chattering children, barking dogs and hissing lawn sprinklers, punctuated by slamming screen doors. Each time the Shiners' door opens, a bell rings. `` On the first warm day of the year, when we all opened our doors for the first time, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> kept running out,'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> explains. Today, there's also the steady drone of the TV in the <PERSON> Shiner </PERSON> living room, a rare concession to chicken pox by a mother faced with entertaining two house-bound kids, a visitor, and a bored German shepherd. She serves coffee to the visitor, cheese puffs and juice to the girls, then pours herself a cup of tea and sinks into a kitchen chair. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiner </PERSON> has already strapped on his backpack and set off for <LOCATION> Montpelier </LOCATION>'s lone supermarket, a two-mile round trip he makes every other day. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> likes to cook and has a well-stocked freezer, with a braille map. On a normal day, <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> would be outdoors by now, riding bikes, blowing bubbles or playing with other kids. Lunch is a prelude to `` quiet time,'' followed by outings to the pool or the library with <PERSON> Seltzer </PERSON> the guide dog in the lead. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> grips <PERSON> Seltzer </PERSON>'s harness and <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> pushes <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>'s stroller, a formation perfected over time. `` <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> will help me report stores as we walk downtown, if I go past where I wanted to go,'' says <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, 36, a slender woman with youthful good looks and a friendly, confident manner. Other animals tend to be <PERSON> Seltzer </PERSON>'s downfall, and `` <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> has learned to spot them a block away. She'll yell ` I see a dog! I see a cat!' `` Probably 10 years from now I'll look back and say ` How did I do it?''' For the time being, however, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> would much rather be called `` ordinary'' than `` amazing,'' as in, `` Is n't she amazing? She can walk down the street with her kids and her dog!'' <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> find <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> every bit as ordinary as most small children regard their parents. `` Mommy is blind and she ca n't see and <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON> is blind and he can see a little,'' <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> explains, in the slightly exasperated voice of big sisters everywhere. The interview ends abruptly, as the subject loses interest and wanders back to `` Sesame Street.'' <PERSON> Esther </PERSON>, immaculate in <LOCATION> Oshkosh </LOCATION> overalls, is the studious one, with thoughtful dark eyes, a neat cap of brown hair and dimples like her mother's. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>'s a disheveled escape artist, hazel-eyed, round-faced and rambunctious. Both girls report each other's mischief except in cases of conspiracy, as when, in the interest of science, they snuck a little extra baking powder into their mother's cookie dough. `` They were really yucky,'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> says cheerfully. `` We ate them anyway.'' In the living room, the sound of crunching cheese puffs stops abruptly, and <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> pipes up right on cue. `` <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>'s stuffing her cheeks, Mommy.'' `` Do n't stuff your cheeks, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> relies on a combination of intuition and hearing to tell her when her kids are up to something. Like most mothers, she's seldom wrong `` They get sat in the chair when I think they're doing something.'' The most common chair-sitting offense at the moment: `` Looking out the window at neighbors who do n't go to bed when they do.'' <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> wanders into the kitchen scrunching a brown paper bag. `` Sometimes I do this to bags,'' she says solemnly, then dissolves into giggles as her mother swoops down and scoops her up in a hug. `` Sometimes I do this to little girls,'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> tells her.

 Time to color. <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> sit at the table while <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> fetches their coloring books and crayons, stored, along with puzzles, games and cards, in separate bags in her bedroom closet. The kids' clothes are neatly folded in their dressers. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> pins the shirts and pants together before she washes them, to keep her girls color - coordinated As the girls grow, so does the Shiners' library. `` I spend half my time figuring out how to get books,'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> says. `` I'm really envious of mothers in the library who can just pick up any book and read it to their kids.'' She also envies parents who can follow the puppet shows, finger plays and craft demonstrations at play groups and story hours. `` Group situations are real hard. Everyone can look at the teacher and I ca n't.'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> uses a leash to keep track of <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> in the pool during swimming lessons. `` <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> is more compliant, but we talk to <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> a lot about boundaries. She'd wind up in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calais </LOCATION> if we did n't.'' Plans for a new fence in the back yard attest to the wanderlust of the youngest <PERSON> Shiner </PERSON>. Lunchtime. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> fixes tuna sandwiches, scraping carrots to serve on the side. Everything has its place in her kitchen _ pots, pans, utensils. Temperature settings on her oven dials are specially marked, as are the microwave and egg timer. Spices are labeled in braille. Joining hands for grace is a Shiner ritual. So is the story hour that follows the meal. The girls cuddle next to <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> on the sofa. <PERSON> Seltzer </PERSON>'s tail thumps the carpet as she curls up at their feet. `` A guide dog is like another child,'' says <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, who rises early to put the big shepherd through her paces. `` Her training is very intensive and I have to keep up with it.'' Boredom is an occupational hazard for a dog trained in big-city traffic, then assigned to <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> is skilled at using a cane, but `` a cane is an extension of your hand. For half the year in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, all your landmarks are covered up. A dog is a living partner.'' At the Shiners', she's also a pet For the next half-hour, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> reads Bible stories to <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> has her own copy of the book and follows along, mouthing the words, her fingers brushing the print as her mother's skim over the braille. Frank returns from the market, laden with provisions. `` I'm putting the girls' shampoo under the sink,'' he calls `` Where's lunch? `` On the counter, to the right of the sink.'' The story continues, followed by a token attempt at a nap. Finally, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> relents: The girls may play quietly in the yard. Raising two children without benefit of one's sight might seem overwhelming to some people, but <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> says it never really fazed her much. `` We worried some, but we tend to face problems as they come up, one day at a time, one stage at a time. `` If I could see, I'd have to figure out from scratch how to be a sighted person. I'm used to listening, to using my other senses. If I could see for a day, I'd like to see what colors look like, what a sunset looks like. Then I would give it up.'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>'s blindness was caused by too much oxygen given her and her twin sister <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> following their premature birth. Some of <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s sight was saved, since she was slightly bigger and was removed from the isolette first <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> suffered optic nerve damage and sees only darkness. Nevertheless, as a child growing up in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, `` <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> did n't miss out on anything,'' says her mother, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbberts </PERSON>. `` If <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> got a coloring book and crayons, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> got a coloring book and crayons. When <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> got a two-wheeler, <PERSON> Jeannie </PERSON> did too.'' <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s mother, thinks the anti-nausea medicine she took during pregnancy may have caused her son's blindness. Two months after his birth, her sighted husband abandoned the family. Mrs. <PERSON> Shiner </PERSON>, who also is blind, earned a living managing a snack bar in a <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> state office building. Mainstreaming had not yet been envisioned, but `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> was allowed to do whatever the other kids did. I brought him up to be independent.'' It never occurred to <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> not to have children, though <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> waited until she was pregnant to tell her mother. Both families shared the new parents' joy and relief when <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> were born fully sighted. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> quit her job counseling disabled people to be a full-time mother, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> took paternity leave from his job producing a radio show for the Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Employment of the Handicapped. A public health nurse supervised <PERSON> Esther </PERSON>'s first bath and feeding, but then the Shiners were on their own. Despite all the baby books <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> studied during pregnancy, `` I discovered that I did n't know anything about raising a child before I had one _ and neither did a lot of sighted people.'' For all its joys, parenthood is also a time of great vulnerability for the Shiners. Because they walk everywhere they go, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> keeps the girls indoors when the temperature drops below zero. But otherwise, `` we are out there, visible, whatever the weather,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> says. `` Most people ride by in their cars and their kid is in a car seat strapped into the back with the door locked and the window rolled up.'' Despite his communications degree and experience, steady work in radio has eluded <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> during the 10 years since the state stopped funding his show. `` In the past, I've sold myself short, working just to say I have a job.'' The Shiners get by on disability benefits, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> keeps busy with various disability rights organizations, but he struggles with the toll joblessness has taken on his confidence. Rather then take another `` survival'' job, he's chosen to help raise his daughters until satisfying work comes along. `` I read with them, I take time with them, I try to make the most of it. It's an opportunity a lot of guys do n't get.'' For <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, acceptance by other mothers is an ongoing struggle. `` They can put their kid in someone's car but they think twice about letting me pick up their child. I'm always having to earn their trust, to remind people: I'm blind, but I'm a person just like you.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ In vast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, highways are scarce, villages remote and cars have limited use. Get a horse? No, get an airplane. Here's one man's crusade to honor the aviation pioneers in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s flyingest state.

 The remains of the airplane lay rotting in the slimy thicket of a gulch, wings clipped, tail shorn, body stove in, a sorry looking carcass guarded by squadrons of bloodthirsty mosquitoes. To <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> it shone like a jewel. `` It can be restored,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> was saying, stalking the remains, nodding. `` Yes, it can.'' His boots made sucking sounds as he bounded around in the muck snapping pictures, oblivious to the mosquitoes, his glee obvious. `` I heard about this airplane last year and did n't believe it was true. When I came and saw it for myself, saw ` Ptarmigan II' painted on its nose, my heart leapt Look, you can still read it.'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> is the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> which occupies a corner of the Anchorage airport. At 42, he couples a childlike exuberance for airplanes with a professorial knowledge of them, especially airplanes of the Ptarmigan II vintage. His aim is to document, through records and artifacts, one of the most colorful periods in American history, the 20 years before World War II when `` The Aviation,'' as it was called, came to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The old airplanes themselves, of course, are the prime artifacts. A proud array of them, restored to look like new, contrast handsomely with their modern counterparts flying overhead. `` What those aviation pioneers did in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> was no less extraordinary,'' says <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, `` than men landing on the moon. What they accomplished had immediate effects, and they were more significant in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> than the advent of aviation in any other state. They liberated <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s last frontier.'' Flying out to <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> recently _ there being no other way to cover the 275 miles from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> pointed out the window to a beach on the <LOCATION> Kuskokwim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near the village of <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>. As if to document his own claim, he scribbled a note to his fellow passenger: `` <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Eielson </PERSON> flew first airmail to that spot Feb. 1924. Single-engine DeHavilland DH-4. Open cockpit. Came from Fairbanks. Three-hour flight in winter.'' Before <ORGANIZATION> Eielson </ORGANIZATION>'s flight it took 20 days to make that 300-mile mail run by dog team. You can see a photograph of <ORGANIZATION> Eielson </ORGANIZATION> and his airplane at the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>. More out of continuing necessity than nostalgia for those glory days of epic feats, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> has remained by far the flyingest state in the nation. According to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> figures, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, per capita, has eight times as many pilots and 15 times as many planes as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> average. It works out to one pilot for every 55 Alaskans and one plane for every 57. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s 9,682 licensed pilots average 132 flying hours a year compared with a national average, including <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, of 49 hours. <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> is the world's largest seaplane base. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION>, which handles only general aviation _ light planes for personal and charter use _ is busier than the international airports in <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` It's hard for people who have n't experienced <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to visualize its vastness and its terrain,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Steuke </PERSON>. `` We have only about 533,000 people, most of them scattered in settlements that would be utterly isolated without the airplane. Our few roads, very few, are like streams without tributaries, you ca n't get to them. Even if you could, they're often impassable in winter. `` Add to that four huge mountain ranges and unpredictable weather systems boiling out of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Even skilled pilots have to stay on their toes in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>.'' How much more so, says <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, for the aviation pioneers who established that almost mythic breed known as <PERSON> bush </PERSON> pilots. During the 1920s and 1930s they became the most popular and honored men in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>.

 `` Imagine flying out over uncharted territory through narrow mountain passes in open cockpits with no maps, no weather reports, no radios, no landing strips, no places to refuel.'' Eskimos saw airplanes long before they saw automobiles and came to regard the pilots as paracletes. They brought medicine to the villages, fresh fruit, locations of caribou herds, news of relatives in other settlements. They took trappers into the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> and came back on appointed days to fetch them. They hauled miners and supplies to gold camps, hauled the sick to hospitals. A pilot named <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> hauled a cow from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> so an ailing baby in <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> could have fresh milk. A pilot named <PERSON> Sig </PERSON> <PERSON> Wien </PERSON> hauled a chessboard on his 90-mile trips between Point Lay and <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> so two distant friends could have a game. By 1939, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s small airplanes and hearty pilots were hauling 23 times as many passengers per capita as the airlines of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 1,000 times as much freight. Empty wooden boxes labeled Stanavo Gas, each of which held two five-gallon cans of airplane fuel, littered the countryside. Stacked in outposts and trapper's cabins, they came to be known as <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> cupboards. On a stopover at Flat on the way to <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> found a Stanavo box in good shape and brought it back with him. `` If I do n't find things like this myself they might not be found,'' he said. `` We do n't have much help and the museum is practically broke. We're in a constant financial crisis.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON>, who is 71, was born in a mining camp at Flat, about eight miles from <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, and remembers when The Aviation reached there. `` It opened up a whole new era.'' He also remembers when <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> <PERSON> Post </PERSON> crash-landed there in 1933 _ safely, but it was a close call. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> videotaped <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON>'s recollection of the episode It was <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON> who told <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> about the abandoned remains of the plane at <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, how the pilot had salvaged the plane's engines after a crash and left the rest. The boxy fuselage, <PERSON> Miscovich </PERSON> said, had for a time served as a makeshift toolshed before it finally wound up in the gulch. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> has in his museum files the history of very nearly every bush plane the pioneer airmen flew. `` I knew the Ptarmigan II was a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tri-Motor </ORGANIZATION>, probably the first in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. In fact, I had a picture of it, and of its pilot, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorbandt </PERSON>. `` Dorbandt bought it from an air service in the States which had named it West Wind II. It was built in 1928. <PERSON> Dorbandt </PERSON> bought it in 1934, brought it to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and renamed it Ptarmigan II. There never was a Ptarmigan I. `` Dorbandt was one of the really early pilots. He participated in the search for <ORGANIZATION> Eielson </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Eielson </ORGANIZATION>, at age 32, had crashed in a storm over <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. His fellow <PERSON> bush </PERSON> pilots mounted a search and one of them, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosson </PERSON>, found the wreckage and <ORGANIZATION> Eielson </ORGANIZATION>'s body weeks later. Soviet airmen had also joined in the search and a Soviet ship returned the body to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, wrapped in an American flag sewn from red and blue muslin and white ship canvas. Beginning with <ORGANIZATION> Eielson </ORGANIZATION>'s crash in 1930, fully two-thirds of the planes in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> were wrecked beyond repair over the next 10 years. Less serious crackups were commonplace. In fact, pilots came to expect some minor damage on every landing. `` But they persevered,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> says. `` As a result we now have a fairly intricate network of air travel that unifies the whole state.'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> has arranged with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to fly out in a helicopter the first week in September and lift the remains of Ptarmigan II from the gulch at <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. It will join its brothers in that panoply of history, each in flying condition, each with its own contribution to a storied era that opened up a hostile land. `` Ptarmigan II will have a place of honor,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> says. `` It will fly again.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Shortly after they arrived at the remote valley in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> called the <LOCATION> Baca </LOCATION>, a local mountain man and `` prophet'' came down to visit <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON>. He told them they were on sacred ground where all the world's religions would gather to work for greater spiritual understanding. Today the Strong's are working to fulfill that prophecy.

 <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> unrolls her blueprint of a `` global village'' for spiritual leaders and environmentalists and pins its corners down on her kitchen table with an expensive tea set. It shows a band of temples and churches, gardens, and small, self-sufficient communities laid out along the foot of the <LOCATION> Sangre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristo </LOCATION> mountains here. Some of what's in the plan already has been realized, some is in the works, and some exists just in `` prophecy,'' Strong says. Like Strong, who travels the area's back roads in skirts and silk blouses as comfortably as in jeans, the plan is at once earthy and elegant, serious and a little spacey, embracing the disadvantaged one minute and industrial magnates and movie stars the next. `` Unenlightened, confused minds are ruling the world and destroying the environment,'' Strong says. `` There needs to be a major shift in the way people think.'' Strong and her husband, Canadian oil developer and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> diplomat <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON>, hope to turn several thousand acres of desert and mountains in southern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> into a repository of spiritual truth and environmentally sound living _ a place where political and business leaders can come to be taught how to care for themselves and the Earth. They do n't want a lot of people, who would tax the area's fragile natural balance The place, originally part of the 160,000-acre Baca Spanish land-grant ranch, is called just `` the <LOCATION> Baca </LOCATION>.'' Area Indians believed it to be sacred, `` neutral'' ground where tribes could come together. <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> believes it has kept that power intact. The <ORGANIZATION> Strongs </ORGANIZATION> already have given away hundreds of acres to Carmelite Catholics, Tibetan <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, Zen monks, <PERSON> American </PERSON> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> tribes and the yoga-based Sri Aurobindo Learning Center. They have put up chapels, hermitages, temples, sweat lodges, community buildings and gardens. On the blueprint, <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> has set aside 2,000 more choice acres for other religious groups she believes will come to the <PERSON> Baca </PERSON> someday as earlier groups did _ on their own. She does not recruit. A native of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> who personally feels closest to the American Indian spiritual tradition, Strong says she respects all spirituality but intends the Baca to be for religions with `` an unbroken lineage,'' not the so-called `` New Age'' groups. `` This is ` Old Age,''' she says with a laugh. `` Very old.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Strongs </ORGANIZATION> have sold land at the Baca to less-established spiritual groups, although not yet to actress <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>, a friend of Strong's who visits the <PERSON> Baca </PERSON> often and wants to set up a spiritual community here. One such group that bought land at the Baca is the <LOCATION> Haidakhandi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ashram </LOCATION>, which is building a Vedic temple and small community on 46 acres to follow the teachings of <PERSON> Haidakhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Babaji </PERSON>, a Hindu mystic. Other projects under way include an Experimental Garden and Seed Bank for high-altitude crops, an educational center for American Indian youth, a world nutritional center and various healing centers. Scattered among the spiritual groups and projects are about 100 homes, the beginnings of the <PERSON> Baca </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> retirement community that was cut short when the <ORGANIZATION> Strongs </ORGANIZATION> came to the area in 1979. Most of the Baca development remains a virtual wilderness, where a visitor sees more deer than people, and signs of mountain lion and bear. `` It's a complete ecosystem,'' Strong says. `` It's still in a pure state.'' The Baca, elevation 7,800 feet, can only be reached from the west. To the east rises a wall of craggy, snow-covered peaks rising to more than 14,000 feet, the Sangre de Cristos. Compared to the arid valley a traveler crosses to get here, much of the <PERSON> Baca </PERSON> is lush, traversed by creeks and shaded by tall trees. Some of the spiritual groups that have moved here actually were directed to the Baca by Hopi Indian elders. <PERSON> Cree </PERSON>, <PERSON> Blackfoot </PERSON>, Ute and <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> tribes have built ceremonial lodges at the Baca, and Navajos and Hopis make pilgrimages here. `` This is a sacred place, for hundreds, thousands of years,'' says <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sierra </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Pine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> reservation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, who travels to the <PERSON> Baca </PERSON> occasionally as an apprentice to a <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> medicine man. `` It's a place of power.'' The area's beauty inspires all the spiritual groups that have settled here. `` The desert and the mountains are deep religious symbols for every spiritual community, and right at the heart of the Carmelite philosophy,'' says Sister <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> at the Carmelite monastery, where the buildings blend into the landscape and are invisible from a distance. `` Aesthetics are very important to us for creating a contemplative climate ... Beauty uplifts the soul. It's part of the whole consciousness of this area _ respect or reverence for the Earth.'' The Carmelites, who moved to the <LOCATION> Baca </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Sedona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, in 1983 because of encroaching development, have 104 acres, including a mountain hermitage. Nine full-time hermits _ both men and women _ live at the <LOCATION> Baca </LOCATION>, and their numbers are growing. The order is negotiating to buy more property and has a waiting list of retreatants. The Baca is bordered on the north by <ORGANIZATION> Crestone </ORGANIZATION>, a tiny gold-mining town gone bust, and on the south by the Great Sand Dunes National Monument. To the west is the <LOCATION> Baca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION>, with more than 4,500 head of cattle. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> is the ranch's board chairman. <ORGANIZATION> Crestone </ORGANIZATION> is an hour from the nearest supermarket, in <LOCATION> Alamosa </LOCATION>, and half a day's drive from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, northeast over a couple of mountain ranges. <ORGANIZATION> Crestone </ORGANIZATION>'s post office was about to close in the early 1970s when the subdivision came along, followed several years later by the <ORGANIZATION> Strongs </ORGANIZATION>. Now about 200 people live in the town and adjoining development year-round, 300 in the summer. Residents include ranch hands and a handful of old-timers as well as retirees and those attracted either by the spiritual groups or by the chance to live in a small town with an international flavor. The tiny <ORGANIZATION> Crestone </ORGANIZATION> phone book is riddled with such entries as `` Crystal Sojourns'' and `` Ahimsa Lifestyle.'' It also includes some of the rich and famous the <ORGANIZATION> Strongs </ORGANIZATION> have brought to the area, including <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, former chairman of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Najeeb </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halaby </PERSON>, former head of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and father of the queen of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Halaby </PERSON> has built a home and ziggurat _ an ancient type of Assyrian temple _ on land he bought from the Strongs near the Sand Dunes. It is one tract in an area the <ORGANIZATION> Strongs </ORGANIZATION> divided into several tracts and allowed the non-denominational <ORGANIZATION> Lindisfarne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to sell to wealthy friends and acquaintances. One of them, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, is inviting hundreds of family members to set up a bedouin camp on his land, Strong says. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON>, the first chief of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> _ among other environmental credentials _ sees the <PERSON> Baca </PERSON> as an attempt `` to harmonize the people who affect the environment, who are the economic practitioners. The Strongs first came to the <LOCATION> Baca </LOCATION> in 1978 when <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> took control of <ORGANIZATION> AZL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owned the 146,000-acre <ORGANIZATION> Baca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> and the 14,000-acre <ORGANIZATION> Baca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, on which AZL had tried unsuccessfully since 1971 to develop a retirement resort. They were struck by the area's beauty and halted the retirement development. Under Strong, AZL began consolidating tracts of land, giving some to spiritual groups and selling some. The company merged with Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Tosco </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, and <ORGANIZATION> Tosco </ORGANIZATION> sold the <LOCATION> Baca </LOCATION> in 1986 to a group of investors led by Strong. Other investors include former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruckelshaus </PERSON>; Canadian financier <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON>; <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and his son <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, and others. That group still owns the ranch, but sold the development in 1987 to local developers. The <ORGANIZATION> Strongs </ORGANIZATION> own 20 percent of the ranch, and <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> has her 2,000 `` key acres'' along the mountains in a foundation called <LOCATION> Manitou </LOCATION>. In 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> Aspen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> set up a conference center, complete with restaurant, town houses and jogging trail, on 320 acres donated by the <ORGANIZATION> Strongs </ORGANIZATION> and AZL. The remoteness of the area prompted the institute to discontinue its programs there in 1984, but now <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, located 130 miles away in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, leases some of the town houses as a field school and dormitories. The Strongs, who are building a new solar-energy home, own one of the town houses in which <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> lives most of the year. The prophecy <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> follows is chiefly that of <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a local mountain man and `` prophet'' who came down into the valley and visited the <LOCATION> Strongs </LOCATION> two months after they arrived at the Baca. She says he told them they were on sacred ground where all the world's religions would gather to work for greater spiritual understanding. `` He said, ` That's what you're here for _ to do this,''' she says. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has since died. Strong asked elders from nine American Indian tribes to come to the <LOCATION> Baca </LOCATION> and hold a council on the prophecy. After four days, she said, `` They said the prophecy's correct.'' Of all the projects under way at the <LOCATION> Baca </LOCATION>, Strong herself is most excited about the fledgling <ORGANIZATION> RedSun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an `` <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indigenous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION>,'' and the 200-acre Tibetan Center, along with the agricultural research. `` Many Indian elders have been coming to this area for a long time,'' says <ORGANIZATION> RedSun </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Caverly </PERSON>, 38, who is seeking grants to get the institute going. She sees it as `` a gathering place for the traditional teachings to be passed on to the youth.'' Initial projects include building a village where students can come to learn about Indian spirituality and community development, and creating a `` Sustainable Development Youth Corps'' dedicated to restoring and protecting the Earth. Strong's ties to the Tibetans run deep. She says her grandson, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Alamosa </LOCATION> in 1979, was recognized by the High Lama in 1981 as the reincarnation of an 11th-century Tibetan saint named <PERSON> Rechung </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorje </PERSON> <PERSON> Drakpa </PERSON>. Four Tibetan monks currently live at the Baca, planning the construction of retreat centers, a monastery, a holistic medical institute and a lay village for about 300 people. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Tibetan Project began nearly a decade ago, when followers of the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, refugees from the Chinese invasion of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1959, came to the <LOCATION> Baca </LOCATION> at Strong's invitation. She says they vowed to bring their most sacred texts and artifacts to the Baca, believing the Tibetan <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> tradition may perish in the Himalayas under <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> occupation. Ground will be broken this summer on the first three buildings of the project, estimated to cost nearly $ 1 million. Money is being raised through donations and pledges, Strong says. Altogether, only a couple of dozen people live permanently at the Baca's spiritual communities, visited by numerous retreatants. Strong herself is reluctant to publicize the Baca. `` It's not ready yet,'' she says. `` I do n't want this to be put on the map as a kooky place.'' But many of the spiritual groups depend on donations or retreatants' fees to pay their way. They want the world to know they are there. Two people live full-time at the 300-acre Zen Center, plus a couple of non-denominational retreatants at any given time and <PERSON> Roshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who heads the group and spends about half the week there. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> took over operation of the mountain retreat center from <LOCATION> Lindisfarne </LOCATION>, founded by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> writer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> to study religion and the humanities. With land donated by the <ORGANIZATION> Strongs </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> lived there until illness caused him to return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1983. Says <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Weischede </PERSON>, a West German native turned Zen monk and director of the <LOCATION> Crestone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> Zen Center: `` It's nice that people at the <LOCATION> Baca </LOCATION> are more open for some kind of spirituality. The decision to go into the desert more or less means you've decided to support each other.'' Once a week, the Baca's spiritual communities have a joint silent-prayer meeting, open to the larger community as well. `` The Baca's a place where all the great traditions can find nurture, not in isolation but in community,'' says <PERSON> Seyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Schochen </PERSON>, director of the Sri Aurobindo center, dedicated to the teachings of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aurobindo </LOCATION>, a Mahayogi of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> who died in 1950. `` It's unity through diversity.''

 <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> come off a faster, more international track than just about anyone in <LOCATION> Crestone </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON>'s early years sound like a Jack <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> story. Born in <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> in 1929, he ran away at 13, after graduating from high school five years early. He stowed away on a ship to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> where, at 17, he became an apprentice fur trader. He soon started his own mining company and his business interests proliferated. By age 23, he had made his first $ 1 million. Strong was the first head of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, from 1966-70, and the first head of <LOCATION> Petro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, from 1976-78. But he soon began augmenting his business expertise with environmental experience, and served as executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> environmental program, based in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, in the mid-1970s. In 1985, he was named executive coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' African emergency relief operations. An unusual mix of capitalist-developer and, as <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> called him in 1975, `` Custodian of the Planet,'' <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> says it is important to forge links between business and environmentalism. `` I believe you have to be in the middle of these things,'' he says. `` In our system, the market system, you affect the environment, and the only way to affect the environment positively is to make sure that you have environmental considerations built right into your business.'' When <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> first came to the <LOCATION> Baca </LOCATION> in 1978 after acquiring an interest in <ORGANIZATION> AZL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, which owned it, he says he knew he wanted to save it from routine development. `` We were attracted by the qualities that make it so special now _ the beauty, the space, the fact that it's not a ski resort,'' he says. Strong does want to develop the area's water, however, and he and a group of investors currently are embroiled in a heated dispute with valley water users over the investors' claim on what they say is a huge, untapped aquifer. Valley residents are skeptical of Strong's claim that the valley would benefit if his company sold the water to outside cities. <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON>'s interests stick closer to the Baca, and she says she and <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> complement each other. `` I'm the mystical one,'' she says. `` He's the manifester. He gets things done.'' She was born <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Marstrand </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, in 1941. Her father ran a fleet of salmon ships, and both her parents were active in the resistance to the Nazis, she says. Born a Lutheran but raised <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> says she had mystical experiences early on, including seeing angels. `` I knew from a very young age that I was n't Danish, that I was Indian,'' she says. `` And I knew that one day I would be with my people.'' After studying industrial and interior design in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, she moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in her early 20s and set up a design firm. In 1972, <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> left her business and moved to <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> where she had been hired to design the country's <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. There she met <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON>. The couple moved to <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, in 1972, where <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> became involved in Indian political issues. When she first came to the Baca, she says, `` I knew I was home.'' <PERSON> Hanne </PERSON> believes she and the <PERSON> Baca </PERSON> are creatures of both luck and destiny. `` I like luck _ I feel I've got a lot of it,'' she says. `` But far greater forces are at work and I know it will happen. It was meant to be. We're just tools, and we have to perfect ourselves.''

 Foreign trade could n't be much freer than in the Twin Saults, the two cities with the same name separated by the 2 -LCB- - mile breadth of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marys </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and flying different flags Americans and Canadians go back and forth across the border in droves to buy bread, have babies or drink beer, without a worry about tariffs or quotas. `` We call it jumping across the big ditch,'' says Canadian steel worker <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shurtliffe </PERSON>. On Wednesdays after work, <PERSON> Shurtliffe </PERSON> and his buddies hop the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marys </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> Ste. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, to the $ 1-a-beer bars in <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> Ste. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Canadian brew tastes better, but American suds are cheaper, <PERSON> Shurtliffe </PERSON> says Beer is n't the only bargain. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s dairy prices, for instance, are jacked up by a farm support system that is unlikely to change even under the country's free-trade agreements with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> No matter, <PERSON> Shurtliffe </PERSON> says. He buys American. Not only does he buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> milk for his grandchildren, he fills his pickup truck with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline and his refrigerator with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steaks. Even Canadian cigarettes are cheaper in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stores. `` It's an awful savings,'' <PERSON> Shurtliffe </PERSON> says. `` It seems everything's cheaper in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.'' It's a commerce without national loyalty. In the <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> -LRB- pronounce it soo -RRB-, many <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women have their American babies in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and tourists buy their Canadian souvenirs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The biggest traffic jams at <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> customs are at 2:30 a.m., when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bars close and Canadians go home. Customs agent <PERSON> Giacomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastore </PERSON> has seen the happy drivers line up for as long as 45-minute waits at the border crossing into <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` It's a ritual,'' <PERSON> Pastore </PERSON> says. `` It's an awful pile of Canadians,'' <PERSON> Shurtliffe </PERSON> says. Locals call them the Twin Saults or the Two Saults, but these cities on opposite sides of the Soo shipping locks are anything but identical. Historical markers on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side tell of the treaty taking northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> from the Chippewa Indians. A plaque on Canadian soil remembers the shameful `` Chicoro Incident'' of 1870, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused a <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> military ship passage through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> locks. The Canadians had to walk around the St. Marys rapids. <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION>, Ont., is six times the size of <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> town of 83,000 has a steel mill, paper mill and a large shopping mall. Its downtown Queen Street is dotted with upscale china shops. <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION>, Ont., also has more movie theaters, a lower drinking age and two strip clubs, says <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> teen-ager <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Newcomb </PERSON> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> is a quiet home to 14,500 people, many of whom do n't lock their doors. Summer tourism is the major industry. Winter snow is the biggest occurence. From a three-block drive of kitsch shops, visitors can buy blue wind chimes from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and T-shirts that say <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>? `` It's hard to buy a Canadian souvenir in their <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION>,'' explains <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, owner of a block of such tourist emporiums as Ships Ahoy, Captains Quarters and the Anchor and Seven Seas motels. `` This is where the tourists shop.'' Since the signing of the free-trade pact between the two countries, the easy commerce between the Saults has become even freer and easier. `` It seems to have opened up the gate,'' says <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor on the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> side. `` Trade has n't changed, but all of a sudden the Canadians have realized they can go shopping on our side Crossing the border is n't such an issue anymore.'' That's a problem. Law enforcement in <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, used to be a personal matter. You knew who was having a family fight and who was driving home from the bar. With so many people crossing over these days, the town is full of strangers. `` We do n't know who we're dealing with anymore,'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> says. Not all of the foreign trade is faring well. American insurance companies have put a crimp in the once-booming business of delivering babies in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. Ten years ago, as many as 20 percent of the women patients of an <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> obstetrician, Dr. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, were Americans drawn by the more-specialized services available in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. Now, with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and many insurance companies refusing to pay for health care outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, foreigners make up only 8 percent of <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>'s practice. Because the banks and bars, tourist centers and tollgates all set their own exchange rates, commerce between the Saults can get complicated. Those who cross frequently must master `` border math.'' <PERSON> Shurtliffe </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, for example, can figure which is cheaper: gasoline at 54 cents Canadian per liter or $ 1.21 American per gallon. That is considering also that her Canadian dollar currently buys only 80 cents <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and she has to pay $ 1.50 to drive across the International Bridge. It can get so confusing many businesses accept the other country's currency, even if it is n't legal tender. A Canadian dollar will buy as much beer at <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dear </PERSON>'s Back Door bar as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> greenback. `` After all, we are the Twin Saults,'' Dear says. More than half of his customers are Canadians. With the American dollar worth more at the moment, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents forgetting to exchange their money for Canadian suffer a double whammy. Not only do most Canadian businesses take <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency at the lower Canadian value, but Canadian prices often are higher. `` There is an advantage of having the right money on the right side at the right time,'' says <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> tourist from <LOCATION> Livonia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Putman </PERSON>, a farmer from <LOCATION> Williamston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, got caught in a <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> restaurant with hungry kids and only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cash in his wallet. He paid American and bought his food for 15 percent more than true cost. `` Of course, the waitress gave me my change in Canadian, so I was out there, too,'' <PERSON> Putman </PERSON> said. `` I got even. I tipped her in Canadian.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Since it was abandoned in the 15th century as the capital of a once-powerful <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> empire, Angkor has been ravaged by weather and vegetation, thieves and vandals. During the past 20 years of guerrilla fighting in the region, little has been done to restore its ancient edifices. Now help is on the way, from several corners of the world.

<DATELINE>ANGKOR, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the shadows of war receding from ancient Angkor, the international community is mobilizing to rescue from decay one of civilization's greatest artistic achievements. The Hindu and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> edifices, dating from the ninth through 12th centuries, have been assaulted by jungle growth, monsoon rains and thieves as armies clashed around them over the past two decades. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the only non-communist nation to recognize the pro-Hanoi government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, is already restoring the colossal Angkor Wat, the crowning jewel, but hundreds of other temples and architectural relics from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Golden Age remain untended. Security has been a major problem in recent years, with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and other anti-government guerrillas within striking distance of Angkor. And diplomatic isolation of the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government has prevented most international assistance. While the guerrillas remain a potential threat, there is optimism that a peaceful political solution may be reached following the promised withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in September. `` We are waiting for the first available opportunity to restore the magnificent monuments,'' says <PERSON> Mahfuz </PERSON> <PERSON> Anam </PERSON>, regional spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization. `` <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>'s director general is hopeful of a political solution.'' Although it is restricted from working with the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government, which the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> does not recognize, <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> this spring quietly dispatched two experts for a preliminary, on-site diagnosis of Angkor's ills. <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> may help organize an international symposium on Angkor and eventually launch a worldwide fund-raising campaign such as those which helped resurrect <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s pyramids, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Borobudur </LOCATION> temple and the ancient north African city of <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION> `` Everyone wants to get involved in Angkor,'' said one Western aid official in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. Ung Von, who heads <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s conservation effort here, says the Poles will arrive late this year to begin work on the <PERSON> Bayon </PERSON>, an intricate, 800-year-old shrine of mysterious galleries and 54 stone towers sculpted with the faces of smiling dieties. The wondrous structure is currently looked after by two old sweepers and guarded by two teen-age policemen. Its eastern gate caved in like a deck of cards several years ago. Green algae and white fungi mar its friezes of ancient battles and court life. The French, who hacked Angkor out of the jungle in the last century and became its most expert overseers, refuse to provide valuable archival material to <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> but have asked to restore the 11th-century Baphuon, Ung Von says. The Indians are midway through their six-year, $ 1O million project to renew Angkor Wat, a massive representation of the Hindu cosmos in stone which rises in three successive flights to five central towers that have become the symbol of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The work by 13 Indians and more than 400 Cambodians has included cleaning the friezes, dismantling and reassembling the gateways, and the excavation of ditches to allow drainage of water within the moat-girded complex. The work on Angkor Wat's nearly 1,440 square yards of friezes is painstaking. Brushes are used to scrub off moss, insect nests and clinging vegetation, the latter sometimes requiring injections of weed killer in a syringe. Other chemicals are used to attack fungi, micro-vegetable matter and corrosive bat droppings before a protective coating is applied. Heavy machinery is limited to the occasional use of a borrowed crane while obtaining construction supplies like cement is a logistical nightmare. Work proceeds with the use of hands, hoes and bamboo baskets, not unlike the way Angkor Wat was probably constructed. Some old, expert craftsmen who had worked with the French have returned but Ung Von says local expertise was decimated during the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule and by lack of training since. Some also criticize the Indians. `` They need our help,'' Ung Von says. `` Sometimes they do n't have the experience They have done their job well but their technique is different from the French.'' Some Cambodians and Westerners say privately that the Indian team uses inferior chemicals, is reassembling galleries in a way that allows water seepage, and is stubbornly clinging to some techniques abandoned by international leaders in conservation. But an expert, independent evaluation of their work has yet to be made and the Cambodians are publicly reluctant to criticize because they have made a major political issue of non-communist <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> coming to their aid. The Indian restoration, which began in 1987, was the first meaningful attempt to keep the rapid deterioration at bay since French archaeologist <PERSON> Bernard-Phillipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Groslier </PERSON> was expelled from Angkor by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in 1972. Angkor has fought against the elements since being abandoned in the 15th century as the capital of a once-powerful Cambodian empire. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> occupied the area during their war against the U.S.-backed government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> and did nothing to restore Angkor during their brutal time in power. Since 1979, the pro-Hanoi government has made efforts but with very few resources and expertise. Now, says Ung Von, there are prospects for real progress and small numbers of foreign tourists are starting to return. `` I feel like a sick man who is starting to feel well again,'' he says.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ `` The Prophet'' has guided several generations of high school and college students through the vicissitudes of growing up. Now a group of Lebanese-Americans would like to memorialize its author, their kinsman, <PERSON> Kahlil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON>. In a city that abounds with monuments that remind of war, they would make a quiet place, dedicated to peace.

 They're going to build a little garden here, across from the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> where the strident statue of <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, arm and fingers raised in a `` V,'' recalls memories of an awful war. The garden will celebrate peace and understanding, and a writer whose words helped four decades of American young people out of the maze of adolescence into the unsure world of adulthood. It is a garden that almost was n't. But Lebanese-Americans mobilized in the past few months to raise most of the $ 1 million or so needed to beat a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> deadline and break ground for the wooded two-acre plot dedicated to their countryman, <PERSON> Kahlil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON>, author of `` The Prophet.'' <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON>'s romantic dialectic was severely criticized by academics, but nevertheless captured the interest of generations of young people, notably in the 1960s, with passages like this: `` Then a woman said, Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow. `` And he answered: `` Your joy is your sorrow unmasked. `` And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.'' `` The Prophet,'' <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON>'s most popular book, is the best-selling hardcover book on the <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knopf </PERSON> list. It has racked up 6 million sales since it was first printed in 1923, and still sells 100,000 a year. The deluxe edition has sold another 363,000 copies at a steady rate of 11,500 a year, and the paperback has sold 1,886,000 at the rate of 40,000 a year. An audio version brought out in 1986 sells about 10,000 a year. But the plans for a memorial for <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON> were not nearly as successful, and it looked for a while as if the modest project might founder. It was the idea of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> housewife <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ameen </PERSON>, emanating from her despair over the plight of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, wracked by civil wars and invasion. She said she could n't stand `` the vision of all this bloodshed ... and I felt it was not the true image of the Lebanese,'' who for 4,000 years had been merchants and travelers, descendants of the ancient Phoenicians. In 1983, the 100th anniversary of <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON>'s birth, she determined to soften the image by building a memorial of some sort to the gentle writer whose words helped sustain the Rev. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON> in his captivity in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON> still quotes him: `` Not everyone in chains is subdued,'' and `` Hell is not torture. Hell is an empty heart.'' <PERSON> Ameen </PERSON>, who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Khalil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gibran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, had heard that the comedian <PERSON> Flip </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also quoted <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON> at his performances, and he appeared before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in behalf of the memorial. A resolution providing park service land for the <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON> garden was written by <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, now majority whip, and the late Rep. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> -LRB- Chick -RRB- <PERSON> Kazan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, both of Lebanese parentage. But the planning was easier than getting the funds. Finally, another Lebanese, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baroody </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Gerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, came to the rescue. He mobilized other prominent Arab-Americans and the money began trickling in. Through the summer a series of seven dinners from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> will raise almost half the needed $ 1 million with the rest coming from organizations, wealthy individuals and the general public. The deadline for breaking ground is October 19. `` It's off the ground and it's going to successfully conclude on target on time,'' <PERSON> Baroody </PERSON> says. `` It's been a struggle.'' One of the reasons, he says, is that most Lebanese in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> tended to assimilate totally, to become part of the background. But in the past 15 to 20 years they have tended to reconnect with their ethnic pride, partly in response to what was happening in their tiny native land. `` That's why I'm so excited about this project,'' <PERSON> Baroody </PERSON> says. `` With all of the tragedy around <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, the whole <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> situation, this has an incredibly uplifting potential.'' <PERSON> Ameen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baroody </PERSON> want the garden and the foundation to echo what they believe <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON> stood for: peace and understanding, mediation and consensus, rational debate and discussion. <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON> has plenty of critics in academic circles. They say his writing is not poetry, more like romantic drivel, an exercise in dialectics. What does <PERSON> Baroody </PERSON> think? `` Basically, I feel sorry for them.'' The garden in a lush woods near the vice president's residence and the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> will feature a pool and walkways where visitors can come to meditate. Among the new plantings will be three 25-foot Cedars of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, currently growing in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> nursery. <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON> lived most of his life in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In his last works, he wrote of an exile who returns to the garden of his fathers to meditate and says, `` We seek one another in our aloneness.''

 If you're 30 something you've probably never heard of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON>, but if you're under 30 you know he's the hottest `` hunk'' in the fall television season's coolest new show. <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON> set young hearts throbbing last year in <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 21 Jump Street'' as the handsome, brooding, rebel cop <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Booker </PERSON>. In September, <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON> will be spun off into `` Booker,'' which <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> advertising agency, forecasts as the only hit of the television season. That the show is on the so-called fourth network speaks to <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON>'s appeal and to the changing face of television. `` <PERSON> Booker </PERSON>'s rebellious in the sense that he does n't do things by the book,'' <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON> says. `` He's unorthodox, but he's honest. They brought me onto ` 21 Jump Street' to be an antagonist, then get killed off after six shows. I guess the audience liked my character and they decided to keep me on. `` We'll get more into his private life on the new show. We know he has a mother, but they did n't get along. He's a loner. He did n't even have a girlfriend They brought someone on but it did n't last long.'' In the final episode of `` 21 Jump Street'' in the past season, <PERSON> Booker </PERSON> arrested <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Depp </PERSON>, on a charge of murder. The story picks up in the first episode of `` 21 Jump Street'' in September. `` I get <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> out on a 48-hour pass and we retrace the steps of what happened,'' <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON> says. `` What happens is I uncover a lot of corruption in the city government. I offend a lot of people in high places and have to leave the police force and become a private detective.'' `` Booker'' takes over the Sunday night time slot of `` 21 Jump Street'' _ which jumps to Monday to open a new night of programming for <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON>'s longish black hair is combed up and back and falls loosely over his face. He is dark, with dark eyes and a wide mouth that curls up into a half-smile. He's Italian on his father's side and Irish on his mother's. He's wearing jeans, a black T-shirt with sunglasses stuck into the neck and a leather wrist bracelet with big, silvery studs. He's bigger than he appears on screen. He's 6 feet tall, muscular, but down to 165 pounds compared to the 220 he weighed when he played college football. He collects vintage motorcycles. In the new show, <PERSON> Booker </PERSON> goes to work for a large company called the <ORGANIZATION> Yamada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Booker </PERSON> will occasionally ride a motorcycle as a symbol of freedom `` He's a fish out of water,'' explains <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON>. `` He's surrounded by all these corporate types. They're not used to people like me. My uniform is basically what I'm wearing now, a T-shirt and jeans. They're into suits and ties. He tries to get along with the people but he does n't conform. I'm basically the house detective, but I'll also take cases from the outside So, it's the hip side of ` 21 Jump Street' with the background of ` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.''' <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, just south of the Canadian border, where he played hockey, lacrosse and football. His father also collects motorcycles, including a 1941 Indian Scout and a 1939 three-wheeler. <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON> has a 1954 Harley-Davidson that he keeps in <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>. He went to <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> on a football scholarship and majored in political science. At first, he thought he was going to become a lawyer but started acting in college. <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON> left school after three semesters and four knee operations due to football injuries. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> he was a model but soon began to study acting. He joined the soap opera `` One Life To Live'' as <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardener </PERSON>, a character he jokingly referred to as `` a rebel ski bum.'' While he was on the show he got more mail than anyone else. `` I remember my first day on the set,'' he says. `` I'd been on stage but never in front of a camera before. I was so nervous I could n't speak. The producer kept calling the sound booth and saying, ` He's not breathing.''' Two years ago he moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and landed roles on `` Rags to Riches,'' `` Who's the Boss'' and `` The Bronx Zoo.'' He auditioned for `` 21 Jump Street'' with about 100 other actors. He was called back five times before he got the role. Then he had little time before he had to fly to <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` Booker'' also will be filmed in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLuise </PERSON> and other stars of `` Jump Street'' will occasionally pay a visit to the new show.

 Consider the chances of success for a play called `` Other People's Money.'' The author's last work folded on opening night. The leading man left to make a film before rehearsals started. His replacement backed out the day rehearsals were supposed to begin. The third choice, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, was not exactly a box-office name. The director, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzio </PERSON>, was even less well known. And the Wall Street crash of October 1987 made the subject matter _ the takeover of a small company by a ruthless tycoon _ seem out-of-date to many experienced theater people. None of the above stopped neophyte producers <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallin </PERSON> from opening `` Other People's Money'' last February at the Minetta Lane Theater. In six months, the play by <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterner </PERSON> has slowly become one of off-Broadway's biggest hits, with the sold-out sign now going up for almost every performance. `` The favorable word-of-mouth has really done it for us,'' says <PERSON> Gallin </PERSON>, whose only other producing effort in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was `` Burn This'' by <PERSON> Lanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> two years ago. Such diverse theatergoers as theater critic <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and business tycoons <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ichan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> saw the play twice _ have praised `` Other People's Money.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> even offered to move the play to <ORGANIZATION> Broadway </ORGANIZATION>, a proposal declined by Ash and <PERSON> Gallin </PERSON>. `` I think a successful play on Broadway today has to almost approach being a musical,'' Ash says. `` It has to have either a star or something out of the ordinary. Broadway has come to be a place only for muscials and extravaganzas, and off-Broadway has become a place to do good plays, like ` Driving Miss Daisy,' ` The Cocktail Hour' or ` Other People's Money.''' Producing a play off-Broadway also is different from producing on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. Because the theaters are smaller, so are the profit margins. The line between a profitable and an unprofitable week can be narrow. Most new off-Broadway shows need time to build audiences. Ash and <PERSON> Gallin </PERSON> figured they would lose money during the early weeks of the run, the time needed for favorable audience reaction to pay off. Their general manager told them to expect 12 weeks of losses. They budgeted the show at $ 525,000, including a reserve fund of $ 120,000 raised to pay for a heavy advertising campaign. `` I had seen too many mornings when the producers have to scurry to try and raise money to run an ad or a television spot,'' Ash says. `` And then they wind up giving away all their producers' points, selling their soul to get that money It's terrible.'' Ash knows something about selling shows. Although `` Other People's Money'' is his first producing effort, he has been in theatrical advertising for more than 20 years. Now director of theatrical accounts for <ORGANIZATION> Grey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ash </PERSON> was a pioneer in developing live-action television ads for Broadway plays and musicals. Ash worked on the advertising for <PERSON> Sterner </PERSON>'s last venture, the short-lived `` Be Happy for Me.'' Despite its quick departure, they became friends. Sterner knew that Ash wanted to produce and brought him a copy of `` Other People's Money,'' his second play in early 1987. `` I read it and fell quite in love with it,'' Ash recalls. The story concerns a barracuda-like corporate raider who wants to take over a family-owned business that is the lifeblood of a small <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> town. The company hires an attractive female attorney to battle the takeover artist, and their fights turn from the financial to the sexual. The play had some readings on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and with actor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorvino </PERSON>, who was interested in playing the lead. He did n't, but the play was done at his <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Teaneck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>,. in the spring of 1987. Audience reaction was favorable, and <PERSON> Ash </PERSON> had lined up an investor to put up half the amount needed to bring the play to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Then the stock market crashed in October and the money evaporated. <PERSON> Gallin </PERSON> then entered the picture. She became interested in the play after a good friend, <PERSON> Davina </PERSON> <PERSON> Belling </PERSON>, went after the movie rights. `` I read a lot of plays, and this one left me with something to think about,'' <PERSON> Gallin </PERSON> says. `` And it was very entertaining. I even gave it to people who were n't in the theater to read and I got a wonderful reaction.'' Ash and <PERSON> Gallin </PERSON> decided to produce the play together off-Broadway and went looking for a director. The two producers sought suggestions from their friends in the theater business. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>, artistic director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, was on the top of everybody's list. <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> had other commitments, but a play reader at his theater recommended it. <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> finally read `` Other People's Money'' and loved it. The play, directed by <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzio </PERSON>, was done at the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stage </LOCATION> as part of its 1988-89 season. `` That was a wonderful experience,'' <PERSON> Gallin </PERSON> says. `` It was good for the play and for <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, who was able to do some rewriting, and for <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON>, our director, who had time to polish the production.'' It was the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> production, with <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> as a last-minute replacement as the new leading man, that made it to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The show opened with a miniscule advance and a favorable but not overwhelming review in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which did n't deter the two producers. `` We did a radio campaign, sponsoring business reports on all-news radio stations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, advertised in the Wall Street Journal and sent letters to the CEOs of many corporations and invited them to come,'' Ash says. Now the stretch limos are regular fixtures in front of the Minetta Lane Theater, as well as more ordinary theatergoers drawn by the favorable word-of-mouth. Ash and <PERSON> Gallin </PERSON> are now contemplating a national tour for the play, probably with a star, and also a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> production. `` It's a play that stays with people somehow,'' Ash says. `` They keep talking about it for days afterward. And even two years after the big stock market crash, it's relevant. You pick up the newspaper and you see this thing about <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and Time magazine and Paramount. The subject is still current.''

 `` Mississippi Burning'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. VHS-Beta, $ 79.98. Rated R -RRB- In the summer of 1964, young men and women from around the nation poured into <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to take part in `` Freedom Summer,'' a concerted effort to register black voters in the segregated state. One was 20-year-old <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. On June 21, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and two members of CORE -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, drove to the town of <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION> where a black church had been burned. They never returned. They were stopped for speeding near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and jailed for several hours on bogus charges. After being released that night, the workers failed to call in. After an extensive search, involving the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and 200 sailors, and a tip from a `` Mr. X,'' the bodies were discovered Aug. 4 on a farm outside of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. A fictionalized account of the murder of those three young volunteers is unraveled in <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s `` Mississippi Burning.'' The movie is by no means an accurate or riveting account of that strange and horrendous period in American history. Rather, it is a detective story that boils down to the typical Hollywood good cop-bad cop treatment. It is male bonding redux. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> focuses on two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents sent to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to investigate the disappearance of the civil rights workers. Ward -LRB- <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> -RRB- is the upstanding, neatly suited partner who plays things by the book. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON> -RRB- is a redneck and a maverick. He does things his way and has a short fuse. Their search, and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s seething tensions are relentless. Through plot twists that suspend disbelief, they discover the bodies and peel away the facade of white Southern virtue, exposing it as an ugly, oozing canker sore. In the meantime, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> almost has his audience cheering for the wonderful <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. But the reality is that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was more a harassment to blacks and sympathetic whites during the civil rights struggle than heroic knight. The movie also overlooks those who were at the very helm of the movement and who led and suffered through that summer. Blacks are mere pimples on the landscape in <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s thinking; they stand by and do nothing. They have no passions, no aggressions, no thoughts. The strength of `` Mississippi Burning'' is not its shallow look at segregation, but its performances, especially by <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON>. His portrayal of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is one of the best in his career. He steamrolls through the movie with volcanic force, filling the theater with a crackling tension and good ole boy charm. <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> is, by necessity, the antithesis, and he delivers well. Taken as a detective film, `` Mississippi Burning'' -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> file name for the case -RRB-, is a fine piece of entertainment, and works well on the home screen. But do n't expect a credible history lesson. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` Witchery'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Vidmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>. VHS, $ 79.95. No rating. -RRB- `` Witchery'' is a simply terrible film with absolutely no redeeming virtues. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, who first horrified audiences as the possessed youngster in `` The Exorcist,'' and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasselhoff </PERSON> -LRB- TV's `` Night Rider'' -RRB- fail to save this piece of junk. Their lackluster acting, coupled with an impossibly bad script, should cause this video to gather dust on the store shelf. There is graphic violence and <PERSON> gore </PERSON>, including garroting, crucifixion, rape and other bits of murderous mayhem. But the story is so incredibly weak that even these excesses ca n't boost it to any interesting level. It has the look and feel of a made-for-TV movie, and is as dull as the worst sitcom. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> plays an investigator of paranormal phenomena. She's appears half asleep most of the time, mumbling her way through her lines <PERSON> Hasselhoff </PERSON>, a photographer and <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>'s fiance, tries to make the best of it with dialogue about as snappy as a grapefruit commercial. The two have come to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> island to take pictures of an old hotel that resembles a witch during certain times of the day. As the witch, <PERSON> Hildegard </PERSON> <PERSON> Knef </PERSON> is about the best thing going in the movie. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manches </PERSON> plays the most credible role as <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>, a child who communicates with the witch. _ By <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Twins'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Home Video. VHS-Beta, $ 89.95. Rated PG -RRB- Not since <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> has such a physically contrasting comedy team come along: <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>. `` Twins'' is simply wonderful entertainment. It's silly, improbable, irreverent. <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON> and <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> play twin brothers who were separated at birth. No joke. Seems mom was this `` exceptional'' woman who gave her body to a secret biological experiment in creating a superman. Something went wrong, the egg split and a runt turned up as well. As they reunite, search for their mom, dodge a hitman, uncover the truth of their origins and otherwise scheme and hustle their way through the movie, the duo provide enough laughs to fill a Sunday afternoon family viewing. <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> continues to impress with good comedic work, both in direction and acting. <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON>, usually a heavy -LRB- in more ways than one -RRB-, is a giggle in a lighter mood. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reitman </PERSON> directed `` Twins.'' _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` ` Batman' Soundtrack'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Prince Leave it to <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> to score a No. 1 record at precisely the time his record company wanted him out of the stores. With sagging record sales due, at least in part, to overexposure, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> wanted <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> on the shelf for awhile. But <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> foiled those plans by dashing off a soundtrack to `` Batman'' in a matter of days after being inspired by the movie. Though `` Batman'' has turned virtually everything it touches to gold, the single `` Batdance'' still qualifies as one of the strangest hit songs in years. It's not even a song, really, just a six-minute collage of dialogue from the film with a jarring tempo change in the middle. In other words, it manages to break just about every rule and still be compelling. It does n't hurt that it contains one of Prince's best guitar solos in years. The hurried nature of this project is apparent throughout the rest of the soundtrack _ to both good and bad effect. Prince seems liberated by the need to work in a hurry. It forces discipline and leaves no room for the musical conceits that cloud some of his recent work. In retrospect, it often seems the more time he has to work on a song, the further he strays from the original idea. The music is simple and straightforward, by nature some of <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>'s most commercial work. Songs such as `` Partyman,'' `` <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> Waiting'' and `` Electric Chair'' prove Prince can write serviceable funk in his sleep. The downside is the appearance of the first Prince work that can rightfully be called hackneyed. The ballad `` Scandalous'' and the <PERSON> Sheena </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> duet `` The Arms of Orion'' are excruciating. There is n't a memorable lyric on the album, and no innovations to make you shake your head in surprise. But it's tough to argue with a No. 1 record. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> did n't have to dance with the devil in the pale moonlight for this hit. Maybe just the Joker.

 You've got to take <ORGANIZATION> Yahoo </ORGANIZATION> seriously, after he has written, directed, produced and starred in a movie being released by a major film company. First of all, about his name. `` It's on my passport; it's been like that since I was at art school: <ORGANIZATION> Yahoo </ORGANIZATION> Serious,'' explains the 35-year-old Australian virtuoso who stars in `` Young <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>.'' `` I changed it to have an art work of a name but also make it a laugh. It kind of fit in with the rest of the stuff I did _ the weird hair, and weirder clothes and stuff. I had this really ordinary name -LRB- <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Pead </PERSON> -RRB- and I thought, ` I can do better than this.' `` ` <ORGANIZATION> Yahoo </ORGANIZATION>' is almost impossible to say unless you're having a good time. ` Serious,' I guess, is the director's side of me. I dunno. It's kind of a parody on names, I suppose.'' The other remarkable thing about Serious is the hair. It's a brown mass that rises from his head like a bramble <PERSON> bush </PERSON>. He calls it `` an Australian surfing haircut'' and claims it's the reason he chose to portray <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> _ `` he's the only historical character with the same haircut.'' Serious came here for his first exposure to the American media. He may well be the biggest Australian import since <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>. His film, `` <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>,'' has broken records of `` Rambo,'' `` Star Wars'' and the like in his home country. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> is hoping, not without some nervousness, that Serious will catch on here. It's hard to describe `` Young <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>.'' You might call it a combination of rock music, silent-screen slapstick and bogus history. <ORGANIZATION> Yahoo </ORGANIZATION> plays <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> at the age of 26, when he discovered both relativity and rock' n' roll. All this happens in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, you see. The inspiration for `` Young <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>'' came during a trip down the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. He relates it with such sincerity that you want to believe him. `` I crossed the Andes with a mate, and we ended up on the border of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and I think <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. We were going to take a boat down the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>. I do n't think they had Australians aboard before because we drank them out of beer in two days. `` We put in at a little village. The Brazilian native who was carrying the beer on board wore a T-shirt with a picture of <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> sticking his tongue out. Where he got the T-shirt in the middle of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle, I do n't know. That was the inspiration: The greatest mind of the 20th Century doing something so irreverent and childlike at the age of 72. I thought, wow, we've got the basis for a film here. Serious had dabbled in film before, making documentaries that somehow came out as comedies. How to sell a feature? He decided to do it by degrees. He sold his car, bought some film, borrowed a camera, gathered a cast and crew and began shooting. When he ran out of money, he borrowed an editing machine, put together what he had filmed and sought financing. Amazingly, he found backing from some investors, the <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, an Australian distributor _ and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros </ORGANIZATION>. He was able to finish `` <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>'' the way he wanted, `` with a cast of thousands and a huge musical score and eight rock songs.'' He was born in the <LOCATION> Hunter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. He quit school to work as a tire fitter so he could afford to attend art school. It became apparent early on that he had to express himself not with brush and paint, but with the magic of comedy. `` I was fed by two of the major cultures, besides having the indigenous, sardonic, self-effacing Australian humor,'' he recalled. `` The <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON> influence came on TV from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. At the same time there were all the wonderful'60s situation comedies from here, like ` Green Acres,' ` The Addams Family,' ` Get Smart' and all the others. Bugs Bunny was also a huge influence. `` At the same time, I loved epic films, especially <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lean </PERSON>'s. ` Lawrence of Arabia' was a huge influence on me. I loved the idea of putting comedy in a film of epic proportions. I had no idea it was going to be a big hit, that's all.'' <ORGANIZATION> Yahoo </ORGANIZATION> Serious is already a notable in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and he'll certainly be the same here, with his electrocuted hair and his uniform of flowery Hawaiian shirt and floppy white shorts The recognition does n't bother him: `` I usually get ` G'dy, <ORGANIZATION> Yahoo </ORGANIZATION>,' ` G'dy, <ORGANIZATION> Yahoo </ORGANIZATION>,' that sort of stuff. Like I say, the word <ORGANIZATION> Yahoo </ORGANIZATION> makes people feel good.'' Can we expect `` Young <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> II''? `` Sequels are good when they are a small part of what is being made,'' he said. `` When they're the bulk of what's being made, I think it's self-defeating. Maybe when I'm a grey-haired old guy and we've forgotten about sequels, maybe we'll see ` <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> Goes to <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>' or something like that. But there wo n't be a sequel in the foreseeable future.''

 It's easy to pick out <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissman </PERSON> in a crowd of pianists: She's the one who's known for playing <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginastera </PERSON>. `` What a joy to find composers in this century one can be passionate about!'' she says. `` Prokofiev is a 20th-century modern continuing the Romantic tradition. I believe the music cries out to be played that way.'' <PERSON> Nissman </PERSON>, whose parents were born in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, studied Russian language and literature at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, as well as music. <PERSON> Ginastera </PERSON> visited the campus in the late 1960s when she was rehearsing his piano concerto and liked the way she played it. They kept in touch and, during the 15 years she pursued her career in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, she often played his music. The composer dedicated his `` Third Piano Sonata'' to her. `` I play all three. They're wonderful. I think the first is his masterpiece. My favorite of his works is ` Argentine Dances,' which he wrote for solo piano when he was 18,'' <PERSON> Nissman </PERSON> said. `` His widow, who's a cellist, and I are going to record the cello concerto he wrote for her. It never has been recorded. I think he would have been pleased.'' <PERSON> Nissman </PERSON> recorded all nine Prokofiev piano sonatas for Newport Classic, distributed on cassettes and compact discs by <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>. Volume 2 was released in July with Volume 3 set for August. Last season she played all nine sonatas in three concerts at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, the first time that has been done in one season. She repeated it at <ORGANIZATION> Wigmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Next season she'll do the cycle in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities. `` There are plans for me to do the cycle in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> _ an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> of Russian origin going to play Russian music for Russians,'' said <PERSON> Nissman </PERSON>, who has been invited by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to go through <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON>'s piano sketches. `` They've done it with his symphonies, operas and ballets. Maybe I can find some manuscripts that have n't been discovered.'' Asked in a recent interview what led her to play the Prokofiev cycle, she said, `` Just following my nose, exploring music that is not often played in concert. I had played several of the sonatas with the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION>. I decided to look at the ones I did n't know. I was n't disappointed at all. `` I also found a fragment of a 10th sonata and a second version of the fifth,'' she said. `` I had the first page of the fragment and wrote the archives in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to see if there was a second page. It arrived an hour before the premiere was to be given and I sight-read it at the concert. `` It transformed my conception of the first page. He went in a completely different direction. It was very exciting to have that, to realize that at the end of his life he was going back to the lyrical style of the ninth sonata.'' That fragment of the 10th sonata was the last thing <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON> wrote before he died in 1953. `` It ends in the middle of a measure. He had a fall, but kept on writing on his deathbed.'' <PERSON> Nissman </PERSON> will make a Liszt recording this fall. `` I ca n't give up <PERSON> Liszt </PERSON>. He's one of my favorites,'' she says. `` They come from the same tradition. They all really knew and respected the piano and delighted in virtuosity, which is very appealing to the public and to a pianist. `` Prokofiev built on tradition with his own personality. That's the essence of what modern means _ being his own man yet building upon a foundation, using those elements to make it his own and have something personal to say `` People came to the recitals resisting <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON>,'' she said. `` The preconception is dissonance, that the music should be played without emotion, with a hard, dry, brittle sound. They were amazed at the lyricism and emotional content and what they felt when they were listening to the music. `` There is so much there. In his simplicity, <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON> is truly profound. I would say the essence of his music is the wonderful simplicity. He communicates directly. That's what one wants from any composer, to touch the soul.'' <PERSON> Nissman </PERSON> recalled that when she was a child and heard `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>,'' she was delighted with the melodies. `` And his piano music abounds with wonderful melodies. The fifth sonata is the weakest because of the lack of melody,'' she said. `` But the weakest for <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON> is still pretty darn good.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Eclectic English Band Finds Mainstream Acceptance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In a summer dominated by `` classic rock'' radio, and concerts by reformed 1970s supergroups, Love and <ORGANIZATION> Rockets </ORGANIZATION> has managed to take its intriguing mix of dreamy mood music and jackhammer metal into the Top 20. While the members of the British trio express no love for oldies stations or the ubiquitous reunion tours, do n't count them among the bands complaining that a newer band ca n't make it in 1989. The band, currently on tour in support of its fourth album, `` Love and Rockets,'' has found a good outlet for its music on college radio. And concert crowds, which include fans of Love and <ORGANIZATION> Rockets </ORGANIZATION>' predecessor, the early'80s group Bauhaus, have been growing on the strength of the band's first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hit single, `` So Alive.'' `` We're over the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, we are,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ash </PERSON> of the band's current success Ash plays bass, guitar, and saxophone and sings about half the band's songs. Rounding out Love and Rockets are the brother team of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> on guitar, bass, harmonica and vocals, and drummer <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> said each of the band's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tours has found audiences bigger and more knowledgeable of the group's work. `` The familiarity grows every time we come back. The songs are more recognizable to a greater part of the audience,'' he said. `` This is the most definitive record we've done so far. That's why we called it simply ` Love and Rockets.''' Defining the group's sound is an elusive task, as Love and Rockets works in a musical universe that has room for the latter-day psychedelia of `` The Teardrop Collector,'' as well as the noise explosion of `` No Big Deal.'' It's almost an axiom that the rise in popularity of `` classic rock'' radio, with its emphasis on'70s - style hard rock, has made it difficult for less established groups to get airplay or That phenomenon has been accompanied this summer by reunion tours by such veteran acts as The Who, the <ORGANIZATION> Doobie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Allman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Ash </PERSON> said that despite the attention to older rock music, in some ways the band has had better access to the airwaves here than back home in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Being heard on college radio has paved the way to increased mainstream acceptance, he said. `` I think the college radio situation in the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> is excellent; it's a great idea,'' <PERSON> Ash </PERSON> said. `` With the college stations in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, they love playing their music and there is n't any commercial consideration They play what they actually like.'' The ideal radio station, <PERSON> Ash </PERSON> said, would play new records and also some good old music. `` Why not play something that was recorded in 1964, and then something that was recorded last Tuesday?'' he said. <PERSON> Ash </PERSON> said he felt strongly that rock' n' roll groups have a limited life span. He said he was opposed to the current wave of tours by veteran rockers. `` The Who should n't exist. It's stupid,'' <PERSON> Ash </PERSON> said. `` It's like a contradiction of what they were originally about. It's nonsense, it's a rip-off. `` They're too old to do that sort of music. When you sing songs like ` My Generation' and see guys in their mid-40s ... it's hilarious, it's wrong,'' <PERSON> Ash </PERSON> said `` When you're involved in something like contemporary music, it's real important to realize when you look ridiculous.'' He said Love and <ORGANIZATION> Rockets </ORGANIZATION> is just now hitting its prime. `` We just work on whatever feels right at the time,'' he said. `` We've grown close as a group. We can be open enough to know when somebody's doing something wrong.'' With its popularity growing, the band is recording some of its current tour dates for a possible live album. Also in the works is a home video compilation and mini-album of songs recorded around the time of `` Love and Rockets'' but which did not fit in with the sound of that album. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> described the mini-album as `` a cross between the Andrews Sisters, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and Captain <PERSON> Beefheart </PERSON>.''

 <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopate </PERSON> prefers sitting behind a typewriter to standing atop a soapbox. He distrusts movements, getting caught up in any event larger than himself. A man of caution, he remembers with discomfort the 1960s group ritual of passing a body from one set of arms to another. What he does trust is the individual voice, expressed in writing through the personal essay. `` I think it's important because it's a direct conversation between the writer and the reader, and has the flavor of personality,'' said <PERSON> Lopate </PERSON>, author of `` Against Joie de Vivre'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Poseidon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, $ 18.95 -RRB-, a collection of personal essays. `` If you believe in individuals and individual voices, then it's one of the ways of getting a sense of dialogue going A personal essay gives you a model of a human being in all his hesitations and faults and confusions.'' His tales are more of observation than experience. <PERSON> Lopate </PERSON> examines the myth of <PERSON> Samson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Delilah </PERSON>, deconstructs the manners of dinner parties and, in the title essay, attacks mindless optimism. `` I think I have a streak of detachmant which is very suitable for being a writer and maybe not so suitable for other activities. It's very hard to knock me off course. I'm always watching in some way, some part of me refuses to be swept away,'' he said in an interview. `` When I write, I'm able to get a sense of perspective. So that experiences which are too painful for someone else to contemplate, I can think about with a certain humor, a certain wryness and begin to shape them.'' He is, admittedly, a believer in committing experiences to memory as they occur, even at the risk of reducing their emotional impact. Detachment is vital, he insists, a way of examining an issue to its fullest and working through to a well-considered conclusion. `` I tend to analyze and brood over what has happened to me until I make little stories,'' <PERSON> Lopate </PERSON> said. `` My essays have a strong story-telling impulse. Sometimes, they're really on the borderline between fiction and nonfiction; they're shaped in the narrative way. They're about characters, people as characters.'' <PERSON> Lopate </PERSON>, who worked as a writer-in-residence at a public school in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, uses this approach in `` Suicide of a Schoolteacher,'' examining the feelings brought on when a colleague takes his own life. `` When I write about something traumatic, I'm trying to overcome the pain and put it behind me,'' he said. `` Then I think I do n't have to write about it anymore, I've dealt with it But I also write to hold onto things that would otherwise be lost. It's a salvaging process.'' <PERSON> Lopate </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the early'60s, acquiring a passion for films that never subsided. He is currently on the selection committee of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> and credits movies with helping develop his skills at narration. `` Sometimes you learn an art by studying another art. I learned the grammar of film and it helped me to write. There's a great deal of cinematic influence in my writing. A lot of times, the scene will unroll as I'm experiencing it.'' In `` Chekhov for Children,'' <PERSON> Lopate </PERSON> describes the sometimes tortuous process of directing a dozen adolescents in the Russian playwright's bleak `` Uncle Vanya.'' He knows that detachment does n't work with children or the theater, and writes of the emotional highs and lows experienced during rehearsals. `` Children are always surprising,'' he said. `` I watch them and find them very dramatic. They do n't tone down their response so much. They'll tell you they hate you or love you; they do n't disguise very much `` That can be invigorating, and it can also be humiliating. If a kid does n't like you, it's more of a setback than if an adult does n't like you, because you feel they're responding very naturally.'' `` Against Joie de Vivre'' is <PERSON> Lopate </PERSON>'s seventh book. He has also published a previous collection of essays and an account of his public school experience, `` Being With Children,'' two volumes of poetry and two novels, including the well-received `` The Rug Merchant'' in 1987. <PERSON> Lopate </PERSON> views the world as a stage and himself a dispassionate critic, interpreting the actors' performances to the audience at large. `` Some writers are fascinated with language; I want to write beautifully and eloquently, but much more important is for me to capture character on the page _ starting with my own character and using that to spread outward, to use myself as a messenger that will bring back the world.'' He sees himself as fighting to maintain integrity in a world where people hide their real feelings. For <PERSON> Lopate </PERSON>, the personal essay is a written form of protest, a modern equivalent of burning his draft card. `` There's something almost subversive about the personal essay,'' he said. `` It empowers the individual. I also think that in a time when many writers are afraid to say explicitly what they think, as in fiction when they show but they do n't tell too much, the essay becomes a place where the writer testifies without a disguise of what she or he knows.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Bobby Vinton Still Singing About Love And Loneliness</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinton </PERSON>, still singing about love and loneliness 27 years after his first hit record, believes the title of his current album reflects his music: `` Timeless.'' <PERSON> Vinton </PERSON>, a trim and youthful looking 54, continues to turn out romantic ballads reminiscent of `` Roses Are Red'' _ his 1962 breakthrough song on the national record charts. The first single release from `` Timeless'' is `` Please Tell Her That I Said Hello,'' which is about a man crying over an old lover. Other selections on the album include such love songs as `` Getting Used to Being Loved Again,'' and `` I Made Love -LRB- With You Tonight -RRB-.'' `` I feel my music is timeless,'' <PERSON> Vinton </PERSON>, nicknamed `` the Polish prince,'' said in an interview. `` ` Roses Are Red' and ` Blue Velvet' still sound good today, and you can relate to them There will always be that type of music. There will always be a love singer, a singer of stories and simplicity.'' He's been flirting with a country, downhome feel to his music for the past few years. He uses fiddles and steel guitars on `` Timeless'' and is trying to get country music radio stations interested in his music so that he can be heard on the same outlets that feature <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Strait </PERSON>. `` I could be the beginning of the next dimension in country music,'' <PERSON> Vinton </PERSON> said. `` The country music DJs today are the old pop DJs of the'60s. We've all made the changes together. `` Country music is expanding. Radio stations are finding that if you play a <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinton </PERSON> type of artist, you can pick up listeners from adult contemporary stations who are getting too rock' n' rollish `` Country music is becoming the pop music of the'60s,'' he said. `` And that's where I came from. Country music is more than guys in a bar or guys in a corral. It's really growing.'' <PERSON> Vinton </PERSON> has sold 50 million records since `` Roses Are Red.'' His other hit records, mostly in the mid-1960s, include `` Blue Velvet,'' `` There I've Said It Again,'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Lonely </PERSON>,'' `` Blue on Blue,'' `` I Love How You Love Me,'' `` Sealed With a Kiss,'' `` Everyday of My Life'' and finally, in 1974, `` My Melody of Love.'' His memories of three of his biggest hits: _ `` Roses Are Red'': `` came out around graduation time and it was a great farewell song.'' _ `` Blue Velvet'': `` was recorded with 10 minutes left on the recording session. I did n't pick it and did n't like it.'' _ `` Mr. Lonely'': `` related to lonely people. There's loneliness in all of us and I felt it; I dug back in my soul for this and people felt the loneliness.'' He said he did well with love songs because he believed in their message and their emotion. `` I really feel them. I do n't feel rock' n' roll. You feel what you have inside and I have a lot of this. You ca n't fake it. I had an honesty about the records.'' He did as well in his own romantic life as he did singing about it. He's been married to his wife, his only one, for 27 years. His `` There I've Said It Again'' in 1964 holds the distinction in pop music of being the last No. 1 record before the Beatles led the `` British invasion'' of English bands who changed the sound of rock' n' roll music. <PERSON> Vinton </PERSON> was able to maintain a career, but many of his peers were never as popular again. `` They eliminated my competition,'' <PERSON> Vinton </PERSON> said about the effect the Beatles had on male vocalists of his style. A whole new generation of record buyers is alive now and <PERSON> Vinton </PERSON> is still competing for their dollars. `` I lasted because I made the right songs _ good, honest, emotional records. I do shows and give them a show they ca n't resist So they come back year after year and see me. I've changed my show to make it fresh, make it different. `` My music is part of a lot of their lives,'' he said. `` It brings back memories: their youth, their first date, their marriage. So they want to go out and enjoy their early life and growing up and all of that.'' He feels that he's a much better performer than he was 20 years ago. `` I was awful then. I was young, inexperienced, nervous and I was n't the confident performer I am today. Luckily, I was able to stick around to the point where I can walk on stage today and have control of the audience. `` Being an entertainer is like being a surgeon,'' said <PERSON> Vinton </PERSON>. `` The longer you do it, the better you get at it.''

<HEAD>Golden Years Dimmed by Abuse for Many Elderly</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> did n't dare wait for the elevator. She ran down six flights of stairs, her 69 years weighing heavy _ less for the age and a bad hip, more for her 52-year-old son who was waving a knife and threatening to kill her. Out on the street <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> headed for a neighbor's phone to tell the police her son had turned abusive again. `` You work and support a child all your life,'' she said from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where she lives. `` Then they act like they hate you.'' <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> -LRB- not her real name -RRB- is n't alone. As many as 2 million elderly people may be abused, researchers say, often by children, grandchildren, even great-grandchildren _ the very people they depend on for care in their old age. `` This happens with these blood relatives _ sons, daughters, nieces, nephews,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodie </PERSON>, a 75-year-old retired social worker who works with the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> Elder Abuse Support Projsaid <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>, District Attorney of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, where elder abuse has risen 400 percent since 1986 to 370 cases last year. She attributes the increase to abusers' use of crack cocaine. Last year, 140,000 cases of elder abuse were reported nationwide, an increase of 10 percent from 1987, said <PERSON> Toshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatara </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Elder Abuse in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` People still find it incredible that we abuse our elders. They said the same thing about children 20 years ago. And we're doing it like a national pastime.'' <PERSON> Tatara </PERSON> believes just one in 14 cases is likely to be reported. The victim usually is 75 or older, a woman and generally dependent, the abuser a son or daughter, the congressional report found. Lawmakers heard about a 68-year-old <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> woman whose daughter kept her in a room so cold the urine in a catheter froze; a 75-year-old retired nurse from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> whose 42-year-old son attacked him with a hatchet; a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> woman whose $ 167,000 estate was whittled to $ 3,000 by a son-in-law. `` These cases are really difficult and scary even to experienced social workers,'' said <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Victim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which helped <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> seek a temporary restraining order against her son. `` I was really afraid of him,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, who bears a scar on her neck where her son once sliced her. `` Once he gets the wine, he goes crazy.'' The abusers many times have their own problems: drug and alcohol abuse, unemployment, money, mental illness. Violence may be repayment for abuse a son or daughter received. A cramped house may spark it; middle-aged children free at last of their own children may resent the intrusion of a frail parent. In some cases, it's the stress of caring for an elderly parent. Paramedics answering a call in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> found 77-year-old <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeter </PERSON> covered with excrement and maggots in a filthy bedroom. She died five hours later. The woman's daughter, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeter </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 39, had promised her mother not to put her in an old folks' home, said Prosecutor <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. A probation report found Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> `` was under a degree of emotional distress.'' She pleaded no contest April 12 to elder abuse and was ordered to begin psychiatric counseling and perform 300 hours of community service. She did not return several calls requesting an interview. `` The idea that people for some reason or another do not want to put their loved ones in a nursing home or feel they have to be responsible for total care is fairly common in these cases,'' said <PERSON> Rosalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Aging at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Part of the solution is getting seniors to take responsibility for stopping and even preventing abuse, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, assistant manager of criminal justice services for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>. The elderly should keep regular appointments and stay in touch with old friends, especially if they move in with a relative, <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said. They should have someone stop by once a week to make sure all is well. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Victim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> offers a 24-hour hotline, individual and group counseling and help in court, getting locks changed, and finding shelter, transportation and clothing. In a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> group called Safe Place, the elderly hesitantly confide what has happened to them and try to make sense of it. `` People just believe and hope so much that this will be the last time, things will change, he wo n't do it again. But they do,'' said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Walcott </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> and leader of Safe Place. In many cases, the parents blame themselves, Ms. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. `` They say ` Well, how did I bring up this monster?''' Forty-two states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have statutes requiring reporting of elder abuse, but those involved with the cases say the nation has a long way to go toward recognizing the problem. The states spend an average $ 22 per abused child, but just $ 2.90 for each abused older person, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> found. Its report recommended emergency shelters, tax credits for families caring for older adults, amendments to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid eliminating limitations on benefits and services to elderly people cared for by family members at home, and mandatory reporting of abuse. `` It's so foreign to our thinking,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>. `` Doctors wo n't even ask if abuse has taken place. It's possible the person, once cured, will be sent back to the same environment, possibly to be killed.''

<HEAD>Banks Zero in on Affluent and Fast-Growing Senior Set</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When it comes to the nation's fastest growing population, several demographic truths apply: They are affluent, interested in getting the most for their buck and over 55 years old. But do n't call them senior citizens. `` It's instant death,'' said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who developed <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Five </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s program for older customers. `` In the early going, some banks made the mistake of pitching accounts with names like Golden Years,'' said <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Blasco </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Since the early 1980s, banks around the nation have been paying more attention to their older customers. Government figures project a 40 percent increase in the number of people over 50 during the next 10 years as the baby boom generation ages. This group earns $ 900 billion dollars a year and controls 75 percent to 80 percent of financial assets in the marketplace. `` Those are numbers that say this is an important segment,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Munsell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shawmut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` They're there and have big dollars. But they're sophisticated and elusive.'' <PERSON> Munsell </PERSON>, who did considerable research in developing the <ORGANIZATION> Shawmut </ORGANIZATION> 55 program, said the mature bank customer is anything but an easy sell. They are very well-read and, in some cases, have the time to look into and carefully compare what banks offer. `` These people are astute,'' he said. Retirement account managers agree the most important point in wooing the over-55 set is they regard themselves as anything but `` older.'' `` Most of these people consider themselves about 10 years younger than they are,'' said <PERSON> Blasco </PERSON>, an assistant vice president. `` They do n't feel their age and are much more active than prior generations.'' When <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in 1982 designed a package of financial and banking services for older customers it was an anomaly, said <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, retirement market manager. Now, the competition is fierce. `` Everybody is finally realizing that it's a very important population.'' And the scramble has just begun, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, consultant and author of `` Banking on the Mature Customer.'' `` There's going to be some real warfare out there as more and more attractive programs are made available to the seniors. Up till now, most banks have targeted the young urban professional market. But suddenly they're realizing that 60 to 85 percent of their savings balance is held by people over the age of 50.'' To appeal to that market, hundreds of banks have adopted programs like <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>'s Senior Partners program. Specialized services have become standard. Customers over 55 can expect free checking, travelers and cashiers cheques. Special financial planning guides and accidental death insurance have become de rigeur. And any bank worth its salt is liable to have a newsletter addressed to `` the mature banking customer,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. In addition to standard banking discounts, marketing directors said their older customers are interested in travel, entertainment and medical benefits. `` They're no longer acquiring and are instead in the appreciation stage of life,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, an assistant marketing manager at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> ive. A <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> bank offers older customers free memberships to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Magic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Years </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and a pocketsized computer card containing the client's entire medical history. But travel perks and dining discounts are n't high on some seniors' lists, and many seniors banking programs require minimum balances of as much $ 10,000, excluding many people on fixed incomes, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a consumer affairs specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our concern is for those who through deregulation and increased fees have found banking services beyond their budget,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. `` In many places banking services are beyond the reach of low - or moderate-income people. Between 70 percent and 80 percent of banks offer free checking with no minimum balance to people over age 60, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> McEldowney </PERSON> of Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based advocacy group. But banks generally do n't advertise them or notify customers they are eligible, and `` the advertising ends up targeting at the well-heeled consumers in an attempt to persuade them to open an account with lots of frills and whistles when in fact such an account may not be as advantageous as a more stripped-down account,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> has lobbied for increased sensitivity to older consumers' needs in all sectors, and in particular banks, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said `` Seeing, hearing and moving may be diffficult for older consumers. And older consumers still very much like one-on-one-contact with individuals at the bank tellers.'' Straight talk about banking service options is another thing older customers want, she said. Banks have `` devised so many investment vehicles that it's hard to comparison shop and to know what you're getting into.''

<HEAD>Congress Moves to Add Barriers to Bias After High Court Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A little-noticed <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling making it easier for employers to limit older workers' fringe benefits has spurred members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to seek age-discrimination barriers many thought had been in place for decades. Lawmakers and advocates for the elderly are pushing legislation to nullify the June 23 ruling that bias in benefits such as health and retirement plans is not automatically banned under the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In the wake of the ruling, `` employers are probably going to start tightening up'' on what fringes they offer to older workers, said <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlich </PERSON>, an attorney with the National Senior Citizens Law Center. `` Employers may start rethinking how they're going to provide benefits.'' However, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm, <PERSON> McGuiness </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, represents management in employment cases, said companies are n't likely to make major cutbacks that would hurt worker morale. `` There's a labor shortage in a lot of areas. Instead of laying off people, they want to keep them. I'm not sure people would want to stay with an employer who said everyone over age 65 is going to lose benefits,'' <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said. The government has long interpreted the age discrimination act as letting employers limit fringes for older workers only if it would cost more to offer them the same benefits given younger employees, for example life insurance. But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> case, said the law bans biased benefit plans only in cases where the disparities are part of an intent to discriminate in `` some non-fringe-benefit aspect,'' of employment, such as hiring or firing. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, in a strong dissent from the 7-2 majority decision, said the ruling `` immunizes virtually all employee benefit programs from liability'' under the age discrimination act. `` It is difficult to believe that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ... intended to immunize acts of unabashed discrimination against older workers,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Deets </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>, said that while the ruling got little attention amid the excitement over long-awaited court decisions on abortion and flag-burning, it was `` an absolute shocker'' to the aging community. `` For years the assumption has been that benefits are covered under the age discrminiation act, as would be hiring and firing,'' <PERSON> Deets </PERSON> said. `` This puts older workers at a distinct disadvantage.'' The decision came in a lawsuit filed by <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>, who began working in 1978 as a speech pathologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retardation </ORGANIZATION> and Developmental Disabilites. When her work deteriorated, due to Alzheimer's disease, the 61-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Betts </PERSON> in 1985 was given the choice of unpaid medical leave or retiring with a standard pension of $ 158.50 a month. Because she was over 60, she was denied a third option of disability retirement with benefits of $ 355 a month. Lower courts upheld Ms. <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>' contention that it was a violation of the act to deny disability benefits solely because of her age, but the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had `` left the employee benefit battle for another day'' when it enacted the anti-discrimination law in 1967. The <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which enforces the age discrimination act, filed a brief supporting Ms. <PERSON> Betts </PERSON> and stating its belief that the law required `` some sort of cost justification in order to permit an employer to avoid a charge of discrimination.'' The court's ruling to the contrary is under review, and its impact on cases pending has not been determined, said <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. The ruling's biggest impact will be in disability and severance benefits, which sometimes are designed to convert to pensions at a certain age or after a specified time, according to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> of Towers, <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> consulting firm that often represents employers. But most employers already are accustomed to applying the act to benefit plans and are unlikely to make big changes because of the Betts ruling, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. Any after-effects of the ruling could well be short-lived, given widespread interest on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in obviating it. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION>, has introduced legislation to extend age discrimination barriers to fringe benefits, and Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, also is considering legislative options. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION>, said he would introduce legislation `` We in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not allow older workers to go unprotected in such a critical part of the employment relationship as employee benefit plans.''

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> retired four years ago from a career that included three decades as a TV producer and several stints as a Broadway performer, he planned to play a lot of golf. A few months later, though, he found himself in 16th-century garb, serenading crowds at the <ORGANIZATION> Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardens </ORGANIZATION> theme park four days a week. `` I think it's kept me young,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 64, who enjoys mingling with the crowds and bestowing kisses on female tourists between shows. Park owner <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> is among several local employers who have taken advantage of the growing number of business and government retirees settling in planned communities around this small historic city. Colonial <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, the College of <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <LOCATION> James </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> all have benefited from retirees with decades of experience willing to work part-time for little or no pay. `` What may make it unusual is the retirees here are those in the upper-income range,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, county budget director. `` We also see early retirees, retirees in their mid-50s who are still very active people and are still continuing to look for challenges.'' <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> hired one of those, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickmok </PERSON> at the helm of a station he founded, massaging listeners daily with his gentle yet authoritative and mellifluous voice, a throwback to an era when radio was king. At 68, white-haired and mustachioed, <PERSON> Shoecraft </PERSON> is an engaging entrepreneur, raconteur, on-air pro and civic-minded world traveler. He's also an example for others, though he insists on minimizing that. When <PERSON> Shoecraft </PERSON> started June 1, 1939, just out of <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, changing records at <ORGANIZATION> KGLU </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Safford </LOCATION>, he worked 70 hours a week, including the 6 a.m. sign-on to 12:15 a.m. sign-off on alternating Sundays as record master of ceremonies, `` whatever that is.'' The pay was $ 10 a week. In those days the dial was less cluttered. There were six stations on the air in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, compared with more than 180 today. `` It was the prime entertainment in those days, and it probably was fed a lot by the Depression,'' <PERSON> Shoecraft </PERSON> says. `` If you could get enough to buy a radio, this was your family entertainment, and it was free.'' Standard fare included <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> and the Kraft Music Hall, the Firestone Hour, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Toscanini </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>. `` The best entertainmment in the whole world, comedy and music and, it really meant more. To my way of thinking, it's still just as magnetic if it's done right. Of course, the competition now is fierce.'' <PERSON> Shoecraft </PERSON>, self-taught, has met that competition with his own brand of `` little-town radio'' a comfortable mix of talk, information, music and general help, plus a large dose of local news. `` If it's news in Globe, we've got it.'' The philosophy is simple: interact with listeners. Here's the formula: _ A morning `` Open Line'' call-in show; _ `` The <ORGANIZATION> Money </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION>,'' offering $ 20 or more to callers who correctly answer five true-false questions, like whether President <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> sold his memoir rights in 1953 to the Saturday Evening Post -LRB- he did n't; they went to Life magazine -RRB-; _ `` <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>,'' a daily swap shop _ Requests for work, clothing or other help for local needy citizens Then there are <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>' baseball and other sports. `` He's been so involved in the community through the radio station,'' says <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` He caters to just so many people.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, a close friend since childhood, says <PERSON> Shoecraft </PERSON>'s `` word is as good as his signature. But `` he's a poor poker player.'' It's often diffficult to get a straight answer from Shoecraft, <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> says. `` I think I'm the only one who can outjoke him at times.'' <PERSON> Shoecraft </PERSON> has lived in Globe since 1943. In 1958, he went on the air with his own station, KIKO-AM, originally broadcasting from the lobby of the Copper Hills Hotel. Eventually, he struck a deal with <ORGANIZATION> Inspiration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to build a mobile-home park, and moved KIKO into one. He built stations in <LOCATION> Safford </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON> and sold them, then in 1979 established KIKO-FM, with the highest FM signal possible, carrying 80 miles into <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Over the years, he's made the most of turning bad luck into good fortune. For instance, there was the time a hunter shot a telephone line, jumbling signals so a conversation between two women was broadcast over KIKO. <PERSON> Shoecraft </PERSON> faced a threat of being sued until he became friends with one of the women and her husband. And the woman's sister, <PERSON> Billie </PERSON>, whom he married <PERSON> Shoecraft </PERSON> played piano in a bar, served on the city council and as vice mayor, and once ran for the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was soundly beaten,'' he says. He served on the hospital and industrial development boards and was active in scouting. He and <PERSON> Billie </PERSON>, who died in 1976, raised three sons: an accountant-developer and noted balloonist, an attorney and a school administrator. He subsequently married <PERSON> Billie </PERSON>'s nurse, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>. Now, <PERSON> Shoecraft </PERSON> is running KIKO a second time. He sold the stations in 1987 for $ 1.75 million and bought back the AM station in June 1988 for $ 125,000. He provided `` a vehicle for people to vent their feelings, sometimes in anger, sometimes in excitement, sometimes in joy, but whatever, the people have had an opportunity to be part of that radio station,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> says. One other thing sets <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoecraft </PERSON> a bit apart: Since an accident when he was 8, he has had no legs. It's one of the few things he does n't talk much about.

 The message today is simple: BEWARE THE SUMMER SUN! Too many people, especially older people, become needlessly ill because they fail to recognize the potential dangers of the sun and its heat. However, the two great dangers, heatstroke and skin cancer, are largely preventable. Symptoms of heatstroke occur almost instantly and can be immediately fatal, while skin cancer develops years after exposure to the sun's rays. If you must be exposed to the heat, drink plenty of water or fruit and vegetable juice, even if you are n't thirsty. Avoid alcohol and caffeine. Dress in light-weight, light-colored, loose clothes. Limit activity in the hottest part of the day and keep meals simple and light. If they are available, use air conditioners liberally. Trips to cool places are good alternatives. If you are a relative, friend, or neighbor of a person who is unable to get around you may want to offer transportation. Older people are especially vulnerable to heat-related illnesses. Changes in the body that may affect ability to cope with heat include inefficient sweat glands, poor circulation and changes in the skin. Also, some older people have illnesses that cause weakness or fever which, in turn, affect their ability to cope with heat. Heart, lung, and kidney diseases are good examples. Diseases requiring special diets also may make a person more vulnerable to heatstroke. People with high blood pressure, for example, reduce the amount of salt in their diets. Yet this reduction may increase the risk of heat stress. -LRB- A word of caution _ salt should not be increased nor salt supplements taken without consent from a physician. -RRB- Medications like diuretics, sedatives, tranquilizers and certain heart and blood-pressure drugs may contribute to a body's inability to regulate internal temperature. But never stop medication or change a recommended diet without consulting a doctor. Unusually heavy or underweight people also are at risk, as are those who drink alcoholic beverages regularly. Anyone suspected of suffering a heat-related illness should receive attention. Victims of heatstroke exhibit a body temperature of 104 degrees or higher. The pulse may be rapid. Other symptoms include flushed skin, a faint feeling, confused and bizarre behavior and combativeness. These symptoms require immediate emergency medical assistance. Heat fatigue and heat exhaustion are milder forms of heat stress. Should you suspect either illness look for giddiness, nausea, profuse sweating, and a cold and clammy feeling and take steps to prevent the condition from worsening. First, and perhaps most obvious, the person needs to get out of the sun and into a cool, preferably air-conditioned place. Encourage sponging off with cool water or taking a cool bath or shower and non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated drink. Another serious danger associated with the sun and aging is skin cancer. Whether you are 15 or 50 your skin is accumulating sun damage, including wrinkling, various growths and skin cancers and change in texture. By following some easy sun-safety tips many skin cancers can be prevented. Do n't sunbathe too long. Try to limit exposure between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. and get used to the sun gradually. Wear a hat, long-sleeved shirt, and W-rated -LRB- ultraviolet -RRB- sunglasses. Use sunscreens liberally and apply them at least one hour before going out. Reapply after swimming or sweating. Sunscreens are effective at SPF -LRB- sun protection factor -RRB- 15. Prolonged exposure to the sun can cause skin cancer. The most common forms are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. Basal cell carcinomas are the most common and rarely harmful to vital organs. Squamous cell carcinomas are less common but are potentially harmful because they can grow quickly and spread to other organs. Malignant melanomas often look like dark, irregular moles. They can be deadly. If you suspect skin cancer see a doctor. Warning signs include a new mole-type spot or changes in color, size, shape or texture of an existing one. With early detection and prompt treatment, many skin cancers can be cured. Even if you have had a benign cancer you must guard against the dangers of the sun. With good, sound judgment and a knowledge of preventive measures the hot summer months can be safe and fun for everyone.

 EDITOR'S NOTE: <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bria </PERSON> retired from the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 after 40 years that included coverage of World War II from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.

 Plants do n't care how old you are. A rose blushes as sweetly for the 80-year-old gardener as for one 50 years younger. With age, a tennis serve loses its zing and a golf drive its distance, but your daffodils will dance in the wind as sprightly as ever. <PERSON> Augusta </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> took to gardening before she was 10, helping her grandmother in the red soil of a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> vegetable patch. `` I was the only one of the grandchildren she would let in the garden because I remembered the names of things. I was alway asking questions. I wanted to know why things grew the way they did.'' Now 81 and ailing, <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> still finds the garden a main pleasure in life. People in Pound Ridge, a country town 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, have long thought of <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> and her lawyer husband, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 82, as `` Mr. and Mrs. Garden.'' Most every town has elderly couples like them, who, seeking beauty and flavor, have put a lifetime into raising flowers and vegetables with skill and dedication. And many newly retired seniors are looking to the garden to fill the leisure hours. But <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> warns that a gardener `` has to get grimy and dirty and enjoy what comes out of real work. If you're one of those people who are afraid to get your fingernails soiled or broken and you do n't want to put on dirty old jeans and old sneakers and get out and dig, you're not really a gardener.'' Ailments keep her from doing as much now. She's `` concentrating more and more on flowers and herbs.'' But, leaning on her stick, <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> helps out at every event put on by the <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, of which she was once president. She supervises the care of the library grounds. But mostly she likes to look at her perennials renewing themselves in the spring, like the lavender clematis that has showed 300 blooms. In his youth in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> worked as an attorney for the War Department, but briefly tended a Victory Garden in <LOCATION> Mamaroneck </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Augusta </PERSON> remembers his vegetables were so good that `` he was robbed often; people would come in the middle of the night and take things.'' After the war, the <ORGANIZATION> Carters </ORGANIZATION> moved to a 1737 house on acreage in <LOCATION> Pound </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, which since has become a National Landmark. Even as <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> commuted daily by train to his law firm in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, he became more and more involved in his garden. `` I'd get up at 4:30 and get my gardening done then Otherwise I would n't keep abreast of it There was n't enough time.'' Before leaving for his train, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> would pick a flower for his buttonhole, and he became known to fellow commuters as the man who always wore a flower. For years now the <ORGANIZATION> Carters </ORGANIZATION> have been going back South in the winter to a house, and another garden, in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> and they'll define for you expertly the nuances of southern and northern horticulture. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> has also been ailing lately and has cut his outdoor work sharply. But he likes to take you around his Pound Ridge grounds and point out interesting plants, like his off-season Egyptian onions. In the vegetable patch, he shows how yearly mulching with autumn leaves has enriched the soil to a deep, dark brown. His daughter, <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON>, helped put in the tomatoes this year. Keeping up the family tradition, <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> has also headed the Garden Club. Talking with the <ORGANIZATION> Carters </ORGANIZATION> in their comfortable sitting room, you get a sense of the soul of the garden. <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> appreciates but does n't agree with an old saying that people like to garden `` because the plants do n't talk back.'' She thinks plants `` have a lot to say without talking,'' that they'll let you know by sign language if they need more sun or rain or a richer soil. She also says, `` It's the care you give a rose that brings out the better rose.'' Any wisdom she'd pass on? `` You do n't have a garden just for yourself. You have it to share. But you have to be willing to do the work.''

<HEAD>Mom-and-Pop Research Company Builds A Better Safety Cap </HEAD>

<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Kids do n't think like grownups. With that simple premise and a $ 50,000 grant from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, a mom-and-pop research company has come up with a child-proof cap it hopes will make life easier for older Americans. The caps designed by <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> do n't rely on an adult's strength or dexterity. Instead, they require two cognitive skills that children aged 3 to 5 do n't have: Read the directions, then do some things in a specified sequence, such as push, twist, THEN pull. The designs `` were similar to simple combination locks,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>. The Hunters recruited 26 adults, aged 60 to 75, from the <ORGANIZATION> Bozeman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and 20 3 - to 5-year-olds from the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a preschool associated with <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, to test three cap designs `` It was a much smaller group than you'd need to come to definite conclusions, but two of the designs were virtually child-proof. No children opened them. One child almost 5 -LCB- opened one of the designs,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. The children seemed familiar with the now-commonplace safety caps, but were thwarted by the sequence requirements, she said. Ninety percent of the adults opened the caps and 80 percent rated them easy or very easy to use. A recent Gallup Poll of older Americans found that the No. 1 problem of daily life was opening medicine, the Hunters said. Safety packaging is optional on prescription drugs, and many older people, especially arthritics, refuse it. One result, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, is that one of every six children poisoned by a prescription medicine each year has taken a grandparent's medication. The Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is considering a staff proposal to test packaging for medicines and toxic household chemicals on elderly people as well as the children it is meant to protect. People over 65 receive 25 percent of all prescriptions, but testing uses only 18 - to 45-year-olds, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 3 billion-a-year packaging manufacturer, has asked to look at the Hunters' findings.

<HEAD>Computerized Phone Program to Monitor Elderly Living Alone</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A computer that makes up to 100 phone calls an hour can alleviate one of the fears of elderly people living alone _ being undiscovered for days after being stricken suddenly at home by illness. `` There is a large percentage of elderly that live alone with a pre-existing medical conditions and nobody to check on them,'' <LOCATION> Youngtown </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Branham </PERSON> said recently, announcing plans to install the system. The service _ R.U.O.K., coined by developer <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> for `` Are you OK?'' _ is being installed in the <LOCATION> Youngtown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. R.U.O.K. was first installed in <LOCATION> Osage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, in March 1988 and has been started in about 15 cities, including in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, in July. `` It's a real simple system,'' <PERSON> Branham </PERSON> said. `` A computer modem hooks to a telephone and calls the elderly person. If they do n't answer the phone, the computer re-logs the number and recalls it eight minutes later. If there is no answer, a computer sends a printout of the person's name and condition to a police dispatcher, who will send an officer. The computer dials up to 100 phones an hour and should be able to serve about 500 people. A person may have the computer call any number of times in a day, <PERSON> Branham </PERSON> said. `` Everyone will get at least one call every 24 hours.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who attended a news conference kicking off the <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION> system, `` If a person can answer the phone, we assume he's OK enough to call for help. This program is aimed at those who ca n't answer. The cost varies. Phoenix-area civic groups raised $ 7,000 to start R.U.O.K.; <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION> police came up with $ 3,600 for theirs.

<HEAD>Bjorn Borg's Business Nearly Bust, Reports Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The business empire of <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> is being liquidated and could go bankrupt because the retired tennis star has refused a bid for new working capital, media reports said Monday. <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> <PERSON> Enterprises </PERSON> was hit by a cash crisis after <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> refused a $ 4.6 million infusion to cover the expansion in <ORGANIZATION> Bjorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Borg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a fragrance and fashion company, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> and the nationa news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> said. The financing plan was offered by Swedish financier <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyllenhammar </PERSON> and would have allowed <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> to remain the majority owner, the reports said. Further details of the plan were not disclosed. The <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> company office in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> did not answer the telephone Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> as saying he would not comment. Business partners quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> and by <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> had given `` no explanation'' for his decision to refuse the financing plan at a board meeting Thursday. Aftonbladet and <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> said the company board resigned, including <PERSON> Hakan </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisinger </PERSON>, a former managing director of automaker <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Borg </PERSON>'s partner <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Skarke </PERSON>, who owns a 25 percent share in the group, told <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> one reason for needing new working capital was brisk sales. <PERSON> Stig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sjoholm </PERSON>, a lawyer and vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Bjorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Borg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> group, told <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> turnover had quadrupled in the past year. `` It is possible our expansion has been too rapid on certain points,'' he said. The Monte Carlo-based <ORGANIZATION> Bjorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Borg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> owned companies which designed and marketed a line of quality fashions and fragrances, and was involved in Swedish real estate. <PERSON> Borg </PERSON>, 33, founded his empire on the winnings of a 10-year professional tennis career, including an unmatched five consecutive championships at <LOCATION> Wimbledon </LOCATION>, from 1976 through 1980, and six French Open crowns. By the time he retired from the circuit in 1983, he was estimated to have amassed $ 75 million in prizes and endorsements.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Private businesses have been asked to freeze prices for an unspecified period following similar measures taken by state-run enterprises earlier this month, the Al-Ittihad weekly reported Monday. The weekly, published by the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> federation of chambers of commerce and industry, said the price freeze was requested in accordance with the government's inflation-fighting efforts. `` Continually rising prices have led to stagnation and halted the market's expansion,'' <PERSON> Abul </PERSON> <PERSON> Qader </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Latif </PERSON>, the federation's chairman said `` Private entrepreneurs have been depicted as greedy and as hindering development of the national economy.'' The government's call came just a few days after it raised state employees' salaries by $ 80 a month in their first pay hike in more than 10 years. The government also froze prices of goods and services provided by state-run enterprises for one year from July 1. Prices soared last year after a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire took effect Aug. 20 in the 8-year Iran-Iraq war. Prices for some foods doubled recently in a new wave of price increases. A pack of 30 eggs that used to cost $ 6.60 now sells for $ 12.80. A two-pound chicken that cost $ 5.60 now costs $ 12.16. The government is currently subsidizing basic foods such as flour and cooking oil. It also restricted access to state-run stores where goods are sold more cheaply to Iraqis working for the government.

 <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the subject of intense takeover speculation for the past two weeks, today announced a major restructuring program that includes reducing its weapons business and cutting 4,000 jobs. The company said it also planned to repurchase up to 10 million shares of its common stock on the open market and to sell a `` substantial portion'' of its 50 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Yamatake-Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese controls maker. Analysts have valued that holding at nearly $ 1 billion. The sweeping program will result in a 65-cent increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth-quarter dividend, to $ 2.75 a share, and could include a special cash dividend, said Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Renier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> said he expected the restructuring to improve operating profits by about $ 150 million over the next 18 months. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> is the leading manufacturer of torpedoes for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and also supplies small, medium and large ammunition to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON> said. Wall Street greeted today's announcement with open arms. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> jumped $ 3.37 -LCB- to $ 88.87 -LCB- in active late-morning trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, following a delayed opening. <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> said the reduction of <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s weapons business is part of a strategy begun in 1988 to `` concentrate on core controls businesses that principally serve commercial markets as well as the market for military and space controls.'' The reduction will `` proceed over time in a responsible manner that recognizes the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's interest in these businesses so as not to adversely affect national security interests, our government program obligations, or the value of these businesses to <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> shareholders,'' <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> said. The weapons business accounts for about 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s revenue. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON>, a company spokeswoman, would not say whether a sale of the business is one of the options being considered. However, <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON> said negotiations to sell the company's stake in <ORGANIZATION> Yamatake-Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, which is listed on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, will begin within a few days. She would not identify potential buyers. Japanese investors currently own half of the company, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring program will include the elimination of 4,000 jobs worldwide over the next 18 months, including 300 corporate staff positions targeted in a previous announcement. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> currently employs about 78,000 workers. Many of the job cuts will be made through attrition, but layoffs will be necessary, <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON> said. The company had announced last month that it would lay off 300 employees. Today's restructuring announcement follows speculation that <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> is a takeover target. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price has risen sharply in the last two weeks following published reports that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was considering acquiring the company. The takeover rumors began after the company announced that it lost $ 435 million in fiscal 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s second-quarter profit jumped to $ 74.8 million, or $ 1.73 a share, from $ 31.6 million, or 75 cents a share, in 1988. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON>, a securities analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said today's announcement could deter a takeover attempt, although it wo n't guarantee independence for <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are trying to basically boost the stock price to make it more difficult for someone to take them over,'' <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> said. `` It will also alleviate some of the large shareholders who have been pounding on the door. They are doing the things they have to do to deter a takeover.''

 Stock prices in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> surrendered a portion of their recent gains Monday as the market experienced a technical correction after its sharp move forward in recent weeks.

<HEAD>Capital Gains: More Than Rich Vs. Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many of the economic considerations of a proposed capital gains tax cut now have become obscured by politics and reduced to a question: Would a cut be a gift to the rich at the expense of the poor? Some studies say it would be, the reasoning being that most capital-gain dollars, or financial gains on appreciation of long-term assets, are earned by the wealthy. Internal Revenue Service figures document it. Those figures show, for instance, that in 1986 the group with total income of $ 1 million or more earned more than one-third of all capital gains. The percentage often has been cited in defense of the rich vs. poor argument. Less often cited are data from the same source showing that people with medium or low income constitute nearly 18 percent of capital gains earners, and that they might fare worse than the rich. Moreover, says <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Utt </PERSON>, former deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, those figures must be read with a very serious caveat: that some relatively poor people may become `` rich'' once in their lives. Once is enough, however, statistically to catapult them into the higher brackets. <PERSON> Utt </PERSON>, now a fellow at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, observes that even relatively poor people can be hit hard by capital gains. Who? An elderly widow selling her home, a parent selling stock to pay for a child's education. It also might be a hard-working citizen who sells a business, or almost anyone who tediously saved a few thousand dollars in a mutual fund, or a divorced couple selling a home into which they had poured hearts and dollars. For one year, the year in which they disposed of their assets, they became rich for tax purposes, forever leaving their imprint on the national statistics and their own financial well being. The tendency to view capital gains, and capital gains taxes, as affecting only the rich led to obscuring another economic consideration when the tax was raised from a maximum of 20 percent to a maximum of 28 percent in 1986. That increase did indeed impact the rich; it was, after, all a 40 percent increase. Often overlooked then, and now, is the fact that under the old rules the taxes of many low and middle-income taxpayers amounted to only 14 percent. They too jumped to 28 percent, doubling in one legislative swipe. That was part of the increase. Because of legislative action at the state level, or because state tax rates were based on the federal model, state taxes also rose, some between 100 percent and 200 percent. An economic consideration often referred to by supporters of a capital gains tax cut is the injustice of taxing people on capital gains income never earned. The tax is applied quite literally to the inflated value of assets. But while taxing people on inflation may be unreasonable, it is seldom pointed out that the assets involved may have grown more swiftly because taxes were deferred until sold. That observation also seems to have been forgotten. Important also, is the potential significance of capital gains taxes for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a global competitor. Capital gains taxes are not universal; they are rare, restricted mainly to such industrial giants as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ which has the highest _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. In a 1987 report, the accounting firm <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> pointed out that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> exempted long-term capital gains. Also exempting them were <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, all on a fast track to industrial might and competitive power. These and many other economic considerations have been overwhelmed in the heat of the political battle, a battle that seems to have distilled the important issues to just one.

 <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its second-quarter earnings rose 23.1 percent, including a double-digit increase in operating income from broadcasting despite a flat performance by its <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. Another media concern, <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, said its profit jumped 34.5 percent in the first six months of the year as it continued a cost-cutting effort begun after the October 1987 stock market crash. The book publisher <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its profit rose 10 percent for the second quarter on a 16 percent revenue increase. Capital Cities-ABC, which also has interests in the <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> cable network and in book, newspaper and specialty publishing, said it earned $ 140.2 million, or $ 7.83 per share, in the three months ended July 2 compared with $ 113.9 million, or $ 6.78 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 6 percent to $ 1.23 billion in the quarter from $ 1.16 billion a year earlier. Operating income for the New York-based communications company rose 8 percent to $ 264.5 million in the quarter, including a 10 percent increase in broadcasting, 3 percent in publishing and gains in newspapers, offsetting declines in the specialized publications. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Networ </ORGANIZATION> had no increase in its operating earnings as increased costs associated with coverage of major news events and the telelcast of the mini-series `` War & amp; Remembrance'' offset revenue increases. In addition to the TV network, <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> owns eight television stations, six radio networks and 21 radio stations. Earnings in the latest quarter also benefitted from $ 27.1 million in interest income, up from $ 7.9 million for the same period a year ago. For the first six months, <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> had net income of $ 222.9 million, or $ 12.40 a share, up 21 percent from $ 184.2 million, or $ 10.93 a share, a year earlier. Six-month revenue slipped 4.1 percent to $ 2.35 billion from $ 2.45 billion a year earlier, reflecting the inclusion of revenue from the Winter Olympics coverage in 1988. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> said its profit came to 85.3 million pounds, or $ 132.2 million. The per share increase was 20.6 pence, or 32 cents. The figures compared with 63.4 million pounds, or 15.1 pence a share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue for the half rose 16.3 percent to 548.3 million pounds, or $ 849.9 million, from 471.4 million pounds a year earlier. As a London-based company, <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> is not required to report quarterly results. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Renfrew </PERSON>, managing director and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>' profit growth accelerated in the first half of 1989.'' He said the company's core products `` maintained their strong progress despite continued problems in the financial markets. Substantial improvements were achieved in operating and profit margins.'' At the same time, he said cost-cutting steps taken last year held down the increase in several major categories of discretionary costs. <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> operates a news service and a number of information services used by traders and businesses. Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> said its profit rose to $ 10.5 million, or 74 cents a share, in the three months ended June 30 compared with $ 9.6 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter rose to $ 110.4 million from $ 95.1 million last year. Educational publishing sales rose 21 percent in the quarter, led by sales gains in the school and college divisions. General publishing sales slipped 9 percent, reflecting lower trade and reference book sales in comparison with unusually strong sales a year earlier. For the first six months of the year, <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mifflin </LOCATION> earned $ 749,000, or 5 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $ 15,000 for the period last year. Six-month revenue rose 14.6 percent to $ 154 million from $ 134.4 million.

 <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> said Monday he refused an offer of fresh capital to rescue his struggling fashion business built on earnings from his 10-year championship tennis career. <PERSON> Borg </PERSON>, 33, said he turned down $ 4.6 million to help <ORGANIZATION> Bjorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Borg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> because he was afraid of losing control of his companies. <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> said he was negotiating other financing to keep his business afloat. `` I remain committed to the business and am in the process of trying to reorganize the management and corporate structure of the group,'' <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Bjorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Borg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> produces a line of designer fashions, fragrances, shoes and accessories, and has real estate interests in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Skarke </PERSON>, who has a 25 percent stake in <PERSON> Borg </PERSON>'s companies, said the group was facing a `` a shortage of liquidity which is forcing the closure of the group.'' The company needs an infusion of cash to meet orders and finance further expansion, <PERSON> Skarke </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the Aftonbladet daily. <PERSON> Borg </PERSON>, the five-time <ORGANIZATION> Wimbeldon </ORGANIZATION> champion who retired from professional tennis in 1983, has boasted of his hands-on management style, making major business decisions on his own. <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> turned down an offer of 30 million kronor, or $ 4.6 million, by the <ORGANIZATION> Mercurius-Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> to buy into the holding company <ORGANIZATION> Bjorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Borg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> said the terms of the offer `` were not suitable to me as principal shareholder. As proposed to me, it would have meant surrendering financial control of the group.'' He said he `` was not satisfied that we had ironed out the financial problems'' and indicated there were other offers that also were unacceptable. <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> said the `` cost structure was too high for the income, notably in <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlo </LOCATION>, and I have taken the appropriate action to remedy this.'' <PERSON> Borg </PERSON>, who was pursued over the weekend amid reports the company was going bankrupt and being liquidated, promised a fuller public report on the group's future `` once negotiations have been concluded.'' <PERSON> Borg </PERSON>, who won Wimbledon from 1976-80 and also took six French Open titles, was estimated to have earned $ 75 million in prizes and endorsements when he retired. On his 1986 tax return, <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> placed his personal wealth at nearly $ 8 million. <PERSON> Borg </PERSON>'s financial woes compounded other personal problems, including a custody battle with his ex-girlfriend <PERSON> Jannike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjorling </PERSON> over his 3-year-old son <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, and plans to marry Italian rock singer <PERSON> Loredana </PERSON> <PERSON> Berte </PERSON>, which have been frustrated by delays in obtaining her divorce.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported nearly flat second-quarter earnings Monday, reflecting an increase in the banking company's provision for credit losses and higher non-interest expenses Net income for the three months ended June 30 totaled $ 174.6 million, or $ 2.14 a share, compared with earnings of $ 174.1 million, or $ 2.18 per share, the same time last year. For the first six months of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> netted $ 338.9 million, or $ 4.16 a share, up 13 percent from $ 300.1 million, or $ 3.79 a share, in 1988.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> dealt a fatal blow to <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 12.2 billion hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> today, upholding a lower court ruling allowing Time to proceed with a $ 14 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The ruling by the three-judge panel paves the way for Time to buy <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, creating the world's largest communications concern, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Paramount responded to the ruling by dropping its $ 200-a-share bid, seven weeks after it was announced The court's unanimous ruling, read by Justice <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Horsey </PERSON>, was brief: `` We find no error of law by the Court of Chancery.'' Paramount and some of Time's shareholders had asked the three-justice panel to overturn a ruling by <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. The judge said the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> deal, which was announced in March, three months before <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> launched its bid, was the result of long-term business planning and that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and Time's shareholders could not interfere. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, an attorney for some of the <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, said that because it was a unanimous ruling, the decision would not be appealed to the full state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which has five justices. Paramount said in a statement it was ending its bid for Time but would continue to try to expand through acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or partnerships. `` We believe in making bold moves when they are in the best interest of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> shareholders,'' <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` We have just demonstrated that in our offer for Time ...'' Time attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON> said Time would proceed as planned with its $ 70 a share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, which was scheduled to expire at 5 p.m. EDT. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> widely had been expected to uphold <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s ruling, and the justices' close questioning of the Paramount and shareholder attorneys during the two-hour hearing indicated they would rule in Time's favor Investors sold off Time stock as the hearing _ which was televised live by <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> _ proceeded. The company's shares were down $ 1.25 to $ 137.25 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading after the decision was announced <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was up $ 1 to $ 66.50 a share and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> was up 87 -LCB- cents to $ 58.37 -LCB- a share. At one point in today's hearing, Justice <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> G.T </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> asked of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, an attorney for some of Time's biggest shareholders, whether they were demanding that `` we must hold that a board is hostage to any person who walks in and makes a bid no matter what the long-term plans are.'' Paramount attorney <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON> contended today that <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law required the Time board to inquire into <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s bid, and reminded the three-judge panel that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a previous case had `` held that the failure to inquire is gross negligence.'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Savett </PERSON>, representing some of the shareholders, accused the Time board of passively sitting by while company management used the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> deal to entrench itself. The justices asked <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON>, the Time attorney, why the $ 70 a share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> _ which replaced an earlier stock-swap merger plan _ was not submitted to a vote by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders at the company's annual meeting in June. <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON> said a vote was not required because the deal did not involve the issuing of new Time stock. Furthermore, he said, after <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> launched its bid on June 6, the market for Time stock was in disarray and the price of the shares was gyrating. `` This was hardly the situation to have an unimpassioned evaluation of future value and get a fair vote,'' he said. <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON> contended Time's plans to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would give shareholders greater value in the long term than <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 200 a share offer. In its tender off for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 70 per share in cash for half of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s 200 million outstanding shares. Time will later exchange $ 70 in a combination of cash and securities for the remaining shares in what is called the deal's `` back end. The back end could take several months to complete. Paramount argued in a brief filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last week that <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s decision allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> board to proceed with the merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> although the deal was economically inferior to the <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> offer and therefore detrimental to <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. Paramount contended that <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s ruling would allow directors to reject any offers if they could point to some long-term corporate strategy. Time, in its brief, defended the right of its directors to determine the company's future course, and said previous <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> cases allow a board to refuse to consider offers that threaten long-term plans. The media giant argued that its long-term strategy should not be instantly negated by the launching of a hostile tender offer. Both companies claimed that the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1985 ruling in a case involving <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and takeover strategist <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> supported their arguments. That decision was written by Justice <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> G.T </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, one of the three jurists who had been scheduled to hear the Time case. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s decision effectively gave corporate directors leeway in rejecting offers and in setting a course for their companies. There was widespread speculation prior to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing today that an overturned decision would radically change the climate for friendly mergers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Many of the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations are incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and subject to its laws, and other states have modeled their statutes after <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported today that about 500 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> executives and employees would be paid a total of about $ 677 million under stock, option and bonus plans if the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> goes through. The Journal said the payments _ disclosed in minutes of a <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> board meeting June 15 _ amounted to the largest compensation package for employees of a company involved in a takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> would receive $ 193 million in payments and would also receive options on 1.8 million <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shares, the Journal said.

<HEAD>Success Of Mexico Debt Plan Hinges On Banks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Will be topped following late-afternoon administration briefing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A refinancing agreement between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and its creditor banks offers a glimmer of hope to the debt-strapped Third World, but success of the plan hinges on how far the banks are willing to go, government officials and private bankers said Monday. The administration, which provided a final push over the weekend to get the agreement, hailed the package as a landmark success for its debt-reduction initiative, unveiled by Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> on March 10. However, the banks that will implement the plan were more reserved in their enthusiasm, with many contending that it was too soon to say how much debt relief they will provide to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> because they were still examining the fine print of the agreement. `` At the moment we're exploring our options,'' <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitel </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a typical comment. `` We're looking at the entire -LRB- Third World -RRB- debt package.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration hopes to use the Mexican agreement to set a precedent that will facilitate debt relief in other countries, with <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> considered the two leading candidates to follow <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s lead. The administration has made debt reduction a key component of its foreign policy, believing that the only way to ensure the survival of emerging democracies in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is to reverse the decade-long slide in living standards caused by the crushing $ 1.3 trillion Third World debt burden. The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan for debt relief is seeking to slash this debt by establishing incentives to get commerical banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of the loans. However, banking analysts said it was unclear whether the incentives being offered in the Mexican package were sufficient to trigger a substantial writedown of the debt. In the case of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the debt-reduction package provides the commercial banks with three options. On the debt relief side, they can cut 35 percent off the face value of the current loans or they can agree to reduce interest rates to 6.25 percent, down from about 10 percent currently. Banks also have the option of simply providing new loans. The administration estimated that the various options could save <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> about $ 1.5 billion annually off the $ 5 billion to $ 5.5 billion it must pay to service its $ 54 billion in commercial bank debt. However, the administration stressed that this was a rough estimate and would vary depending on individual decisions made by the 500 commercial banks located in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that hold the Mexican debt. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> and a leading congressional expert on Third World debt, said that the Mexican agreement appeared seriously flawed because it did not provide enough incentives for banks to opt for the two debt reduction options rather than simply piling on new debt. `` A lot of the banks, without the necessary carrots or sticks, are going to stick with the familiar -LRB- approach of supplying -RRB- new money to pay old debt,'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said that approach has proven to be a disaster over the past seven years. Since 1982 when the debt crisis first erupted, Third World debt has more than doubled from $ 600 billion to the current $ 1.3 trillion. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> agreement did not represent any `` long-lasting breakthrough in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt situation.'' He said while the amount of debt-reduction was likely to be small, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would benefit in the next couple of years with an infusion of new money to get its economy started again. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> DRI-McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, said that the administration apparently failed to get as many concessions as they could from the commercial banks because they were so anxious to get an agreement. `` It looks like they desperately wanted to do a deal and get something signed to prove that their debt strategy could work,'' she said. `` It is a surface agreement that allows the administration to claim a success but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions.'' The administration had hoped that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be able to present a completed Mexican package during the seven-nation economic summit last week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. When that deadline was missed, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> stepped up his lobbying efforts. He brought the bankers and Mexican negotiators to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over the weekend for meetings at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, which were also attended by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. After two days of discussions at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, final agreement was reached late Sunday, in time for Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> to announce the breakthrough during a televised broadcast, saying the proposal would answer the `` the cry of Mexicans to return to growth.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> on Monday called for a study of <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> operations, in a followup of the soybean processor's criticism of the exchange's emergency order that required traders to reduce their holdings in soybean futures contracts. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and a member of <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee, said the emergency order illustrated that the exchange had failed to keep up with the global expansion of commodities trading. He said a study of the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> should look at its grain delivery system, regulations, market stability, committee structure and market trends. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said such a study should be undertaken by a group made up of soybean farmers, processors and others with a stake in the soybean market. `` The agricultural market is becoming truly global in nature. More than ever, it requires a strong and predictable <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` As it stands now, it is open to question whether the market is serving that function.'' The Board of Trade on July 11 ordered <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> _ part of the Italian grain conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fianziaria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION> _ and other major traders to liquidate contracts for July delivery or sale of millions of bushels of soybeans. That decision touched off wild swings in soybean prices and the exchange's action has been widely questioned by farm groups. <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> officials said the exchange was worried that soybean supplies were insufficient for meeting large holdings of contracts for July delivery of soybeans in the final days of trading in that contract. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> was holding contracts for delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans in July. He said those holdings were built up because of concerns <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> might not be able to fill export orders because of the reduction in soybean supplies due to the 1988 drought. `` It is both incredible and unacceptable that a market with international authority and, indeed, global responsibility, can be in a crisis over 20 million bushels of beans,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> refused to comment on <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>'s call for the study. However, a CBOT spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said the exchange conducts internal reviews on a regular basis. `` We have an entire department, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> and Planning, that reviews the market on a regular basis,'' said the spokesman. `` It adjusts contracts if they need adjusting.'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said that despite the global nature of the soybean market, the number of participants had declined. `` With fewer but larger players, hedging needs of the major firms have increased dramatically,'' he said. `` Do the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s operating practices accommodate this changed market? <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> also said a study should look into whether options have reduced futures trading and increased price volatility. Futures are contracts for the delivery of a specified amount of a commodity, such as soybeans, at a future time for a specific price. Options give a speculator the option to buy or sell futures contracts at a specific price during a certain period of time. `` Options are the preferred instrument of many farmers,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` When they enter to an options agreement, it puts a floor on the price. But they are free to take a better price should it occur.''

<HEAD>Profits Drop To A Third Of Last Year's Net At Unisys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings fell 67 percent in the latest quarter in spite of an 8 percent increase in revenue, the computer and defense contracting company said. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> attributed the sharp earnings drop to the expense of cutting inventories, pricing pressures from competitors, and the temporary suspension of its defense business by the Pentagon. Also, the rise in the dollar decreased the dollar value of sales made in foreign currencies. Net income was $ 53.6 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $ 2.57 billion, for the April-to-June period, compared to $ 162.3 million, or 78 cents a share assuming full dilution, in the similar 1988 period. Revenue grew to $ 2.57 billion from $ 2.39 billion a year earlier. For the first half of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> recorded a loss of $ 25.1 million in contrast to a profit of $ 311.6 million, or $ 1.60 a share assuming full dilution, in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the first six months this year was $ 4.78 billion, up narrowly from $ 4.76 billion in 1988. Three former units of <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were temporarily suspended from bidding on <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contracts from March 15 through June 23, 1989. The suspension stemmed from a federal investigation into government contract bidding procedures. Two former employees pleaded guilty to bribery and illegal political donations charges. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said the incidents occurred before <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> merged and became known as <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, but agreed to institute a company ethics program when the contract bidding suspension came to an end. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is rated the nation's 15th largest defense contractor and last year received $ 1.4 billion in contracts from the Pentagon.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday reported a slight drop in second-quarter earnings despite a 7 percent increase in sales. Second-quarter earnings were $ 186 million, or $ 1.33 per share, on sales of $ 2.28 billion, compared to earnings of $ 187 million, or $ 1.39 per share, on sales of $ 2.1 billion for the same period a year ago. Sales rose because of an increase in worldwide prices for ethylene glycol, but earnings were down due to an oversupply of polyethlylene, the company said. For the first six months of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 387 million, or $ 2.76 a share, compared to $ 288 million, or $ 2.14 a share, in the first half of last year. Revenue during the first six months were $ 4.5 billion, up from $ 4 billion in 1988. Union Carbide said all of its industry segments reported second-quarter sales increases. The segments include chemicals and plastics, industrial gases and carbon products.

 Stock prices pulled back today, reined in by uncertainty about the chances for lower interest rates anytime soon. The stock market moved broadly lower from the opening bell and various market measures finished near their worst levels of the session after an afternoon rebound ran out of steam. Wall Street analysts had anticipated today's selloff. Much of the force behind Friday's nearly 32-point surge in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average came from trading strategies tied to the expiration of July stock-related futures and options. With the conclusion of trading in those contracts, a major buying motivation disappeared. `` A lot of last week's activity was predicated on the futures and options expirations,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, director of technical research at <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Attention now has returned to the interest rate outlook. Financial markets have been building up their hopes for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to make a significant move toward a more generous credit policy but so far they have been disappointed. `` The market must now consider that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and the major commercial banks have not acted as aggressively as was hoped,'' said <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>. Earlier this month when <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> cut its prime lending rate to 10 -LCB- percent from 11 percent, it was widely assumed that its competitors would follow suit. But other major banks have demurred. <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON> said he thinks the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will continue to ease its hold on credit, but will do so in gradual, careful steps as it assesses the economy's condition.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday a previously announced restructuring plan would reduce its net profit by about $ 225 million in the second quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> also said its operating results, apart from the restructuring, were hurt by the `` artificially high value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar'' and the absence of expected efficiencies in manufacturing. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said the shortfall in operating results was `` very disappointing'' and said the company would take strong steps to address the situation, diclosing a plan in the near future. As for the restructuring charge, he said, `` This should be seen in a positive light. We are paying now for superior performance in 1990 and beyond.'' After announcing a 23 percent slide in first-quarter profit, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> said it would consolidate its photofinishing and consumer photography operations, steps that could cost hundreds of jobs. The $ 225 million charge will cover the cost of special separation payments to outgoing employees as well as the expense of writing off the book value of equipment, materials and goodwill. `` It was no surprise. They had mentioned the $ 200 million figure before,'' said <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiedenski </PERSON> of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harkness </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` But there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the company.'' Ms. <PERSON> Wiedenski </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> watchers are waiting for details of the company's restructuring plans and more information about divisions that incurred losses during the quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> will announce the second-quarter results on Aug. 1.

 The dollar fell against European currencies Monday but rose against the Japanese yen, which was hurt somewhat by political instability in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The yen lost some ground after the defeat of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in Sunday's parliamentary election and Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s announcement that he would resign. Most of the money flowing out of yen went into <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies, particularly the West German mark, dealers said. The dollar benefited less because of uncertainty about the future of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, they said. After climbing to nearly 1.92 West German marks in overseas trading, the dollar ended the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading day below 1.90 marks. `` There was n't a great deal of rhyme or reason to the dollar,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, chief dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Amsterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rotterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. As for the Japanese yen, he predicted, `` Until we see some kind of political resolution it's going to continue to be weak.'' Gold prices were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold bullion was bid at $ 372.60 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 372.25 late Friday. In spite of the dramatic political news, the yen's decline was slight. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> it actually rose against the dollar compared to Friday's levels. The dollar fell 0.20 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to a closing 141.95 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it rose to 142.40 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it rose to 142.55 yen from 141.85 on Friday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.6185, unchanged from late Friday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound rose against the dollar to $ 1.6260 from $ 1.6187. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with late Friday's rates included: 1.8970 West German marks, down from 1.9095; 1.6360 Swiss francs, down from 1.6485; 1.1887 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1879; 6.4275 French francs, down from 6.4750; and 1,369 Italian lire, down from 1,378.3 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Friday: 1.9085 West German marks, up from 1.9055; 1.6440 Swiss francs, down from 1.6455; 6.4600 French francs, up from 6.4460; 2.1490 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1350; 1,374.75 Italian lire, up from 1,371.50; 1.1890 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1880.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Monday hailed the new Mexican debt-reduction package as a breakthrough for its Third World debt strategy, but others were decidedly less enthusiastic. Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and private bankers said they believed the final agreement with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> offered a glimmer of hope for the debt-strapped Third World, but they said the success of the plan hinged on how far commercial banks would ultimately be willing to go. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, briefing reporters Monday, labeled the agreement between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and its commercial banks, reached late Sunday night, as a landmark agreement he said would establish a precedent to provide debt relief for other Third World countries, such as <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had been seen as the key test case for the administration's effort to reduce the burden of Third World debt, a strategy <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> unveiled March 10. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the agreement, if fully implemented by the commercial banks, would shave <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s annual interest rate payments by $ 1.5 billion, down about one-third from the current $ 5 billiion to $ 5.5 billion the country is paying on its commercial bank debt of $ 54 billion. In addition, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said that over four years, the amount of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s outstanding debt will be reduced by $ 10 billion to $ 12 billion from where it would have been had the deal not been struck. `` This is a fantastic change in circumstances,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said, although he conceded that the ultimate shape of the debt-relief package will depend on the willingness of commercial banks to participate. For their part, the commercial banks that hold <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt were more reserved, with many contending that it was too soon to say how much debt relief they will provide to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> because they were still examining the fine print of the agreement. `` At the moment, we're exploring our options,'' <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitel </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a typical comment. `` We're looking at the entire -LRB- Third World -RRB- debt package.'' The administration has made debt reduction a key component of its foreign policy, believing that the only way to insure the survival of emerging democracies in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is to find a way to reverse the decade-long slide in living standards caused by the crushing $ 1.3 trillion Third World debt burden. The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan for debt relief seeks to slash this debt by establishing incentives to get commerical banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of the loans. Banking analysts said it was unclear, however, whether the incentives being offered in the Mexican package were sufficient to trigger a substantial writedown of the debt by the 500 banks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that hold the loans. In the case of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the debt-reduction package provides the commercial banks with three options. On the debt-relief side, the banks can cut 35 percent off the face value of the current loans or they can agree to reduce interest rates to 6.25 percent, down from about 10 percent currently. Banks also have the option of simply providing new loans. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and a leading congressional expert on Third World debt, said that the Mexican agreement appeared seriously flawed because it did not provide enough incentives for banks to opt for the two debt-reduction options rather than simply piling on new debt. `` A lot of the banks, without the necessary carrots or sticks, are going to stick with the familiar -LRB- approach of supplying -RRB- new money to pay old debt,'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said that approach has proven to be a disaster over the last seven years. Since 1982, when the debt crisis first erupted, Third World debt has more than doubled from $ 600 billion to $ 1.3 trillion. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> agreement did not represent any `` long-lasting breakthrough in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt situation.'' He said that, while the amount of debt-reduction was likely to be small, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would benefit in the next couple of years with an infusion of money to get its economy started again. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> DRI-McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said that the administration apparently failed to get as many concessions as it could from the commercial banks because they were so anxious to get an agreement. `` It looks like they desperately wanted to do a deal and get something signed to prove that their debt strategy could work,'' she said. `` It is a surface agreement that allows the administration to claim a success but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions.'' The administration had hoped that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be able to present a completed Mexican package during the seven-nation economic summit last week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. When that deadline was missed, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> stepped up his lobbying efforts. He brought the bankers and Mexican negotiators to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over the weekend for meetings at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, which were also attended by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. After two days of discussions at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, final agreement was reached late Sunday, in time for Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> to announce the breakthrough during a televised broadcast, saying the proposal would answer the `` the cry of Mexicans to return to growth.''

 Supercomputer rivals <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday confirmed that they have agreed to license their patents to each other freely, but <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> said the pact does not allow for joint marketing or sharing of trade secrets. Previous press reports were mistaken in saying the pact would allow the two compaies to share information not yet patented, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, a spokesman for Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement to confirm the existence of the cross-licensing agreement but a spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> declined further comment. <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said such agreements are customary in the computer industry. But he said <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> is the first Japanese company to sign such an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>. Convex Computers of <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and Supertek Computers of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have similar agreements with <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said. `` The agreement gives each company freedom to pursue designs without having to be concerned about accidental design overlaps involving a patent held by the other company,'' <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said. `` If we should stumble onto one another's technology, we've agreed not to litigate.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the nationally circulated <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported earlier that the agreement would enable <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> to obtain unpatented technology from <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>, which has more experience in supercomputers. The reports quoted unidentified `` industry sources.'' <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> trade negotiator, said deals between high technology firms in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> draw the attention of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials because they have been using taxpayer money to build up American technology. <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON>, author of `` Trading Places,'' a book that advocates <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial policy to preserve American technology, said he has his `` eyebrows raised'' over the Cray-Hitachi deal. `` I wonder what lies behind it,'' he said, `` particularly why they chose <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> said the Japanese have benefited from an imbalanced flow of information between the two countries. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> gets more information than they give, more power to them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Energy Prices Plunge as Demand Weakens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Energy futures prices declined sharply Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on indications that demand for crude oil products is declining while supplies remain high. On other markets, copper prices were sharply higher, grain and soybean futures fell, livestock and pork prices finished mixed and precious metals were up slightly. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 14 cents to 77 cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 18.74 a barrel; heating oil was 1.47 cents to 1.96 cents lower with August at 49.70 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.31 cents to 1.39 cents lower with August at 53.16 cents a gallon. `` A lot of selling was caused by reduced concern over the availability of gas oil supplies out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON>, and analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The easing of the coal strike in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was expected to increase the availability of European energy products, analysts said. Gasoline prices plunged as demand for the fuel declines in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Analysts said demand dropped 2.5 percent in the first half of 1989. The market was also influenced by news that workers in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil field are calling off a work stoppage and expectations that Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report on oil stocks will show increased supplies. Copper prices rose sharply on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on news that copper stocks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Metal Exchange-approved warehouses declined 3,725 metric tons. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said most traders expected an increase of about 5,000 metric tons in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stocks because of production increases and a slowing economy. Terrorist attacks against producers in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and a state of emergency on <LOCATION> Bougainville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, site of a large copper mining operations, also have prompted worries over supplies. Copper prices were 4.10 cents to 5.35 cents higher, with July at $ 1.142 a pound. Gold and silver prices traded within a narrow range on the Comex, with prices getting a minor boost from a weaker dollar, <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> said. Gold was 90 cents to $ 1 higher with July at $ 373.40 a troy ounce; silver was .80 cent to 1.6 cents higher, with July at $ 5.202 a troy ounce. Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as rain and moderate temperatures in large areas of the growing region weighed heavily on the market. `` The favorable growing conditions for this week, with a little less warm temperatures than predicted, added to the bearish sentiment,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Disappointment in the export side of the market also affected prices.'' Wheat was 6 cents to 7 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.88 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 6 cents to 9 \ cents lower with September at $ 2.30 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 7 cents lower with September at $ 1.43 a bushel; soybeans were 12 cents to 23 \ cents lower with August at $ 6.61 -RCB- Livestock and pork futures were mixed in trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as concern over high stocks of frozen pork bellies _ the source of bacon _ weighed on meat futures. Cattle prices were affected by concern over sluggish retail beef demand. Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .23 cent higher with August at 72.60 a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .55 cent higher with August at 83.90 a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower to .13 cent higher with August at 45.85 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .15 cent lower to 1.03 cents higher with July at 28.92 a pound.

 Oil futures prices fell sharply Monday, resuming a downward pattern begun last week. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the September contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, dropped 77 cents to settle at $ 18.74 a barrel. The September contract fell 17 cents on Friday, the first trading day for that contract. The October contract lost 74 cents to $ 18.45 while subsequent months posted slightly smaller losses. Among refined products traded on the exchange, the September contract of unleaded gasoline slid 1.36 cents to 53.16 cents a gallon and heating oil for August delivery lost 1.70 cents to close at 49.59 a barrel. Contracts for gasoline and heating oil scheduled for delivery later in the year posted similar declines. Analysts said technical and other factors contributed to the market's decline. `` This weakness started coming into the market last week and we made new lows on Friday,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We expected a follow-through today.'' Reports of a possible end to the coal strike in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also impacted prices, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There is no longer a fear that the strike could spread to the oil sector of the -LRB- <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> -RRB- economy,'' <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Thrift Reports $225 Million Quarterly Loss</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Goldome bank, the thrift institution in the midst of a major restructuring under new leadership, on Monday reported a record $ 225 million second-quarter loss. <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> said changes in its investment portfolio, the sale of several business units, writedowns on non-performing assets and layoffs accounted for more than two-thirds of the loss. The rest came from continuing operations. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> president and chief operating officer, said: `` Some losses are losses and some are investments. ... These losses will actually save the company in coming quarters.'' It was the seventh consecutive quarterly loss for the company, one of the nation's largest savings and loan institutions. <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 19.5 million in the second quarter a year ago. For the second quarter this year, net interest income was $ 22 million, compared to $ 50.7 million a year ago, primarily as a result of higher interest rates, the bank said. Operating expenses were $ 178 million, compared to $ 102 million last year. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a former president of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said in April when he took over as head of <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> that he intended to turn the bank into a `` customer-driven organization.'' Goldome immediately began selling off divisions not related to the company's traditional mortgage markets and announced a plan to trim employment by 20 percent. As part of the restructuring, <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> reported the sale of $ 1.4 billion of high-risk and junk bond investments at a cost of more than $ 55 million; the reduction of $ 48 million in real estate and non-accrual loans; and layoffs and a hiring freeze that trimmed payroll costs by $ 19 million. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the moves will `` serve as a platform for our return to profitability.'' <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 14 billion in assets, operates in two dozen states.

 The plan for reducing <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign debt removes an obstacle to growth but does not guarantee recovery, economists said Monday. `` The benefits go beyond what you can see in terms of the reduction,'' said <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON>, who teaches at the <ORGANIZATION> Colegio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, a graduate school and think tank, and is a visiting fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` It generates the impression to the world and investors who want to go to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> that the financial stability is more or less there,'' she said. Economists say elements still needed for recovery are confidence, lower interest rates, investment, domestic savings, reduction of the government deficit and continued containment of wages and price. They said that, even if those conditions are met, the government must be careful not to let the economy overheat and generate more inflation. `` The agreement will let the economy grow and will gradually raise our standard of living. It does n't permit dreams. But with work, we can return to sustained growth,'' <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> told a luncheon gathering of 500 of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s elite and powerful. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> also spoke to the gathering attended by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s most powerful business, industry, media, labor and farm leaders. In his remarks, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said, `` every Mexican must now redouble his efforts'' but that those efforts can now be made with `` spirit, even happiness'' because they will result in progress. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s agreement in principle with a steering committee of 15 creditor banks was seen as a test of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration policy for reducing Third World debt and as a milestone for other debtor countries waiting to renegotiate. It represents the first significant reduction in a government's debt to commercial banks `` For the banks it is hard, but something they can live with,'' said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` This really was a big reduction of assets for the banks, and this was a big matter for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in terms of how to get on top of the debt problem.'' Under the agreement, banks have three options: a 35 percent reduction in principle, reduction of the interest rate to 6 \ percent from the current average of about 10 percent, or providing new loans equal to 25 percent of what <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> owes the bank The deal applies to about $ 54 billion of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign debt, which totals $ 107 billion, second in the developing world only to the $ 120 billion owed by <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. After more details are worked ut, which is expected to take a few weeks, the agreement will be sent to the more than 500 creditor banks for approval and choice of options. `` Is it enough so that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is in a relatively comfortable position to keep up with its payments? Definitely yes,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Macro-Asesoria </LOCATION>, an economic consulting firm. He added, however, that savings provided by the agreement were not necessarily enough to achieve President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s goal of 6 percent annual economic growth by the end of his six-year term in 1994. `` That point is still to be seen because the external debt is the first step and probably the most important one,'' but those savings alone will not be enough to finance the growth, <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had a net inflow of resources when its economy was growing, he said, but with the agreement, the country still will be sending out more foreign exchange than it gets. Officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> estimated the various options could save <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> about $ 1.5 billion annually of the $ 5 billion - $ 5.5 billion in interest on the $ 54 billion of commercial debt involved <PERSON> Rogelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> de la O., a Mexican economic consultant, said the net transfer of funds abroad would be more than 4 percent of the gross domestic product even with the agreement. The government's goal was to reduce the amount from 7 percent to 2 percent. `` I am confident the agreement is going to boost optimism in the private sector,'' he said, but added: `` The Mexican crisis is not over.'' <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran-del-Rio </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> CIEMEX-WEFA </ORGANIZATION>, an economic consulting firm in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said the biggest risk was renewed inflation, `` The greatest risk is that it may generate growing pressure on public spending, which has fallen behind, especially in government-owned industries, and for salary increases,'' he said. <PERSON> Beltran-del-Rio </PERSON> said the government wage-price plan that brought inflation down from 159.2 percent in 1987 to an anticipated 20 percent 22 percent this year still will be needed.

 <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> abandoned its $ 12.2 billion hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday after the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld a lower court decision allowing Time to proceed with its $ 14 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We find no error of law by the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION>,'' Justice <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horsey </PERSON> announced as the three-judge panel unanimously sustained a ruling by Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, thereby affirming the rights of corporate directors to decide the future course of their companies. The decision ended <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s seven-week bid to acquire Time. Paramount issued a statement that it was dropping its $ 200 a share buyout offer but would continue trying to expand through acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or partnerships. `` We believe in making bold moves when they are in the best interest of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> shareholders,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` We have just demonstrated that in our offer for Time ...'' Paramount and several of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest shareholders unsuccessfully had sought an injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, claiming that Time should be forced to consider <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s buyout offer. The tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> expired at 5 p.m. EDT and Time announced it held more than 117 million <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shares, or about 58 percent of the company's outstanding common stock. Time said it would announce Tuesday the exact number of shares tendered under its offer. Under its $ 70 a share offer, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> was to purchase slightly more than half of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock and exchange a combination of cash and securities valued at $ 70 a share for the rest. Time said shareholders would start to be paid for the tendered shares on Monday. When their merger is complete _ a process expected to take several months the new <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, will be the world's largest communications concern Paramount said it would not pursue a bid for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s ruling gave corporate directors latitude in defending against unwanted takeover bids that they claim interfere with a company's long-term strategy. The judge said the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> deal, which was announced in March, three months before <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> launched its bid, was the result of long-term business planning and that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and Time's shareholders could not interfere. Paramount has contended that once <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> announced its plan to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> it effectively placed itself up for sale and under <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law therefore had to consider <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. During more than two hours of arguments before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON> said Time's board had a fiduciary duty to inquire into <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s initial $ 175 a share buyout offer. `` We do n't question that <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> is a good deal,'' <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON> said, but he contended Time shareholders should have had a chance to vote on whether <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of the company would have been a better deal in the short term. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, an attorney for major <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, including <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, said thousands of the company's stockholders opposed the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger. He argued that based on previous <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court rulings, the board was obligated to consider <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. But Justice <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> G.T </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> interjected that <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s argument would make a board hostage `` to anyone who walked in with a bid,'' regardless of a company's long-range plans. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said after the court ruled that the decision tilted <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law in favor of management. He predicted attorneys would advise corporations to develop an `` appearance of a long-term plan'' to ward off potential takeover bids. When <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON> presented his case Monday, the justices asked why <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> _ which replaced an earlier stock-swap merger plan _ was not submitted to a vote by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders at the company's annual meeting in June. <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON> said a vote was not required because the deal did not involve the issuing of new Time stock. Furthermore, he said, after Paramount announced its bid on June 6, the market for Time stock was in disarray and the price of the shares was seesawing. `` This was hardly the situation to have an unimpassioned evaluation of future value and get a fair vote,'' he said. <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON> contended Time's plans to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would give shareholders greater value in the long term than <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 200 a share offer. The case was heard in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> because all three companies _ like many of the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations _ are incorporated there. Because so many major corporations subject to <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> laws, the Time case likely will have implications for other companies in the future. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> planned to issue a written decision at some point in the future. The justices' ruling was widely expected even before the hearing began. As arguments proceeded _ and were televised live by <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> _ Time's stock dropped on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Time stock closed down $ 1 at $ 137.50 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 1.62 -LCB- to $ 66.12 -LCB- a share and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.87 -LCB- to $ 59.37 -LCB- a share. Time stock, which traded at $ 126 a share before the Paramount bid, rose to a high of $ 182.75 before falling back in recent weeks as investors became increasingly pessimistic about the chances for Paramount's success.
