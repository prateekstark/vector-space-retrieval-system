<HEAD>Premadasa Meets With Tamil Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> and four members of his Cabinet met for the first time Thursday with Tamil rebels fighting for an independent nation and discussed ways to end the insurgency, officials said. Also Thursday, officials said <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> will help the top Sinhalese militant leader go abroad for medical treatment, a move which may pave the way for peace negotiations with the extremists. The Tamil rebellion and the resulting Sinhalese backlash have claimed more than 12,500 lives since 1983 and unleashed a wave of terror, bombings and assassinations on this once-peaceful island nation. Officials refused to reveal details of the meeting with the Tamils, which concluded for the day after a few hours. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> had received and approved a request from <PERSON> Rohana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON>, leader of the underground <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, to allow him to go abroad for medical treatment. <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON>, 46, is believed to have suffered a heart attack recently. The front is an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese group which has been at the forefront of the anti-government campaign launched in 1987 to protest peace overtures made to Tamil rebels. The request from <LOCATION> Wijeweera </LOCATION> was made through <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuttal </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> correspondent in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nuttal </PERSON> said he received two telephone calls from a front member on Thursday, who said the group would be willing to hold talks with the government if <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON> was allowed to receive medical treatment in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The request was conveyed to the government, he said. A government statement said <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> had not directly been in touch with the front. The front last month rejected <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s offer of amnesty and seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> if they gave up their campaign of assassinations and calling crippling industrial strikes. An estimated 3,500 people have been killed in the campaign. The peace offer was accepted by Tamil rebels, and a five-member team is currently holding talks with the government. Tamil insurgents launched a bloody rebellion in 1983 for an independent nation in the northern and eastern regions of the country, where most Tamils live. An attempt by <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, to end the rebellion by granting limited autonomy to the Tamils ended in failure after the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the largest rebel militia, rejected the plan after a brief acceptance. The peace plan, signed in July 1987, also sparked a backlash among nationalist Sinhalese, who said it gave too many concessions to the Tamil minority. The plan was sponsored by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping troops were later despatched to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to enforce an arms surrender by the Tamils. At least 800 Indian soldiers have been killed in hit-and-run attacks by the rebels since then. The Hindu Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the country's 16 million people, say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese majority in jobs and education. Sinhalese Buddhists make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military.

 Hundreds of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diplomatic and military families headed Thursday to temporary haven on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases to avoid possible harassment by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government. `` The problem is regime-directed gangs,'' such as the group that assaulted opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two running mates on Wednesday, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said there had been no direct threats against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel, but that in the past the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government has publicized the neighborhoods where Americans live. <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said he did not know if that was just propaganda, `` but the people around Wednesday were out of control.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> announced that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic dependents would be moved to bases after the assault on <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two vice presidential candidates Wednesday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> anounced Thursday that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is being recalled, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel would be reduced and that both military and diplomatic dependents would be moved either to safe housing or out of the country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains 10 military installations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military headquarters for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. About 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers are stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he was sending 2,000 more `` to protect the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens.'' <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said 105 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens work for the embassy, and the moving order affected 57 spouses and 85 children. The order does not affect 21,300 American civilians not connected with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, many of them retired. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said his daughters are away at college. He was planning to put up three families in his three spare bedrooms at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION>, 10 miles from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` I've been in the service, or with the service, 25 years,'' said <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON>, a civilian <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> employee. `` We take care of our own.'' The <PERSON> Kirberg </PERSON> family was one of the three <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> was expecting. They arrived at sunset, unloaded their suitcases in a few minutes and looked at their new surroundings. They said they'd had no trouble but they'd rather be safe. `` The Panamanians have always been friendly,'' said <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirberg </PERSON>, who works for <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON>. His wife, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, said she had been surprised by the call. `` It was worse last year and we never had a problem,'' she said. The <PERSON> Kirbergs </PERSON> said they put as much as they could into a few suitcases and left their dog with friends. `` I tried to take things that meant something to me,'' said <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>. That included some pillows and a small chandelier. Once inside the gate, <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> said his wife had sped out to rent some videos. `` I hope she gets some good ones,'' he said. `` I do n't know how long this is going to go on.'' The plan under which diplomatic dependents were moving Thursday was designed for temporary security, and embassy spokeswoman <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said it was not known how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decisions would affect the immediate situation. <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said: `` Everybody lives in a high-rise apartment building for security reasons. People ca n't see that you've moved, as they could if you lived in a house. `` It's not like the Joads moving from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. You just pack a suitcase for four or five days, get in your car and drive across town.'' All was calm Wednesday in one of the exclusive high-rise neighborhoods where many diplomatic families live. Almost the only vehicle moving in the hot afternoon sun was a beer truck making a restaurant delivery. Some people with pets were boarding them out, <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said, but others planned to return home during the day `` to feed pets or pick up clean underwear.'' Panamanian employees of the embassy were concerned both about harassment and whether they would have jobs if the size of the staff was reduced. `` We can do with very few Americans here and that will probably create more work, rather than less, for the Panamanians,'' the spokesman said. He said the military officials were in a more difficult situation because they had more dependents to deal with. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said there are 10,600 military dependents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, 972 of whom live off base. Southern Command was operating under condition `` Charlie,'' meaning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel can go into public areas of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> only on official business and in civilian clothes. <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said his family was in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because the current government had sent him a letter ordering him to leave the country. `` Since we do n't recognize that government, we opened the envelope, photocopied it, resealed it and stamped ` Returned Unopened' on it,'' he said. He said he sent his family home because he thought the expulsion order, and his refusal to obey it, made him a target <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies doing business in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> also should withdraw dependents. Among the larger companies with operations here are <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Colgate </ORGANIZATION>. A person who answered the telephone at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said the chamber could not express an opinion or give information because `` this is a political matter now.''

 Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sought Wednesday to dismiss the most serious charges against him as the ethics committee moved to dig deeper into a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> gas investment that yielded huge profits for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> last year. The ethics panel also denied a motion by the speaker's lawyers to bar the special outside counsel in the case, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, from holding private discussions with the committee, but granted other motions seeking access to witnesses and documents, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Committee chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., strongly defended <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> against allegations from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s camp that he has used faulty and weak reasoning in bringing charges against the speaker `` That is totally inaccurate, totally wrong and an exercise in bad judgment by the respondent's attorneys,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> told reporters. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it would undertake an independent review of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s business and political dealings if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> exonerates the speaker. `` I expect the department will take an independent look,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, chief spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, said in response to a question at a press briefing. He said such a review would cover matters brought up by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee and `` other matters that have been raised,'' such as <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s involvement in a 1985 political fund-raising effort in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` We are going to keep an eye on allegations made about the conduct of the speaker,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. But the spokesman added that `` it's premature to say we are going to have any investigation.'' Asked if the department would investigate <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> disciplined the speaker, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has a different function than the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has and we are keeping tabs on that. It would be premature to say what that's going to lead to.'' In seeking to dismiss the most serious allegations against the speaker _ that he used bulk sales of his book to evade limits on outside earned income and improperly accepted $ 145,000 in gifts from a person with a direct interest in legislation _ the lawyers charged the ethics committee is trying to hold <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to a new, tougher standard. The charges amount to `` a house of cards delicately balanced on a series of unprecedented reinterpretations of House rules,'' they argued. The eight-lawyer defense team did not immediately challenge other charges that the speaker failed to report as gifts benefits he received from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, but signaled that that issue would be contested later. On the matter of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s gas investment, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the committee, after a briefing on a series of interviews conducted last week, decided that `` there were other witnesses who would have to be interviewed'' and directed <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> to continue investigating. The investment involves a gas well in <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, near the Texas-Louisiana line, which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> bought into for $ 9,120 last January. They sold their interest less than five months later for a $ 340,000 profit, even though the well's production had dwindled. The ethics panel also generally discussed a series of other allegations against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> raised in recent news stories, but made no decisions on whether to formally expand the investigation to include those, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in its Thursday editions, reported that among the transactions that have come under scrutiny is <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s $ 100,000 investment in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> nursing home company that later went bankrupt Published reports have said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was one of the few investors in <ORGANIZATION> Jewell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> to receive payments from the company before it failed. The company's president, T.R. <PERSON> Jewell </PERSON>, is quoted in Thursday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying his company provided <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> the money to pay interest on the $ 100,000 bank loan <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> used to buy his stock in 1983 <PERSON> Jewell </PERSON> said he considered the money a `` loan'' and that similar loans were available to a few other stockholders. <PERSON> Jewell </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Star-Telegram, that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s investment had no connection with any legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and that the company gained nothing by having the powerful congressman as one of its 28 investors `` We were regulated by the state; there is n't anything he could have done to help us,'' <PERSON> Jewell </PERSON> told the Star-Telegram. Among the areas the panel is looking into is a 1985 fund-raising effort for a special congressional election in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> took an intense personal interest. In testimony last week at a federal fraud trial in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was linked to a political action committee which collected allegedly illegal contributions from officials of Commodore Savings and Loan, an insolvent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrift. On Wednesday, three former Commodore employees testified they gave money to the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> and later were reimbursed by their company, either through pay increases or checks for fictional travel. Former Commodore President <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morten </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, his brother <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, former Commodore CEO and vice chairman of the board, are being tried on charges they misused Commodore funds to make illegal PAC contributions. East Texas First raised and spent about $ 100,000 to help Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, win a special election in 1985. A former Commodore chief financial officer testified Friday that his boss told him <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had agreed to halt legislation opposed by the savings and loan industry if the industry raised $ 250,000 for the <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> denied making any such statement.

<TEXT>
 The last <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> man on the Politburo bends enough under the pressure of reform to stay in power, but <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> has not budged from his deepest convictions. He was named Ukranian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader 17 years ago to crack down on nationalism in the industrial and agricultural heartland of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And he indicates nationalism is still one of his primary concerns. `` Nationalist ideas exist everywhere, but we can not allow people who stick to such absurdities to join perestroika,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. At 71, <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> is the oldest of the 12 men on the ruling Politburo and considered one of the most conservative. Except for reformist President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself, he is the only one left dating back to the late Soviet President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>, a Ukranian, also is the only party leader of a republic <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has not replaced since becoming general secretary in 1985. Reformers complain that <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> is preventing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s changes from taking root in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, a republic with a population of 50 million. But <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> made clear in written responses to questions submitted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he feels the earth moving under his feet. `` One can see signs of renewal with the naked eye,'' he wrote. His aides said they could not recall <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> ever responding to a foreign journalist's request for an interview. The Ukrainian leader refused, however, to take any follow-up questions, either in writing or in person. Shcherbitsky is blamed by some for covering up the radiation damage done by the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant explosion, for restraining the local press and for arrests and harassment of dissidents whose political activities would be considered routine in the other European republics of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He denied the charges. `` Some groups attempt to use glasnost and the public rostrum for alien propaganda, national egoism and even anti-Sovietism,'' he said. <PERSON> Schcherbitsky </PERSON> concedes the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> is suffering from accumulated problems such as severe pollution. He said he responds to public opinion these days and, as evidence, he pointed to the scrapping of several nuclear power projects and a dam. In recent months, <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> has come under new pressures for change: <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has begun public criticism of the Ukrainian leadership, and several new reform groups have drawn thousands of people to public meetings. Six of his aides were defeated in their bids for additional positions of power in the recent election, the first in which citizens voted in large numbers against the establishment. `` I have to admit I have never run such an active and intensive election campaign,'' <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> wrote of his successful bid for a seat in the new Soviet parliament. He got 74 percent of the vote in the <LOCATION> Dnepropetrovsk </LOCATION> area, his old power base. The other 26 percent crossed his name off the ballot since there was no alternative candidate. Nine years ago, <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> smashed the <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> human rights group in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> by arresting everyone who joined. Today those activists are out of prison, and some campaigned for his defeat in the election. Some spent a few weeks in jail for their efforts. The grassroots organizations have drawn thousands of people to meetings on ecology, expanded use of the Ukrainian language, legalization of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and exposing the crimes of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Many of them, <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> said, do n't understand that `` we need time, technology and money to make changes.'' He opposes the most general reform group, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, accusing its leaders of ambition and nationalism that `` leads the way to permissiveness and national antagonism, contradicting the interests of perestroika.'' Though none of the major reform groups in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> is openly calling for independence, that is a growing source of conflict in several smaller areas of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Most recently, 20 Soviet Georgians died in unrest after troops broke up a pro-independence demonstration April 9. Ukrainian activist <PERSON> Oles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevchenko </PERSON> says <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> remains in power because <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> needs him to clamp down on nationalism in the second most populous republic and because <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> voted for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to become the Soviet leader in 1985. <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> confirmed that, `` I supported the election of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeevich </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as general secretary.'' <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> said he has no `` principal disagreements'' with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, despite `` creative discussions'' in <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> meetings. `` A lively, friendly atmosphere has replaced artificial unanimity, and that is a clear and eloquent sign of the times,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> sprinkled his comments with references to perestroika, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program. He insisted the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> is pressing ahead with farm leasing, glasnost and competitive elections, all keystones of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is more blunt in his criticism of the Ukrainian leadership's performance. In a March party meeting, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> complained that billions of rubles poured into agriculture have been wasted. A 320 percent increase in investment in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> has bought only a 39 percent rise in output in two decades, he said. But <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> denied Soviet news reports that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> party leaders to pay more attention to democratization and to work with progressive Ukrainian writers pressing for reform. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> never raised this question,'' <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> said. He did acknowledge, however, that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief `` expressed some critical remarks and offered advice, which we are considering.'' <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> refused to comment on his reputation as a conservative opponent of domestic reforms, but emphasized that changes must be carefully monitored. `` After all, perestroika is harmed by sluggishness and stomping in one place, as well as by impulsive jumps and overreactions,'' he wrote.

 The Munaymneh family and their neighbors tumbled into the underground shelter in their apartment block when a 155mm howitzer shell exploded in the street, signaling another round of fierce artillery battles in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` This is only the beginning,'' moaned <PERSON> Soumayya </PERSON> <PERSON> Munaymneh </PERSON>, 35, as she shepherded her two sons, <PERSON> Amer </PERSON>, 12, and <PERSON> Samer </PERSON>, 14, down the stairs on Tuesday. `` Will it ever stop?'' Most of the six families have spent most of the last two months cooped up in the makeshift 33-foot-by-19-foot shelter in the basement of the six-story block in the <LOCATION> Bourj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abu-Haidar </LOCATION> district of Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The fierce artillery, rocket and tank battles that have raged between army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian forces and an alliance of Syrian soldiers and Moslem Druse militiamen have reached an intensity unprecedented in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. Some days, as many as 25,000 shells and rockets are fired by both sides. Mrs. <PERSON> Munaymneh </PERSON> clutched two bottles of drinking water. Her husband, <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON>, and the boys carried chairs, blankets and mattresses. `` Do n't forget anything, because we wo n't be able to come up and get it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Munaymneh </PERSON> told the boys. Life for Christians and Moslems alike has become an endless cycle of waiting out the bombardments huddled in stuffy shelters or basement parking lots, then foraging for food and water or patching up their damaged homes and businesses during the lulls, nervously listening for the first thud of shellfire that heralds another barrage. There were 18 people in the shelter. They slipped into the routine of life underground while exploding shells and artillery guns thundered above them. The men lighted kerosene lanterns and huddled to talk politics. The women spread out mattresses in the `` sleeping corner'' and food supplies in the part of the shelter Mrs. <PERSON> Munaymneh </PERSON> called `` the dining room'' _ the area around a small cooker used to fix tea or coffee or to heat canned food. The children played cards. But everyone was tense as the explosions shook the shelter. The Munaymnehs, who are Sunni Moslems, have missed much of the recent shelling because, like thousands of other Beirutis, they fled the city. <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON> <PERSON> Munaymneh </PERSON>, a 52-year-old shipping agent, took his family to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. He brought them back to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on April 30, one day after <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> foreign ministers called for a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We thought it was over after the Arabs announced the cease-fire, and we came back because the kids' school said it was resuming classes,'' <PERSON> Munaymneh </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, it was the wrong decision,'' he said. As the shells exploded, the children argued about the caliber and direction of the rounds. `` That's an outgoing tank shell,'' <PERSON> Samer </PERSON> said when a particularly loud blast thundered above. `` I bet it's that tank on the corner.'' <PERSON> Munaymneh </PERSON> grumbled: `` That tank's inviting trouble. The Christians will start shooting at it.'' A few minutes later five arillery rounds hit the neighborhood, one near the entrance to the apartment building. `` Oh Allah, have mercy on us!'' one of the 10 women yelled. The children screamed. `` Silence! Silence!'' <PERSON> Munaymneh </PERSON> shouted. `` We're all OK. Thank God, the shell did n't damage the shelter,'' he said. His wife and some of the other women recited verses from the Koran, Islam's holy book. The whispered prayers were drowned out by a flurry of news flashes on the half-dozen transistor radios, all tuned to different Christian and Moslem stations, reporting on which districts were getting pounded by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s U.S.-made howitzers. The radios, the families' only link to the outside world, are kept on all the time. `` Is anyone talking about a new cease-fire?'' one of the women asked, her voice trembling. No one bothered to answer her. There have been dozens of cease-fires in the last two months. None lasted very long. The intensity of the barrage eased around midnight and <PERSON> Najwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Quoraitem </PERSON> ran up to her family's third-floor apartment to bring down some manakeesh _ Lebanese pizza made with thyme. `` You have to eat to survive _ that is, if the shells do n't get us,'' she murmured as she passed out the manakeesh. Another woman served tea. The barrage eased near dawn and the children fell asleep. The men took turns to go upstairs to check their apartments. `` The building next door took several direct hits,'' <PERSON> Munaymneh </PERSON> said when he came back. `` Some people were wounded. We'll find out exactly what happened later.'' At daybreak, the families left the shelter to return to their apartments. No one knew when the shelling would resume, only that it would. The Munaymnehs packed and headed back to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. Their neighbors prepared to spend another night underground.

<HEAD>Radar Balloon Damaged, Deflated by Swirling `Dust Devil'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An $ 18 million Aerostat radar balloon operated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was damaged and deflated by swirling winds Wednesday while it was moored close to the ground, officials said. The helium-filled balloon, equipped with sophisticated look-down radar as an airborne deterrent to drug-smuggling, was struck by a dust devil, a mini-cyclone or miniature tornado, around 1:30 p.m., said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, a Customs spokesman in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said there were no injuries and there was no damage to other property at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base in southeastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> where the balloon is tethered. Damages to the Aerostat have not been assessed yet. The Aerostat is 245 feet long, 72 feet in diameter and its hull is made of high-tech materials including Mylar and Tedlar. It weighs about 12,750 pounds, including the radar package of about 3,500 pounds, Customs officials have said. The Aerostat at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> was the first of a series being deployed along the U.S.-Mexico border. <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said one other Aerostat is in operation at <LOCATION> Deming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, with another scheduled to go into operation at <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>, `` hopefully next month.'' <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said the Aerostat at <LOCATION> Deming </LOCATION> has an overlapping range over the area covered by the damaged device. That, combined with military radar, Customs airborne and ground radar and air traffic control radar will make up for that on the downed balloon. Customs officials have said the balloon has been instrumental in successful tracking of several small aircraft carrying narcotics being smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. But critics have labeled the balloon a white elephant.

<TEXT>
 The army says it has driven guerrillas away from <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, ending a nine-week siege, and on Wednesday the shelling had stopped in the 16th century city of gardens built by the Moguls. Children played in open spaces bright with lilacs. Afghan soldiers advanced up to 25 miles along two fronts in an offensive begun Sunday against Moslem insurgents surrounding the city, their commanders said. `` As you can see, <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is alive,'' said Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Manok </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangall </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> and governor of <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> province. Leaders of the mujahedeen, the `` holy warriors'' who have fought for more than a decade, denied army claims of ending the siege, retaking the Samarkhel garrison and controlling half the road to the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border town of <LOCATION> Torkham </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammadi </PERSON>, defense minister of the guerrillas' exile government, told reporters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>: `` It's a total lie.. baseless propaganda The siege of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> continues. <PERSON> Samarkhel </PERSON> continues to be in the hands of mujahedeen, who also control the <LOCATION> Jalalabad-Torkham </LOCATION> road.'' President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government flew 13 Western journalists to <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> to prove it controls the strategic provincial capital 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, once known for magnificent gardens, orchards and palaces, has been under guerrilla siege since March 7. Military officials said the city, 45 miles from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, had been pounded by 131,000 rockets and artillery and mortar shells. It lies near the Khyber Pass astride the trade routes to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, dominating the entrances to the <LOCATION> Laghman </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> valleys. The modern city was built in the 16th century by <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON>, grandson of <PERSON> Babur </PERSON>, who founded the Mogul empire of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Army officials said at least 523 civilians had been killed and 3,000 wounded during the siege. They said most of the casualties occurred in the first weeks of the first major guerrilla offensive since Soviet military forces completed their withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15. Doctors at <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said nearly all the casualties were caused by rockets or shells. `` We do n't even have one patient with a bullet injury,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Hafizullah </PERSON>, director of the 260-bed hospital. Commanders of the guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978, had predicted at the onset of their offensive that <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> would fall within days. They had hoped to set up their interim government in the city as a basis for international recognition as an alternative to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> The rebels are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and receive much of their support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Reports from both sides have said <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> was in ruins, with nearly all the mud-and-brick buildings damaged or destroyed and the remaining residents hiding in ditches or basements. The scene in the dusty, rutted streets Wednesday suggested otherwise. Most buildings had been damaged by shellfire, but remained standing. Although shops generally were boarded shut, the city had electricity, running water and working telephones. Farmers worked in fields on the outskirts, harvesting their wheat and planting rice. Lilacs and wild flowers were in bloom and the city had an abundance of palm trees and small orchards. Children played in the sun and their elders moved about the city on bicycles and in horse-drawn carts, sharing the road with tanks, military jeeps and armored personnel carriers. Some neighborhoods were like ghost towns, however. More than 64,000 people lived in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> when the civil war began, but many fled to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> or to refugee camps in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. No count of how many remain is available, but some said they will never leave, despite hardship and war. `` What would we do? Where would we go? asked <PERSON> Bhargar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a 70-year-old doctor living in a Sikh temple. He said rockets had hit it five times, killing 24 people and wounding at least 100. Early in the battle for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, the army surrendered key garrisons around the city and the guerrillas came within about six miles of the airport, which was hit by thousands of rockets. The runway was damaged, a cargo building leveled and the windows of the control tower knocked out. `` If it's necessary, planes can land, but I do n't remember when the last one landed,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jehangi </PERSON>, 42, the airport commander. Military officials have not said how many soldiers have been deployed in and around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, but estimates run as high as 30,000. Nearly double that number of guerrillas were believed to surround the city at one time. When Soviet troops left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after nine years of involvement in the war, there were predictions that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s conscript army would collapse Col. Gen. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Delawar </PERSON>, army commander for the area, said of guerrilla claims of quick victory in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and the long siege that followed: `` There's an old Afghan proverb. When a man digs a well, he usually falls in.''

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> security guards have been ordered to quit slouching, get those hands out of those pockets and spit out the gum as part of a campaign to brighten their image. A memorandum from <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, reminds his officers they work under the eyes of diplomats and countless tourists and must observe proper military decorum. Among admonitions in his memorandum, obtained Wednesday: _ Smoking and chewing gum are forbidden while in uniform _ Carrying of bags, packages or other items while in uniform does not create a good image and is not permitted _ Leaning against walls or door jambs _ also out _ Guards with hands in pockets or thumbs hooked in belts look either lackadaisical or aggressive _ or both All members of the service must refrain from so doing. Regarding saluting, <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> wrote: `` There is an unacceptable lack of uniformity in this area. ... Members of the service at the rank of inspector and above will be saluted.'' Guards routinely salute Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> as their commander, but correspondents observed an outbreak of saluting since <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>'s memo began circulating on Friday.

 Hungarian television will broadcast live the reburial of <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, who was executed and interred in an unmarked grave after leading the country's 1956 anti-Soviet uprising, a newspaper reported. The remains of <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and his revolutionary associates were exhumed last month from the unmarked graves where they were buried in 1958. They are to be reburied on June 16. The plan underscores the current Communist leadership's willingness to acknowledge repressions that followed the popular uprising, which was crushed by Soviet forces The party has also shown readiness to appease public demands for broader democracy and economic reform. The independent daily <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> <PERSON> Nap </PERSON> quoted the television network's president, <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Bereczky </PERSON>, as announcing the plan for live coverage of the reburial He was also quoted as saying the network would broadcast a three-part documentary soon on events immediately after the Soviets moved to put down the uprising.

<HEAD>Ford Foundation Urges Changes In Social Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> social welfare system is out of date, has recommended comprehensive changes that include treatment on demand for drug and alcohol problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> report, entitled `` The Common Good: Social Welfare and the American Future,'' concedes that many of its recommendations face uphill political and monetary battles. The report was scheduled for release Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. Details were reported in Thursday editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The Times said the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> proposals would cost $ 29 billion beyond the $ 500 billion the federal government spends on social programs. The report recommended a tremendous expansion of the Head Start program to reach 900,000 more 3 - and 4-year-olds, and that the government pay for long-term care for the elderly The proposals would also cost the private sector an estimated $ 10 billion for employers to extend health insurance coverage for workers. The panel recommended paying for the additional programs by taxing Social Security benefits. Such a tax would raise more than half of the $ 29 billion annual cost of the recommended programs, the report said. The $ 3 million study was prepared by an 11-member panel of business, civic, labor and civil rights leaders and educators. `` We are on the right track calling attention to the country's social deficit,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, chairman of the panel and former chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> `` We know we have a hell of a fight ahead arousing people to do what needs to be done.'' One of the most ambitious proposals advocated by the panel is to provide drug and alcohol treatment `` on demand'' at an estimated $ 1 billion per year. It also called for expanding a food program, Women, Infants and Children, which now reaches half of the 6.5 million to 7.5 million people who are eligible.

 Those summer days spent soaking up the rays to create a glorious tan may come back to haunt sun worshippers with cancer and aged, wrinkled skin, a panel of experts said. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> consensus committee on Wednesday said current health studies show that suntans can lead to skin cancer, a weakened immune system and skin that wrinkles and ages before its time. Instead of uncovering to bathe in the noontime sun, the panel recommended Americans avoid the midday hours of sunlight, wear shading clothes and apply generous amounts of sunscreen lotions. Children in particular should be protected from overexposure to sunlight because skin damaged early in life is more likely to develop cancer later, the panel said in a report. `` All forms of tanning are potentially hazardous to the skin,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON>, head of the panel and chairman of the dermatology department at <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` Tanning is visible evidence of injury to the skin.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schachner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> paraphrased <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON> to note: `` Only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in midday sun. There are no healthy tans.'' <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON> said the panel recommended that: _ Everyone avoid direct exposure to sunlight, particularly during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. when the ultraviolet rays coming from the sun are the strongest _ People exposed to sunlight should wear sunscreen lotion with a rating of 15 based on protection from ultraviolet B solar radiation The panel said ultraviolet A radiation also is hazardous, though much less so, and lotions that protect against both types of UV are best. <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON> said the panel found that lotions with a protection rating of 15 `` will assure that virtually everyone would get sufficient protection from the sun'' and that there is no evidence lotions with higher ratings provide additional protection. _ Tanning parlors should be avoided `` The panel consensus is to recommend against the use of tanning parlors for cosmetic purposes,'' said <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON>. People who do use tanning parlors should wear goggles to protect their eyes and should be aware that tanning lamps can damage the skin and cause adverse reactions in people taking antibiotics, hypertensive or anti-inflammatory drugs, the panel said. _ Though some people react adversely to chemicals contained in lotion sunscreens, the panel said the `` risk-benefit ratio'' favors the use of such lotions for people who must be exposed to the sun Said Bickers: `` Individuals in the Sunbelt should use sunscreens on a daily basis.'' _ Special precautions should be taken to protect children from damaging exposures to sunlight <PERSON> Schachner </PERSON>, an expert on children's skin, said that schools and day care centers should schedule outdoor recesses to avoid midday exposure to the sun He also said that outdoor play or lunch areas should be shaded. _ Damaging exposure to sunlight, particularly early in life, can lead directly to development of two types of common skin cancer, and there is a suggestion that sunlight may play a role in development of maglignant melanoma, an unusually vicious type of skin cancer _ Though Retin-A and other vitamin A-based compounds are widely used to treat the wrinkles in sun-damaged skin, <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON> said the panel found there was insufficient scientific evidence about `` the long-term safety'' of such products A 1978 study showed that about half a million people annually develop the common forms of skin cancer, said <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON>, but reports from skin doctors indicate `` it is highly likely that there is an increasing number of cases of non-melanoma cancers.'' He said chemicals are thought to be eroding the ozone layer of the stratosphere, thus allowing more ultraviolet radiation to reach the Earth's surface. And <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON> said the panel's research showed there are about 20,000 tanning salons in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> which are visited by an estimated one million customers. Both of these factors, he said, may be leading to increasing cases of skin cancers. The panel released the recommendations after reviewing studies and hearing testimony over a three-day period. The panel included 14 skin and cancer experts from nine states.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A coalition aimed at improving the quality of science, math and technology education today recommended President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> form a White House task force on those subjects to develop a national policy. The non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> also said the federal government should spend an extra $ 304 million in fiscal 1990, rising to $ 465 million in 1993, to promote elementary science, math and technology education improvements. The proposed presidential task force would develop a national policy, coordinate federal programs and plan a White House conference on `` Science, <ORGANIZATION> Mathematics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> for the year 2000.'' `` We have made a special effort to emphasize programs that do not require significant new funds,'' said the report released by the coalition of 80 business, labor, science and education groups. `` However, the very magnitude of the challenge the nation faces will call for some new programs and new resources.'' The action plan, designed to help <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president develop a national policy on science education, states that `` increased investments in elementary education must be the nation's number one priority.'' Specifically, it suggests that the government start a $ 50 million grant program to help elementary schools pay for new science equipment and earmark another $ 50 million to encourage innovative approaches to science teaching. The group would also give the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> an extra $ 50 million to expand its in-service and pre-service training programs for elementary teachers. Other recommendations would require less money or none at all. Among them: _ Revamp the science curriculum to tailor it to students of different ages, interests and backgrounds, a project that should be led by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> _ Increase federal support for graduate training in the sciences and engineering, with special support to women and minorities _ Give clear instructions to schools receiving money under federal school improvement programs, totaling more than $ 1 billion a year, that their first priority must be science, math and technology education activities _ Reserve 5 percent of the nearly $ 9 billion the federal government spends on student loans, grants and scholarships for special programs aimed at attracting and retaining math, science and technology teachers at all academic levels _ Establish new federal incentives to encourage better teacher training _ Implement more stringent state requirements for science teachers _ Offer salary incentives for excellence in science and math teaching and strengthened continuing education requirements in the science area for elementary and secondary teachers The Triangle proposals are a follow-up to an earlier report that called for a sharply focused science education strategy. The group is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Organizations represented by its officers include the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, E.I. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Acoustical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and various universities and state education groups.

 Grumpy the traveling lawn dwarf is back where he belongs, concrete feet planted firmly on the porch, following his whirlwind tour of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and elsewhere. He even has pictures from his vacation. The 20-inch, 80-pound concrete statue of the character in the Walt Disney movie classic `` Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' disappeared March 16 from <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>'s front porch. `` I could n't set my finger on it, but I felt something was missing,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said. `` The next morning my daughter said, ` Mom, there's somebody missing.''' Bashful, <PERSON> Doc </PERSON>, Sneezy, Happy, Sleepy, Dopey and the 400-pound Snow White were safe and sound but Grumpy was gone. On April 26, a freshly scrubbed <PERSON> Grumpy </PERSON> returned, with a sign dangling from his shoulders that said `` I'm home.'' Along with the sign was an envelope with 35 photographs from his journey, many of them with captions on the back. Among the photos were snapshots of Grumpy ogling bikini-clad women from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> sand dune, standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and dining at <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. `` My husband and I, we were laughing so hard at these pictures.

Mrs. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said <PERSON> Grumpy </PERSON> has vanished before, turning up once in front of an ice cream store and in the back seat of a restaurant manager's car. `` She saw somebody looking over her shoulder and started screaming. He was just standing there with his arms folded and that snarl on his face,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said. She said neither she nor the police had any idea who took Grumpy. She theorizes that `` it's someone with an engineering background. The printing on the back of the pictures is very similar to the type you see on blueprints.'' This year's vacation could be Grumpy's last. Mrs. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said she planned on having all the dwarfs cemented in place. Nevertheless, she admits to envying Grumpy's wandering ways. `` He gets to go everywhere. I never get to go anywhere.''

<HEAD>Exercise Keeps President in ``Excellent Health''</HEAD>

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been declared in sound health and advised to keep up the exercise regimen his physician says helps keep him fit. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emerged from <ORGANIZATION> Bethesda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday with an adhesive bandage on a finger, he was pronounced in `` excellent health'' by his personal physician, Dr. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, after his first full-scale medical checkup as chief executive. The bandage covered a cyst that was treated, and which <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said is not a medical problem. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is in extremely sound physical condition,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said in a statement issued by the White House. `` He keeps fit through a number of physical activities, which we recommend he continue on a regular basis.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> led a team of physicians _ including an ophthalmologist, a urologist, a dermatologist and two allergists _ that conducted the three-hour examination. The statement said a `` sebaceous cyst'' on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s middle right finger was drained. `` The president is wearing a Band-Aid on the finger, which he can remove within the next few hours,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` This cyst has been present for many years and does not present a medical problem.'' A sebaceous cyst is a benign growth on the skin that is often removed surgically. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is an avid jogger, plays tennis, pitches horseshoes, occasionally swims and uses a stationary bicycle and indoor treadmill. The White House statement said a chest X-ray, an electrocardiogram, blood samples and a urinalysis all showed normal results. Other X-rays showed mild degenerative arthritis of the hip. That condition `` has been present for several years,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said the arthritis has forced him in recent years to cut down on his jogging. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes medication because of a severe allergy to bee stings and to control hay fever. Wednesday's medical statement said `` allergy tests showed excellent protective antibody levels.'' The White House did not make immediately available statistics from the examination, such as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cholesterol count and blood pressure. However, deputy press secretary <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said some additional data might be released later. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said Wednesday's examination showed no major changes from the results of last year's tests, which showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cholesterol count at 192, considered in the desirable range by the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. His blood pressure then was a normal 108 @ 84. More complete information was released from the May 1988 test, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a presidential candidate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself displayed his pleasure with the results of the physical by grinning and flashing giving a double thumbs-up sign when asked how he felt as he arrived at the White House from the hospital.

<HEAD>Agency Study Enlivens Debate Over Steel Import Quotas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> study helps document the claim by a manufacturers' group that steel import quotas have harmed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, the group says. The <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> said in a report Wednesday that steel import restraints have reduced American export sales by raising steel prices. The 96-page report by the independent government agency was certain to enliven the debate over whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> should continue steel quota agreements with 19 nations and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration negotiated five-year, product-by-product voluntary restraint agreements, or `` VRAs,'' in 1984 with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and other nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has pledged to continue the restraints in some form beyond their Sept. 30 expiration date. But with the steel industry newly profitable, opponents of the curbs believe they can make a case for ending the program, or at least narrowing its scope. The <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> said in the report that the curbs caused steel prices in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to rise by as much as 0.6 percent in 1985, 1.6 percent in 1986, 1.4 percent in 1987 and 0.2 percent in 1988. It said the weakening of the dollar overseas and other factors also contributed significantly to further price hikes. As a result of the VRA-induced price increases, the commission estimated American exports in steel-consuming industries decreased by $ 258 million in 1985, $ 673 million in 1986, $ 699 million in 1987 and $ 95 million in 1988. `` It makes no sense to renew a program that causes such harm to American competitiveness,'' particularly when the steel industry is healthy, said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON>, spokesman for a coalition of more than 300 manufacturers opposed to the import curbs' extension. Applauding the report's conclusions, <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON> said American manufacturers have been `` hamstrung'' by higher steel prices. The report said recent steel price hikes `` have been distributed unevenly among categories of customers.'' Price increases were not as great for large steel purchasers as for small ones, apparently because the larger purchasers buy a great deal of their steel through long-term contracts with prices set in advance, the <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> said. The question of whether the restraints have caused steel price increases has divided American manufacturers. Last month, a coalition of 374 manufacturers led by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and others was formed to lobby for continuing the quota agreements on grounds that the curbs have helped make the steel industry healthier. That coalition contends steel price increases have been caused by strong worldwide demand and shifting exchange rates. The <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> cautioned the figures reflected an `` upward bias'' because of the procedures it used. That means the effect of the import restraints on prices might have been overstated. The study was conducted at the request of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces are quietly forging ahead with plans to phase out their bases along the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, despite threats in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military intervention following this week's allegedly fraudulent election. `` In all this hubbub we are doing our job,'' Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said Wednesday. The 10,000 or so troops and the 14,000 dependents, however, were put on a heightened alert, urging them to `` stay close to home'' following violent demonstrations in downtown <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, deputy public affairs director for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, described the measure as a `` precaution,'' adding: `` It's business as usual as far as the units go.'' The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel are based at 10 military installations along the 50-mile long <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION>, which cuts a swath through the isthmus to join the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> oceans. Their mission mandated by the 1977 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Treaties is twofold: to protect the waterway but to prepare to turn that job over to the Panamanians on Dec. 31, 1999. A so-called neutrality treaty, however, provides an open-ended American military presence to guarantee the `` permanent neutrality and operation'' of the canal. Alleged election fraud by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, sparked new waves of internal discontent and renewed speculation at home the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would send in military reinforcements. Some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have suggested outright intervention to topple <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration sources have described that as unlikely. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, asked about possible plans to send added <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops, said: `` I ca n't speak with regard to future military activities.'' But a military source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said: `` As I understand it, that is not being given serious consideration.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not recognized <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government since last year, shortly after he was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges. American military personnel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for the past year have been the targets of harassment, reportedly by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s Defense Forces troops. On Wednesday, for example, five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel were detained. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> frequently accuses the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of attempting to renege on turning over the canal and on getting the troops out. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, however, is making plans to move the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which manages American military operations south of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The tropical, white-washed buildings will be transferred to the Panamanians no later than the end of the century. `` There's nothing to preclude a move before then,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. Seven sites for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> have been announced and a decision could come by the end of July, the spokeswoman said. Under consideration are <ORGANIZATION> MacDill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>,; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Leesville </LOCATION>, La,; <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, La,; the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and Fort <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>, both in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. American troops have been based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since shortly after the nation's independence from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in 1903, peaking during World War II when some 67,000 military personnel were there. Despite its stated mission to protect the canal, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military has used <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to garner intelligence on the Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the leftist guerrillas fighting in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. When the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties went into effect on Oct. 1, 1979, the American military began turning over its territory and property. Bases turned over the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> so far include <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Albrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION>, both near <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, more than 125 military homes in the former Canal Zone, and <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulick </PERSON>, home of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s School of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> for 35 years, which became a training school for the Panamanians. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> control, the school trained some 44,000 Latin American military personnel and was widely called `` the school of the dictators.'' The School of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> today operates at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benning </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The remaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> includes the Jungle Operations Training Center at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, a Special Forces battalion, a military intelligence battalion, an infantry brigade, <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and Naval operations.

 Immigration reforms have created a `` vulnerable underclass living in the shadows of our communities,'' immigration rights activists told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel.

But witnesses told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on immigration, refugees and international law the law has left many harshly exploited and with nowhere to turn. `` As the undocumented are forced further underground, the immigration law is creating everything it was supposed to eliminate _ a vulnerable underclass, living in the shadows of our communities, facing increased poverty and exploitation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Heiberger </PERSON> testified. Unscrupulous employers `` often exploit undocumented workers fearful of reporting subminimum wages, sexual harassment and unsafe working conditions,'' she said. <PERSON> Muzaffar </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chishti </PERSON>, director of the Immigration Project for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the law has had a deep impact on the so-called `` sweatshop sector.'' Employers are `` finding it easier to exploit these workers and further depress wages and working conditions,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> countered that those who do n't qualify for amnesty do not have to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> said the law was not intended `` to benefit the most recent arrivals. ... The law is doing what it intended to do'' by keeping undocumented aliens out of the work force. <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raza </ORGANIZATION> testified that spouses and children of legalized family members have had deportation proceedings initiated against them in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and elsewhere. <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> called that charge `` ridiculous.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> nullified the election late Wednesday after paramilitary forces beat the opposition presidential and vice presidential candidates with pipes and baseball bats as soldiers stood by. Both sides had claimed victory in Sunday's balloting, which international observers and the opposition claimed were rigged by forces loyal to strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who heads the 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. `` The elections of May 7, 1989, are declared annulled in their entirety,'' <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulice </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>, said in a nationwide broadcast. `` Constant vote stealing at the polls, vote buying, and missing tally sheets made proclamation -LRB- of a new president -RRB- impossible.'' She said the outcome of the elections was `` altered by the obstructionist action by the many foreigners called in by foreign or domestic political forces without invitation.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for more than a year and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, charging that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s forces planned to fix the elections, had sent an uninvited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> condemned the attack on the candidates and said dependents of the 12,000 military and diplomatic personnel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> who live off-base would be moving to military bases Thursday. `` By this action <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has demonstrated his contempt for the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people,'' he said. After the election was declared null, the city went quiet as truckloads of soldiers moved into the streets. The soldiers searched any vehicle that moved as the trucks dropped squads off throughout the city. Calls to opposition leaders found none at home. The government meanwhile said nothing about rescheduling the election. While the White House and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said, `` It makes it worse.'' `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has closed out his options,'' he added. Earlier Wednesday, supporters of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader since 1983, beat opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two running mates with iron bars and bats as he led protesters alleging electoral fraud. Soldiers made no attempt to intervene during the attack, in which <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> suffered a gash in the head that required eight stitches. Officials said one of <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s bodyguards was killed and four soldiers were wounded in a gunfight. Witnesses said some of the candidates' bodyguards leaped out of cars and fired at the attackers. Later Wednesday, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was taken from his campaign headquarters on a stretcher after a second attack. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> `` had difficulty walking and his speech was slurred. His doctor said the left side of his body was partly paralyzed.'' <LOCATION> Paitilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> early Thursday denied <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was being treated there. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s two vice-presidential candidates, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, were bloodied but not injured as seriously. News reports said scores of others were injured. The three candidates were leading a motorcade through the capital when they were attacked by civilians wearing red `` Dignity Battalion'' T-shirts and wielding an assortment of sticks, bats, pipes and rubber whips. Armed civilian <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters, often members of paramilitary `` Dignity Battalions,'' have frequently taken part in breaking up opposition demonstrations. `` They beat me in the head with an iron bar,'' said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> in a brief hospital interview. `` I saw <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> on the ground with me,'' he said, referring to his first vice presidential candidate. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> had been arrested and taken to an undetermined location. The incident took place at a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> blockade, and opposition bodyguards shot four soldiers, said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yueng </PERSON>. He said a second lieutenant was critically injured. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said one of <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s bodyguards was killed. It was the first time soldiers suffered gunshot wounds since <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> came to power in this nation of 2.2 million. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, sitting in a wheelchair, displayed the stitches doctors put in the top of his head. `` I blame <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for everything bad that has happened in the Republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. I hope he leaves soon,'' he said. Angry crowds broke windows and burned at least six cars in the downtown area. Police broke up scattered groups of demonstrators with tear gas and gunshots fired in the air. The motorcade was part of an opposition campaign to gain international support and prevent an official victory proclamation in favor of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s hand-picked candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> was ahead by a 2-1 ratio in the secretive official count of the estimated 800,000 votes cast Sunday. More than 300 observers, including Europeans, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation as well as former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, called the election fraudulent and said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> actually won by a 3-to-1 margin. The TV announcer repeated government accusations that the opposition is trying to help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abrogate the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, under which <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> gains control of the canal on Dec. 31, 1999. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> had told its personnel to stay out of public places unless on official business, and then to appear only in civilian clothes. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said five members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces were detained, three of them reservists who were quickly released. He said he expected the other two to be released shortly and that they were being treated well. U.S.-Panama relations have been poor since <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> orchestrated President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster in February 1988, and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> reportedly contributed $ 10 million to the opposition campaign. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was replaced by the acting president, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire the general after he was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-smuggling and money-laundering charges, but the Noriega-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> removed him from office. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claims the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges are a smokescreen to keep the canal.

<HEAD>Study Links Common Painkiller with Kidney Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some doctors are warning that long-term, daily use of a common aspirin substitute may triple the usual risk of kidney damage, but the maker of Tylenol disputed the finding. `` I do n't want people to panic and say, ` My kids should n't have Tylenol,''' said Dr. <PERSON> Saulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Klahr </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` But at the same time, it's important for people not to take this drug daily.'' <PERSON> Klahr </PERSON> said acetaminophen, the main ingredient in Tylenol, Anacin-3, <PERSON> Datril </PERSON> and other brands, may accumulate in the kidneys and cause chemical damage. A related painkiller, called phenacetin, was taken off the market six years ago because of concern about kidney damage and bladder cancer. Some experts also have worried that prolonged daily use of ibuprofen, another common painkiller, may harm the kidneys. The drug was released for non-prescription sales in 1985 and was not included in the study of acetaminophen. The study, published in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, found no sign that aspirin is bad for the kidneys. However, it can cause stomach irritation and bleeding and perhaps a rare childhood disorder called <PERSON> Reye </PERSON>'s syndrome. The new research found that acetaminophen is safe when used occasionally. And while it raises the possibility that overuse harms the kidneys, it does not prove this. `` Acetaminophen is not necessarily risk free,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>, who directed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> study. `` This study does not demonstrate any effect for acetaminophen when taken as directed, which is when needed for symptoms, but when symptoms persist, you should seek medical advice.'' In a Journal editorial, Drs. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBroe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antwerp </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> cautioned that `` this finding should be considered tentative until it is confirmed by other studies.'' Dr. <PERSON> Vardamen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckalew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bowman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, a co-author of the study, commented: `` I would be swayed toward believing there is a cause and effect relationship between heavy acetaminophen ingestion and renal -LRB- kidney -RRB- disease. But I would agree with anyone who says we need to do more work.'' The study compared 554 people in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> who had newly diagnosed kidney disease with 516 randomly chosen adults. It found the people who took the medicine daily for an extended period had three times the risk of kidney disease than occasional users. Acetaminophen accounts for 37 percent of the nation's $ 2.5 billion annual over-the-counter sales of pain pills, according to the consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> Kline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Aspirin represents about 43 percent and ibuprofen 20 percent According to <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, 71 percent of the acetaminophen sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is Tylenol, which is made by <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. A spokesman for the company said the study was flawed, in part because it often relied on relatives of kidney patients to determine their use of acetaminophen and other painkillers. `` The study in question provides no basis to suggest that the use of acetaminophen is associated with kidney disease,'' spokesman <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said in a statement. At <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, which makes Anacin-3, spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerling </PERSON> said, `` The article says it deserves further scrutiny from the scientific community, and we will be interested in following the results of that further scrutiny.'' High blood pressure and diabetes are major underlying causes of kidney disease. <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said that even if acetaminophen does prove harmful, it is probably less significant than those causes. `` How much kidney disease is explained by this?'' <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said. `` A small but not inconsequential amount. The importance is knowing that there is a risk that is preventable, whereas there is not much we can do about kidney disease associated with diabetes.''

 A man who rented a house to an unmarried couple and then changed his mind because he believed they were not showing respect for Christian values is getting support from across the country. `` I just could n't allow that type of activity to go on in our house,'' said carpenter Layle French, 33, who reneged on an agreement that would have allowed <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON> and her fiance to move into a house he was trying to sell. A <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> administrative law judge ruled in March that French violated a law that prohibits discrimination based on marital status. He said the only unsettled issue is how much French should pay in damages. French, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, contends the law should take a back seat to his Christian values. Aside from that, he maintains that couples who live together violate the state's fornication law. `` We go back to a very scary time if we say landlords get to pick the religion of tenants,'' said state Human Rights Commissioner <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. Although there is some support for the 27-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON>, most of this politically conservative town of 10,000 residents seem to back French. `` If people want to live together that's their business, but then they should rent from someone who does n't care,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cool </PERSON>, who owns an office supply store. `` I look at the case as a morality case,'' said <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON>, another businessman in this town 150 miles west of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` Layle in essence would be responsible for what goes on in that place.'' `` It's really a paradox,'' said attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who organized a non-profit corporation that has raised about $ 1,300 for French's appeal. `` The state is coming after Layle for upholding a statute.'' About 200 people attended a rally for French last month, and petitions and letters of encouragement have streamed in from around the country, including one from a group of about 40 Orthodox Jews in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. About 300 people have made $ 1 contributions to <LOCATION> French </LOCATION>'s legal fund, he said. `` As the matter works its way through the courts I think we're going to prevail,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said French agreed on Feb. 22, 1988, to rent to <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON>, who told him what her living arrangements would be. French changed his mind two days later and paid a refund. `` I did n't feel good about it but I initially took the money anyway,'' French said. `` My biggest, toughest thing was to go back on my word.'' Not knowing that <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON> complained to the state <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, French said he forgot the transaction until the department wrote him in May 1988, requesting an unspecified amount of money to pay for <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON>'s damages. `` To me it was like they were asking for a payoff,'' French said. <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON>, who has since married her fiance, said she is proud of the state and angry that <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> is publicizing the case as a moral quandary. `` What Mr. French did was against the law,'' she said. `` He broke a contract. This is n't about religion.''

<TEXT>
 The key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose moderately on Thursday, and the dollar rebounded against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 39.52 points the previous day, recouped 89.14 points, or 0.26 percent, to finish at 34,081.49. The dollar ended trading at 134.55 yen, up 0.11 yen from Wednesday's close of 134.44 yen. Opening lower at 134.18 yen, the currency rose while moving between 134.17 yen and 134.60 yen. Traders said the dollar's lower opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed its similar downtrend on overseas markets. Japanese market players were inclined to make technical adjustments without making major moves, said a trader with a commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, who declined to be named. The scheduled release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer price index Friday also prompted the market's wait-and-see mood, the trader added. Other traders said the yen would not continue to rise further because of the market's fundamental demand for the dollar. On the stock exchange, dealers said the Nikkei average, which rose moderately after a slight gain in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, did not rise further as market players stepped off to the sidelines later. <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> said trading became thin in the absence of market-affecting incentives. `` Participants' buying interest was still strong after consecutive gains last week, but they could n't determine a direction of trading,'' he said. Sellings for profit-taking also resulted in the index's small gain Thursday, <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>International Writers' Group Accepts Russian, Lithuanian Chapters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MAASTRICHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sixty-five years after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> first tried to gain membership, the <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> international writers' association has accepted a Russian and a Lithuanian chapter. Members of the 10,000-strong PEN, whose charter speaks out strongly against censorship, voted unanimously Wednesday to admit the two groups. `` We have at last obtained something we have been fighting for for decades ... the great Russian literature with its great traditions ... is finally among us,'' said the group's international secretary, <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> Blokh </PERSON> The association also criticized <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and seven other nations for imprisoning literary figures and journalists, including a founder of the Charter 77 Czechoslovak human rights group, playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>. Soviet participation has been an issue ever since PEN _ Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists and Novelists _ turned down an application by the Soviet state in 1924, three years after <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> was founded. PEN had kept out the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of its persecution of writers and other intellectuals, and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had regarded the authors' group as anti-communist. The approval of the two chapters in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> clears the way for the opening of up to four more PEN chapters there, including <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> and Estonian chapters operating in exile, said <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION>'s outgoing chairman, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. In a speech made before the vote, Soviet novelist <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON> told delegates that `` all worthy writers can become members of our PEN center, including those living outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' `` We want our country to have its literature, regardless of the writer's place of residence, regardless of his beliefs and ideas,'' <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON> said. `` Thirty years of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s tyranny, 20 years of -LRB- <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s incompetent rule is long enough to ruin any society, particularly a society that has no democratic traditions,'' <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON> said. PEN leadership and Soviet authorities agreed the new chapter would operate independently of the official Soviet Writers' Union. Soviet poet <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitov </PERSON> conceded `` there ca n't be any guarantee'' that the Soviet PEN chapters wo n't be suppressed or taken over by authorities. But <PERSON> Bitov </PERSON> added: `` There's a kind of belief that everything's been going in a progressive way,'' referring to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or increased openness, which has been credited for more freedom in intellectual pursuits PEN criticized <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> for jailing at least 24 dissident intellectuals and banning two novels, including <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s `` Tropic of Capricorn. PEN also called on <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to release <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, who in February was sentenced to nine months in prison. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> had been involved in a demonstration to commemorate the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of his country.

<HEAD>Bomb Plant's Medical Director Was A Veterinarian, Union Complains</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Union leaders representing workers at an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> uranium-processing plant complained to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that an animal doctor, rather than a people doctor, led an important medical division at the government-owned plant. Until recently, a veterinarian was the manager of medical services at the Feed Materials Production Center near <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the labor leaders told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. `` To me it is an obvious example of the casual attitude the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and their contractors took when dealing with the health and very lives of the men and women who worked at these facilities,'' said <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Chatak </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s industrial union department. A plant spokesman confirmed that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, who holds a degree in veterinary medicine, held the job until April 13. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> holds several other degrees, including a bachelor's degree in health sciences with minors in chemistry and mathematics and a master's degree in pathology, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the plant's operator, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> Materials of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> did not `` perform medical evaluations,'' was not considered the supervisor of the three physicians who work at the plant on a subcontract basis, and `` has not been a practicing veterinarian at all since his affiliation with <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>.'' The medical services job involves overseeing medical records and technologists, <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. A new administrator has not yet been named, he added. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> was moved to another department as part of major reorganization in which many department heads were changed, the spokesman said. The Fernald plant, about 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, processes uranium for use in nuclear weapons or as fuel for reactors. The plant is the subject of a $ 300 million lawsuit on behalf of 14,000 people who live or work nearby and believe their health has been threatened by radioactive discharges into the air and water. The government has admitted ignoring or undermining efforts to reduce pollution there. The government has estimated that as much as 552,000 pounds of radioactive uranium dust may have escaped into the air from the plant. Workers have been complaining they were n't adequately protected from or told about the dangerous substances. Most of those complaints have been directed against the plant's former operator, <ORGANIZATION> NLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which ran the plant until 1985. `` It seems to me that what we have at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> is a work force that has been excessively exposed to radioactive and other toxic materials over an extended period of time,'' Chatak testified. `` For at least the last few years they relied on a medical program that was directed by a veterinarian and they were studied by DOE researchers whom they did not trust and could not believe,'' he said.

 Fire killed about 500,000 research mice at the <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, and the loss will set back scientists around the world who depend on its purebred strains, officials said. Four construction workers who were remodeling the building where the blaze broke out Wednesday afternoon were hospitalized, and at least two firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation, officials said. `` We managed to save what are called the foundation stocks ... the original genetically defined strains'' of mice, said Director-designate <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Paigen </PERSON>. `` It will take us time but we will be able to reproduce what was there.'' <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> director, said it would take six to eight generations of mice, or about two or three years, to replace the animals. It was unclear what effect on research the short-term mouse shortage could have. With an annual budget of $ 27 million, the lab produces between 2 million and 3 million mice a year and provides them to scientists throughout the country, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Its major customers include mammalian genetics researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, as well as major hospital research centers, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevett </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spokeswoman. During years of breeding, the lab has produced 1,700 strains of mice by genetic accident. The mice carry odd physical traits, some caused by mutant genes. Studying those genes can provide clues to human disorders, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer and AIDS. Sales of the mice generate $ 10 million a year, which is put back into research and other programs at the laboratory, <PERSON> Trevett </PERSON> said. The fire would not delay <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>'s research because mice used in its own experiments already had been transferred to a different building, <PERSON> Paigen </PERSON> said. But he said he was concerned about preserving the jobs of 230 of the more than 500 employees of the laboratory, the major employer in the town of about 2,400 people. `` It's going to be a hard blow to the town's economy,'' said Fire Chief <PERSON> Royal </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. The fire destroyed a block-long one-story brick and metal building; 27 other lab buildings were untouched. The cause of the fire was under investigation. A sealant used by the construction workers apparently helped spread the flames, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said. The four injured construction workers were listed as stable, said <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulong </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The most seriously burned worker was transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s burn unit in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, she said Jackson Lab, which was founded in 1929, was destroyed in a 1947 forest fire that swept across <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. After it was rebuilt, the lab grew rapidly to become the world's largest center for the study of mammalian genetics.

<TEXT>
 A major liberal organization is gearing up for a full-dress lobbying campaign to challenge the nomination of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights chief. `` We made a commitment to oppose and we wo n't go into it halfheartedly,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>, president of People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` It is the most important civil rights position in the government and we believe <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is n't qualified for that top position,'' he said. The group, along with the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella coalition of 180 organizations, and the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced this week it would join the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> in opposing <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>. These civil rights organizations contend that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a black Republican who ran unsuccessfully for governor of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1986, lacks the necessary experience to be assistant attorney general for civil rights. <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON> said his organization must `` figure out how to get our case out to the American public'' and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> who will ultimately vote on <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' nomination. No date has been set for <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' confirmation hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON> would not rule out an advertising campaign similar to one the group waged in 1987 to help defeat <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s nomination to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Despite mounting opposition among civil rights groups, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, a top aide to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, predicted that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> would not encounter serious opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The nomination has split the civil rights movement, with such prominent figures as <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, supporting <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> sheriff and chief executive of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, is also backed by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., and the Detroit chapter of the Urban League <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON> acknowledged that the split will make the fight more difficult. `` Certainly <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> brings a lot of prestige, symbolic validation, we'll need to deal with it,'' <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON> said. `` It is not something anyone feels comfortable with.'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a former Democrat, became a Republican the year before his unsuccessful gubernatorial bid. He opposes racial quotas but generally supports affirmative action. Besides his lack of experience in civil rights, opponents cite <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' record as sheriff of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. A panel of state judges once cited <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> for contempt of a court order to reduce overcrowding and improve conditions at the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. A federal appeals court also criticized <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> for failing to investigate allegations of brutality against several deputies. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> has said jail conditions were out of his control because of a fiscal crisis in local government and he only learned of the brutality charges years later. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> `` has a very impressive record of achievement in the civil rights area. `` When he became sheriff of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> less than 1 percent of the detective force was black. After 12 years as sheriff that had increased to 20 percent of the detective force. `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' experience is not significantly less than other people,'' said <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, who noted that other civil rights chiefs `` did not have significant litigating experience in civil rights.'' He called <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> a conciliator whose approach to civil rights issues was well suited to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's policies. `` Our intention is to try to move forward on contentious civil rights issues in a constructive way and not get involved in contentious legal disputes that might only delay the providing of civil rights,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bush Administration to Urge Protection of African Elephant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says it plans to come to the rescue of the African elephant, whose numbers are being threatened by ivory hunters. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said Wednesday he has told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives to an international conference next October to push for increased protection of the elephant. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the meeting will urge that the African elephant be placed in a more protected classification under the international endangered species treaty, thereby prohibiting any of the 101 treaty nations from engaging in the commercial trading of ivory. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision met immediate praise from several conservation and animal protection organizations which have for some time wanted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to take a more direct interest in protecting the African elephant. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is by far the most influential member to come out in favor of the proposal. This should carry a lot of weight,'' said <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Feral </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION>, which earlier this year petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to take action to protect the elephant. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, associate director of wildlife and environment for the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leadership in ending the worldwide ivory trade `` is critical'' to protecting the African elephant. `` No trinket is worth the death of an elephant and the extinction of a species,'' she said. Since 1978, the number of African elephants found in 34 countries has declined from 1.5 million to as few as 400,000, according to the government and private groups. The number continues to decline at a rate of 8 percent a year, largely at the hands of ivory-seeking poachers, they say. Last year the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imported $ 32 million worth of ivory, most of which originated with the African elephant. `` I am deeply concerned about the future of the African elephant,'' said <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> in a statement announcing that the department also is considering changing the African elephant's classification from `` threatened'' to `` endangered'' under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> endangered species law He told department officials to come up with a recommendation. Conservationists believe the action by the 101 nations that belong to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species to place the African elephant on a more restrictive list would severely cut into the international ivory trade. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said officials of the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will urge action by the 101 nations at the October meeting. A two-thirds vote is needed for the elephant to be reclassified.

 Dissident groups charged today that a radical student was tortured and killed by police interrogators and they called for peaceful protests to demand the fall of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government. About 5,000 students rallied today at <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> to denounce police for the death of <PERSON> Chol-kyu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the South Korean news agency. Some cut their fingers and wrote anti-government slogans in blood. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a 24-year-old student at <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION>, had served almost two years in jail for violating national security laws and was being sought by police for writing articles praising communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. His body was found Wednesday in a reservoir near <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the main dissident alliance, alleged <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was tortured and killed by police investigators assigned to suppressing dissident groups. Dissidents and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s family claimed the body showed signs of electric torture and beatings. Police denied involvement in <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s death and officials said leftists may have killed the student as part of an attempt to cover up anti-government activities. An initial autopsy showed no signs of torture, but it appeared <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was slain, they said. Dissident groups charged that a special police unit, the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, set up earlier this year to suppress violent anti-government groups, may have been involved in <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s death. The unit had announced Wednesday it arrested 234 dissidents since April 3 for anti-government activity. The discovery of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s body came after six riot troopers were killed May 3 in a clash with radical students in the southern port of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>. The government ordered a major crackdown on violent dissidents after the troopers were killed. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been hit by a wave of violent anti-government protests and labor strikes in recent months. Police have rounded up dozens of suspects as part of efforts to crush dissident groups. The National Student Council, the main alliance of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s radical students, charged that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was tortured and it demanded that police officers involved be arrested and punished `` We will fight to the end if there is any attempt to cover up or fabricate the truth,'' said council head <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chong-suk </PERSON>. Thousands of riot police were on alert for demonstrations Friday in the central city of <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> on Saturday to mark the anniversary next week of a 1980 anti-government uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> in which at least 192 people were killed. Some dissident and radical student groups have said they will stop violent protests because of the deaths of the riot troopers in <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s death could provoke new unrest, especially if police attempt to block protests. Radical students and the anti-government dissident groups have little support because of their violent tactics and extreme political views. The radicals have been calling for the overthrow of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and the creation of a leftist state ruled by workers and farmers. The government has warned that efforts by radicals to build an alliance with workers threatens stability. Strikes have cost the economy almost $ 4 billion in lost production so far this year, officials say.

<HEAD>FBI Believes Iran Planted Flight 103 Bomb But Can't Indict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> does n't have enough evidence to seek an indictment despite the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusion that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was responsible for last year's bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. A <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> assessment of the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing has concluded that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hired a Syrian-based Palestinian organization to carry out the operation, sources told The Post. The sources also said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the possibility that one of two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> college students who had <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> boyfriends may have been the unsuspecting courier who carried the bomb onto the flight. The explosion over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killed 270 people. The flight had originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and stopped in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> before heading to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> is confident of its conclusions blaming <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> does n't believe sufficient evidence exists to seek indictments against the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said. The organization is headed by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, who with his senior aides met at least once last fall with Iranian officials in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. Published reports previously have linked <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s organization to the bombing. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> has denied that his organization planted the bomb but acknowledged in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> interview broadcast last Friday that his group routinely used the same kind of explosive device that investigators say blew up the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s first lieutenant, <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalkamoni </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Jabril </PERSON> said commonly built and used the bombs, is jailed in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after a police raid last October that netted weapons and three bomb devices like the one used to blow up Flight 103. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> has denied that his group receives money from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but has said he shared <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s outrage at how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year shot down an <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> civilian passenger plane. `` I see now that the incident of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> is neither worse nor uglier than the destruction of the Iranian airbus,'' <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Both of them are crimes against civilians, whether by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration or by terrorist groups who may have blown up the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. They are equally barbaric.'' While denying his group's involvement, <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> issued a warning should the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> strike his camps in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. `` We shall not remain still. Our response shall be equal if not more violent,'' he said.

<HEAD>Wright Seeks to Have Charges Dropped as Ethics Committee Digs Deeper</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee plans to dig deeper into a lucrative <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> gas investment by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as lawyers for the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat seek to pare down the list of charges already filed against him. And the panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., gave a strong vote of confidence to special outside counsel <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer who conducted the long probe that so far has produced 69 charges that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated House rules Attacks on <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s professionalism by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyers are `` totally inaccurate, totally wrong and an exercise in bad judgment,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said, adding that he has `` total confidence in him.'' At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed renewed interest in the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> matter and in particular his connection with allegedly illegal campaign contributions made in 1985 for a special <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> election. The ethics panel met for 2 -LCB- hours on Wednesday and voted to make available to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyers some witnesses and documents that have figured in its 11-month investigation of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat. But the panel denied <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s motion to bar <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> from having any private contact with the ethics committee, a decision in line with its belief that he is acting more as a staff member of the panel than as a prosecutor. It also directed <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> to investigate further the <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> gas drilling venture which boosted <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s worth substantially last year. The investment involves a gas well near the Texas-Louisiana line, which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> bought into for $ 9,120 last January. They sold their interest less than five months later for a $ 340,000 profit, even though the well's production had dwindled. The committee wants to know whether the deal amounted to another gift to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> by investors seeking to curry favor with a powerful legislator. The panel last week interviewed five Texans involved in the well deal and decided other witnesses still need to be heard from, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s defense team, beefed up this week to include eight lawyers, filed a new motion on Wednesday asking that the two most serious charges be dismissed because they are based on faulty interpretation of House rules. The attorneys asked that the ethics panel drop charges that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> evaded <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules limiting outside earned income through bulk sales of a book he wrote, and that the speaker improperly accepted $ 145,000 in gifts from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, who was deemed to have had a direct interest in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The charges amount to `` a house of cards delicately balanced on a series of unprecedented reinterpretations of House rules,'' according to the motion. One member of the defense team, Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said it is clear that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules have grown outmoded and need to be revised. `` They are dated, time has passed, circumstances have changed and ethical standards have appropriately risen,'' he said. But he said the ethics committee is seeking to apply those higher standards to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> retroactively, which is unfair to the speaker. Also on Wednesday, chief <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the department plans an independent review of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s business and political dealings once the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics process runs its course `` I expect the department will take an independent look'' should the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> exonerate <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. The department has been collecting publicly available information on the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case for several months, and plans to have its public integrity section review the evidence for possible criminal violations. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said such a review would cover matters brought up by the ethics committee and `` other matters that have been raised,'' such as <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s involvement in a 1985 political fund-raising effort in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In testimony last week at a federal fraud trial in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was linked to a political action committee that collected allegedly illegal contributions from officials of Commodore Savings and Loan, an insolvent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrift. A witness said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was said to have promised to block legislation seen as unfavorable by the S & amp; L industry in return for $ 250,000 in donations to the <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has denied the charge. On Wednesday, three former Commodore employees testified they gave money to the <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION>, and later were reimbursed by their company, either through pay increases or checks for fictional travel. Former Commodore president <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morten </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, his brother <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, former Commodore CEO and vice chairman of the board, are being tried on charges they misused Commodore funds to make illegal PAC contributions. East Texas First raised and spent about $ 100,000 to help Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, win the 1985 special election.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> vowed to put 1,600 more workers on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s shores, but said it would take up to six weeks to get them to the front lines of the nation's worst oil spill. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s promise came Wednesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ordered it to expand its cleanup. State and federal officials have repeatedly criticized <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> for moving too slowly to clean up the March 24 spill. An Exxon spokesman said the number of shore-based workers would reach 5,000 by late June. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said the buildup had to be gradual to provide training and housing. `` You've got to house all these people, you've got feed these people, you've got to train them,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that despite the increased manpower he considers it almost impossible for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to clean all the oil from more than 300 miles of shoreline by its Sept. 15 target date. As part of its cleanup plan, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> also has requested that some environmental laws be waived so it can burn off the oily wastes and process oily water at the Valdez treatment plant normally used by oil companies to clean bilge water from their tankers. Both options were scorned at a hearing Wednesday night. Speakers expressed concern about air pollution from the burning, and said the terminal plant was inadequate for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s needs. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> expects to collect more than 55,000 tons of contaminated material, from tainted water to soiled clothing worn by cleanup workers. `` I feel the people of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, the people of <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> and the people of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> have given their fair share of blood in this situation,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Winchester </PERSON>, a local environmentalist. `` I think you boys ought to go home and work this through again.'' Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to beef up its cleanup operation and provide federal officials with weekly, detailed operations schedules of cleanup work outside <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, where the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground and spilled its load. The order, announced in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> by Vice Adm. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, was the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s official response to the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> cleanup plan submitted May 1 for <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> approval. The oil, spreading steadily, has fouled beaches along <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s coast as far south as <LOCATION> Wide </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, about 450 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> Authorities said Wednesday they also discovered oil patches on the west coast of <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The crippled tanker is being repaired at Naked Island in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> plans to move the 987-foot vessel to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> next month. The hull was ripped open by the crash and there are huge boulders inside the cargo hold, scooped up as the craft scraped against the reef, said <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s on-site commander of the spill cleanup. He said it appeared doubtful that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> could meet its Sept. 15 cleanup deadline. `` I am seriously concerned that the investment of resources you describe will not be able to clean the 300-plus miles of shoreline in the time alloted,'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> general manager <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, the company's ranking executive in the spill zone. Workers, meanwhile, toiled on the four islands hardest hit by the spill in the sound, hoping to clean the shores a few days before seals begin their annual birthing cycle about May 20. There are about 10,000 seals in the sound, and between 25 and 50 percent may have been in areas affected by the spill, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigman </PERSON>, a biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game. No seal deaths have been attributed directly to the spill, although biologists say they have seen heavily oiled seals. As of Tuesday, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said there had been 613 confirmed sea otter deaths and 9,918 bird kills.

 This just in: The climate of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> changed dramatically 20 million years ago when high plateaus rose up in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. With new threats to the climate looming, upwards of 3,000 scientists have gathered here this week for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s semiannual exchange of ideas on weather and climate, volcanoes, earthquakes, water, the solar system and even politics. Several hundred listeners assembled Wednesday to hear Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., discuss the need for leadership to combat the threats of global warming, acid rain and wasteful energy policies `` You do n't have to be an alarmist to recognize that if the Earth's average temperature rises as much as five degrees ... it will completely change our way of life,'' observed <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. In another hall, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruddiman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lamont-Doherty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> explained his calculation showing that the rise of the mountains in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> forced the winds to shift direction around them, causing climate changes that led to the ice ages Scientists have long speculated about the reasons for the ice ages. <PERSON> Ruddiman </PERSON>, a marine geologist, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutzbach </PERSON>, a climatologist from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, say computerized models of the Earth's climate are convincing them that the rising mountains and high plateaus were the major factor in cooling off <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the northern parts of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. In addition, they said, those shifts in the wind helped change the flow of ocean currents and led to conditions that promote the summer monsoons in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, dry summers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and increase the cold winter winds in parts of the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A pair of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> scientists, meanwhile, reported their conclusion that the barrage of charged particles from the sun may be contributing to the damage to the Earth's protective ozone layer. <PERSON> Linwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Callis </PERSON> reported that the flow of high-energy particles from the sun leads to the formation of oxides of nitrogen in the upper parts of the stratosphere. In turn, those nitrogen compounds can settle into the stratosphere where `` if you have any kind of significant buildup, then what you have is the possibility of catalytic destruction of ozone,'' said <PERSON> Callis </PERSON>. Ozone helps protect the earth from potentially damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Losing some of the ozone could lead to an increased incidence of skin cancer. `` What the model calculations show and that the data confirm is that from 1979 to 1985 the -LRB- nitrogen oxide -RRB- levels in the polar lower stratosphere probably increased between 30 and 80 or 90 percent. In the equatorial region there have been increases, much smaller, on the order of 10 or 15 percent,'' <PERSON> Callis </PERSON> said. Damage to the ozone over the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> has been widely discussed in recent years. <PERSON> Callis </PERSON> said that so-called <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> `` ozone hole'' appears to be largely a result of chlorine compounds trapped over the polar areas, since ice particles in this region tend to remove many nitrogen compounds from the air. `` The interest that we have in this is primarily related to global ozone ... there are larger than expected ozone changes,'' said <PERSON> Callis </PERSON>. In the air about 16 miles above the surface, the area where ozone is most concentrated, <PERSON> Callis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> found the gas depleted by as much as 14 percent between 1979 and 1985, <PERSON> Callis </PERSON> said. Natural changes in the solar cycle should reduce the amount of incoming charged particles between now and the mid-1990s, said <PERSON> Callis </PERSON>, and he and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> are anxious to see if ozone levels will recover during that period. While modern and ancient climate changes were under discussion, the massive convention center swarmed with students in jeans, geologists in string ties, nervous speakers rehearsing their presentations and political advocates proclaiming the Greenhouse warming a hoax. A steady drizzle dampened arrivals, while an appropriately placed booth emblazoned `` Hydrology'' greeting them just inside the main entrance.

<HEAD>House Panel Chairman Says Acid Rain Bill Would Unfairly Burden Nine
States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A House panel chairman, demonstrating that the acid rain debate will again pit blocks of states against one other, says proposed legislation to cut sulfur dioxide emissions would place an unfair burden on nine states. Rep. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s energy and power subcommittee, wrote President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday that the nine states account for 52 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, considered the leading cause of acid rain. But <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said three congressional proposals introduced so far would require the nine to achieve 77 percent of the nation's required reductions The affected states are <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Sharp, D-Ind., wrote <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because the administration is developing its own acid rain proposals, which could be submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this month `` Nine states in the nation should not be cleaning up both their own and somebody else's portion of the national reduction,'' <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the letter. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said the proposed legislation would emphasize reduction of sulfur dioxide emitted from older, coal-fired electric power plants rather than from industrial facilities. The nine states, because of their geography, use coal-fired plants largely because they do not have access to hydro-power and natural gas, <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said. `` A pound of sulfur dioxide, removed from the air, is of equal benefit to the environment whether it is removed from a small industrial facility in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or a large power plant in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>,'' the letter said. In the past, the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, the primary victim of acid rain, sought immediate action while Midwestern states feared controls on their coal-fired plants would boost electric bills. States that produce large amounts of high-sulfur coal _ <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ worried that controls would cause massive job losses in the coal industry. The West, where low-sulfur coal is mined and acid rain is a less serious problem, has been reluctant to pay the cost for new controls. Acid rain is formed when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are converted in the atmosphere into acids, which travel far from their starting points to pollute lakes and forests and, according to health experts, cause serious respiratory problems for asthmatics, children and the elderly. The leading sources of sulfur dioxide are coal-burning power plants and industrial facilities. Nitrogen oxides are emitted in approximately equal amounts for asthmatics, children and the elderly.

After he took down the flag there in April 1950, he returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and was named chief of the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> desk at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, but was suspended a year later as a security risk. <PERSON> Clubb </PERSON> was condemned by a loyalty board but was cleared on appeal. He was then assigned to an obscure <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> job and resigned after deciding his career was ruined. In 1932, <PERSON> Clubb </PERSON> reported from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that the Communists were popular in the regions they controlled and that the U.S.-supported Chinese Nationalists were corrupt but that they might force the Communists to flee to the west.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is n't ruling out a campaign for mayor of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, but says he's `` not looking for something to do'' and has no current plans to run. Facing persistent questions about reports he is weighing a race for mayor of the nation's capital, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> repeated his pledge not to challenge embattled incumbent <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. But he declined to say what he would do if <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> steps aside. `` I need not deal in the hypothetical,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I take this process of public service seriously, and I take it one day at a time.'' The two-time candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination responded to questions about the mayoral race at a news conference following an appearance before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee where he called for a federal law making voter registration easier and more accessible. Entering the hearing, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got a taste of the speculation about his future that has filled political circles. `` Should we be saying, ` Welcome, Mr. Mayor?''' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., asked jokingly as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took his seat at the witness table `` I think it's out of order,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> responded. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> dismissed a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll showing he would be the runaway leader if he runs for mayor, saying it would not influence his thinking. `` As a matter of fact, if they conducted a poll on who Democrats would want nationally to be the -LRB- presidential -RRB- nominee, I'd be No. 1 in that poll as well,'' he said. `` So I must keep all those polls in focus.'' The poll said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would win 68 percent of the vote to 17 percent for <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. The poll of 1,021 registered voters in the city also found that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, facing declining support because of questionable behavior and mounting city problems, would lose in one-one-one matchups with four other possible challengers. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and would have to move to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by this November, a year ahead of the mayoral election, if he is to become a candidate. He owns a vacant home in the city and is renovating it. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the renovations are `` for practical reasons'' because he is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> several days a week and intends to use it instead of staying in hotels. `` I've said very clearly and often I have no plans to run for mayor of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I support the current mayor as mayor of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and my position is as clear as it can be.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that he is active as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, the political and civil rights group he founded, and is not ready to give up national political ambitions. `` I'm sufficiently busy. I'm not looking for something to do,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` If there is ever any change in my basic work priorities, I'll be all too willing to share it with you,'' he said

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rebounded today against the Japanese yen while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s main index gained moderately. The dollar closed at 134.55 yen, up 0.11 yen from Wednesday's 134.44 yen finish It opened at 134.18 yen and ranged from 134.17 yen to 134.60 yen. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency had declined 0.56 yen on Wednesday after closing Tuesday at 135.00 yen, its highest closing in eight months. Today, speculative investors bought the dollar near the day's lowest levels, said <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> `` It's not much of a rise considering it hit a high of 134.70 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, but still, Japanese investors' fundamental demand for the dollar remains the same,'' she said Ms. <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> said reports of two economic indicators today and Friday also are likely to boost demand for the dollar because market players expect no slowdown in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy in April. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to announce April figures for retail prices this monring and for producer prices on Friday. On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 39.52-point loser Wednesday, climbed 89.14 points, or 0.26 percent, closing at 34,081.49. `` The Nikkei rose moderately, but trading was thin because a majority of market players remained on the sidelines due to uncertainties over foreign exchange rates and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s discount rate hike,'' said <PERSON> Yoshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Media and market players have speculated that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> will raise its official discount rate by at least 0.5 percentage point to 3.0 percent late in May, but the central bank has not made any official announcement. `` Scheduled releases of two major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic figures later today and Friday also made participants feel reluctant to make major moves,'' <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said. Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 750 million shares, down from Wednesday's 900 million. Among gainers were steel, shipbuilding and construction issues.

But it burgeoned when <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, an original foundation trustee, persuaded his father in 1963 to donate 1.8 million <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> shares worth $ 129 million at the time. When <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> died in 1973 at age 97, the foundation received all but $ 1.3 million of his $ 43.3 million estate.

<HEAD>Bush Picks ``Endeavour'' For Name Of New Space Shuttle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will go after some historical `` color'' by naming its newest space shuttle, built to replace the destroyed Challenger, after a British sailing ship. The space agency announced Wednesday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had selected the name `` Endeavour `` after it was the most popular name in a national name-the-shuttle competition among <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s school children. The Endeavor was the flagship used by 18th century English explorer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. Thirty-one of the 111 state-level winners in the competition chose the name Endeavour, although many of the entries used the American spelling of Endeavor. Second most popular among the state winners, with 12 selections, was Resolution. The competition was in two divisions, kindergarten through grade 6, and grades 7 through 12. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> selected a winning entry in each category. The winning entry for kindergarten through grade 6 was from the fifth graders of <ORGANIZATION> Senatobia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Senatobia </LOCATION>, Miss. Winning in the other division was <ORGANIZATION> Tallulah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tallulah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. For their winning project, the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> fifth graders created a space camp where younger children were taught about space The Tallulah Falls entry had two parts _ a magazine called `` Math Exploration with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>,'' and a play called `` Where on Earth?'' which compared <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>'s explorations with the voyages of a space shuttle called Endeavour. More than 6,100 teams, formed by 71,650 students, submitted research projects supporting the names selected. Panels from each of the state education agencies then sorted through the entries and picked state winners in the two divisions. From these state winners, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his selection. Endeavour was the name <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> chose for the 98-foot vessel he used to explore the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> from 1768 to 1772. He sailed southwest from <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, around <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, then explored the coasts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> by way of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Cape of Good Hope, completing a circumnavigation of the Earth. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> chose the name Resolution for a ship he used in his second and third voyages exploring the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. During those trips, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> went as far north as the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and as far south as the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>. He located and named the <LOCATION> Sandwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, later called <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, and was killed there in 1779. The second vessel in <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>'s company during his final voyage was named Discovery, the same as that given to one of the current space shuttles. Challenger was destroyed Jan. 28, 1986 in an explosion that killed seven astronauts. When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized money for a replacement shuttle, it directed that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s school children would name the new craft. The new shuttle craft is now being built by <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Downey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. It is scheduled for completion in 1991 and will make its first space voyage in March 1992.

 A nuclear aircraft carrier will be christened the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the first time a ship has borne that name since the War of 1812. The name was one of 14 announced Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> for ships that have been approved for construction. Ball, a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appointee who is about to step down from office, said a nuclear-powered carrier that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized for construction last year would carry the designation CVN-75 and be named the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` in honor of our nation.'' Only one previous ship has borne the name _ a sailing frigate that fought during the War of 1812. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> does have another carrier on active duty named <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, however. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said he had selected 13 other names for four Ticonderoga-class cruisers; four <PERSON> Arleigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke-class </PERSON> destroyers; four fleet oilers, and one fast combat support ship.

 Chanel suits, conversations in French and exclamations of `` Darling, how are you!'' are as much a part of the annual spring art auction blitz as multi-million dollar price tags and Japanese investors. Hundreds of paintings by <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> and others make the sales at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auction houses an art-lover's dream. More than a half-billion dollars' worth of art will be sold during the 12 days of blockbuster sales that began May 2. On Wednesday, record prices were paid for Impressionist and modern paintings as bidders set marks for eight artists at a Christie's auction. A Claude Monet painting sold for $ 14.2 million. A day earlier, <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s 1901 self-portrait `` Yo Picasso'' sold for $ 47.85 million at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, second only the $ 53.9 million for <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises'' in 1987. As the rich rub elbows over <PERSON> Degas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>, they're not just ferreting out their personal favorites and the best investments. They're also offering people-watchers a firsthand look at how the other half lives. At a recent <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auction, comments like `` How are things in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>?'' and `` I just got back from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'' were almost as common as pearls and <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> handbags with leather-and-gold chains. A cocktail party at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s, where clients previewed art over asparagus-and-salmon hors d'oeuvres, featured lots of ladies in black off-the-shoulder dresses pecking each other on the cheek. A crimson velvet tunic here and a red satin fringed shawl there lit up the sea of black. `` If I fall in love with something, I might buy it,'' said <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollsman </PERSON>, a silver-haired woman in a gold-and-black spangled tunic. `` But I think a lot of people come here to get free food, free drink and that's about it. They have n't the vaguest intention of bidding on anything.'' Among the non-buyers was <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON>, who got on the party guest list through a relative. `` I was listening to one man who thought a <ORGANIZATION> Renoir </ORGANIZATION> was a steal at $ 3 million, and I thought, I'm in the same room with this person,'' she said. `` It's very <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and I love to do things that are very <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Berenice </PERSON> <PERSON> Berke </PERSON> <PERSON> Hetkin </PERSON>, wearing a dashing black hat and a red-and-black polka-dotted top, attended the party as a possible buyer, but added: `` If you run into somebody you know, it's a plus.'' Art collector <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> disagreed: `` Sometimes you see people you know and you do n't want to talk to them because they might influence your bidding.'' Seats at blockbuster auctions are reserved for collectors, but anyone can get a free ticket to stand by calling in advance. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Porcella </PERSON>, a painter from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, braved the crowded public section at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s on Tuesday because, she said: `` It gives me inspiration to keep going. I know I'm going to be successful and it's inspiring to know that people will pay so much for art.'' Her friend, <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said the auction's art and fashions give her ideas for her work as a jewelry designer. `` I watch what people wear from the ladies' room on.''

<HEAD>NBC Vows to Run `Roe Vs. Wade' Without Ads, If Necessary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Armed with reviews from TV critics praising the made-for-TV movie `` Roe Vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is asking advertisers to stand up to pressure groups seeking to block the film about the case that legalized abortion. In a May 8 letter to advertisers, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> vowed to air the movie as scheduled Monday without advertising if advertisers pull out. `` I'm not writing this letter to simply sell commercial time,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> wrote. `` We will underwrite this project without support, if necessary. We're very proud of ` Roe Vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>.''' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said the status of advertising time sold during the two-hour film was still unsettled and probably would be until the broadcast date. The fact-based movie stars <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> as a character based on <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON>, the then-anonymous `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>'' plaintiff who sued <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wade </ORGANIZATION> in the case that went to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> plays attorney <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Weddington </PERSON>. The abortion battle heightened when the high court heard arguments April 26 in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case that could affect the 1973 decision. The movie is about the pro-choice advocates who prevailed in 1973, but also portrays sympathetically the prosecutors who argued the other side, though they get much less attention. `` This is discriminatory programming against an entire class of people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willke </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is clearly strong pro-abortion propaganda. There is absolutely no claim that can be made that this is balanced, not remotely.'' He said his group was calling on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> affiliates to refuse to show the movie, or provide anti-abortion groups with at least 30 minutes of time to refute the views they believe the movie represents. In an unusual move, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> allowed advertisers to screen the film before deciding whether to sponsor it. `` A few have withdrawn. Others have been added,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>. `` We have n't identified any of the names of advertisers in or out and expect it will be fully sponsored. The next couple of days are going to be crucial.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s letter quoted favorable reviews of the movie and said advertisers should be concerned about threats of boycotts as a way for pressure groups to control program content. `` <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> firmly believes the decision about where your messages appear rests with you and your marketing people _ not with those who have a predisposition to judge a program's merits based on their own agenda and no information,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s letter. NBC News' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> will anchor a 30-minute special later in the evening to discuss abortion, but <PERSON> Willke </PERSON> was n't impressed. `` Baloney,'' he said. `` They are controlling the discussion.'' In his letter, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> referred to recent cases of advertisers pulling out of TV programs because of pressure from groups and individuals who find them offensive. He mentioned no specifics, but shows that have been targeted recently include <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s raunchy sitcom `` Married ... With Children'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s cuttingly satirical `` Saturday Night Live.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> recently canceled two `` reality-based'' specials, `` Crimes of Passion II'' and `` Scandals II'' due to lack of advertiser support because of their expected lurid content. Both were sequels to previous specials that garnered good ratings.

<TEXT>
 The nullification of elections in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was necessary because the opposition, instigated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, violated election laws and attempted to rig the results, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency claimed today. The <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> late Wednesday invalidated Sunday's election, saying the stealing of ballots, vote-buying and missing tally sheets made proclamation of a new president impossible. Both sides had claimed victory in the balloting, which international observers and the opposition claimed were rigged by forces loyal to strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, claimed supporters of opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> had violated election procedures. `` They blockaded polling stations, preventing ballot boxes from being taken to the commission's headquarters in good time,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` A considerable number of ballot papers were stolen or destroyed and several ballot boxes were burned.'' Witnesses and international observers said soldiers loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had stolen ballots from polling stations where voting heavily favored the opposition. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that as results were coming in, `` The opposition, directly instigated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, started heightening the atmosphere by resorting to obviously provocative and subversive actions.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said allowing the election results to remain valid posed `` unpredictable consequences for the country's future.'' The decision to nullify the election `` appears to be extraordinary, but the only correct one,'' the news agency said.

<HEAD>Ability to Freeze Human Embryos Raises Questions for Couples</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The recently acquired ability to freeze human embryos has produced more than 150 babies for previously infertile couples, but it is posing difficult questions for prospective parents, a psychiatrist says. Before having embryos frozen, couples should legally document their wishes on such questions as what to do with the embryos if the parents divorce or die during the process, said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergare </PERSON>. Other issues include what should happen to stored embryos if the woman enters menopause and can no longer be implanted with them, said <PERSON> Vergare </PERSON>, associate chairman of the psychiatry department at the <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Vergare spoke at a news conference and in an interview Wednesday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Such ethical questions are beginning to appear in the nation's courtrooms A Los Angeles-area couple on Wednesday sued a <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in-vitro fertilization center for refusing to release an embryo that was frozen 23 months ago. The couple want to remove their embryo from the <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> so that a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> doctor can attempt to implant it in the woman. In another case, the divorce of a <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> couple has turned into a battle over custody of seven of the woman's eggs that are fertilized with her husband's sperm and kept in frozen storage. A <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> court has scheduled a hearing in July to determine if the embryos are `` joint property'' of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, or subjects for a custody decision. Good embryo-freezing programs provide legal documents that deal with such issues, as well as others such as what to do with embryos if the organization that is storing them goes out of business, <PERSON> Vergare </PERSON> said. At his institution, couples are required to ponder the issues before proceeding with the freezing, he said. Embryo-freezing has become part of in-vitro fertilization programs, with which normally infertile couples can have children with the help of egg-fertilizing in the laboratory. Virtually every major city now offers programs with embryo-freezing, said <PERSON> Vergare </PERSON>, who is psychiatric consultant to the <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> center's in-vitro program. Babies born so far from frozen embryos have appeared generally healthy and normal, <PERSON> Vergare </PERSON> said. The technique has been used sucessfully in animal husbandry for years, but whether it will prove to have long-term effects in people is unknown, he said. `` Cows are n't expected to study algebra,'' he said. In the case filed in federal court in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Risa </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON> asked for $ 200,000 for alleged emotional damages and the immediate release of their embryo. Between August 1986 and July 1987, when the couple lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> York </PERSON> went to the institute four times to attempt in-vitro fertilization. Doctors managed to fertilize 12 of her eggs, and 11 of those were implanted without success, according to court papers. The 12th embryo was frozen for future implantation, but the <ORGANIZATION> Yorks </ORGANIZATION> moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and later notified Dr. <PERSON> Suheil </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muasher </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, that they wanted to take the frozen embryo to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where local doctors would implant it. Dr. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, co-founder and president of the institute, said agreeing to the <ORGANIZATION> Yorks </ORGANIZATION>' request could set a precedent by forcing the release of fertilized eggs to doctors who might be unqualified to perform the procedure.

 Opposition vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said he froze when he saw the iron bar coming. `` But at the same time my assistant pulled me away and the bar missed my head by a few inches.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> was describing how he was attacked Wednesday by a gang of thugs loyal to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. His presidential running mate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and second vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> suffered head injuries during the clash. The violence put an end to a peaceful demonstration that escalated into a confrontation and an exchange of gunfire. Four security men were wounded and one of the candidates' civilian bodyguards killed, officials said The demonstrators were protesting government attempts to `` steal'' an election they say <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> won. Both sides claimed victory. The opposition cavalcade had wound through the streets of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> until it stopped in front of a group of riot troops. `` We were talking with an officer in charge about withdrawing,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said. `` We were told to wait. At that moment the paramilitary broke through the ranks of the riot police and started shooting.'' Witnesses said the candidates' bodyguards leaped out of cars and started returning fire, although <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> denied his men had weapons. Witnesses also said the demonstrators had thrown rocks and bottles at the paramilitary `` Dignity Battalions,'' who were standing behind the riot police. `` I ran into an alley with other people,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said. `` People were falling into each other. I fell and then about five people fell on top of me. I could not breathe. Then I heard someone say ` my vice president', and he and others picked me up and took me inside a store.'' The man who picked him up, <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, said he and others also picked up <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and put him in a truck to take him to a hospital. The Dignity Battalion is made up of civilians recruited into armed groups with the expressed purpose of defending <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in case of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion, which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been saying could happen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, has been de facto leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since 1983. `` The world knows ... that what's at stake here is not <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> -LRB- as the government claims -RRB- but the desire of a people to be free,'' said <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>.

 Troops took to the streets today after the government nullified the elections and opposition candidates, beaten by supporters of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, apparently went in hiding. Opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two running mates had been beaten by bat - and pipe-wielding civilian thugs <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said one of their bodyguards was killed. Soldiers, who did not interfere as the candidates were beaten Wednesday afternoon, had halted an opposition motorcade protesting what international observers have called the government's theft of Sunday's elections. The demonstration had sought to rally international opinion against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and prevent the proclamation of his candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, as president. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> condemned the attack and called the nullification, announced late in the day, as a `` cowardly act'' of contempt for the choice made by the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said dependents of the 12,000 military and diplomatic personnel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> who live off-base would be moved today to military bases to ensure their safety. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel were told to stay out of public places unless on official business, and then to appear only in civilian clothes. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been trying for more than a year to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the country's de facto leader since 1983 and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief. The opposition said Wednesday's attack showed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has not been seen in public since the weekend, is getting desperate. `` They now know they can not carry out the electoral fraud they planned. It is already a scandal throughout the world,'' said first vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, who also was beaten. Second vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> was beaten bloody and, like <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, suffered a head wound. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said Ford and several other opposition officials including press spokesman <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> were apparently under arrest. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and other officials said one of the candidates' bodyguards was killed and about 20 demonstrators injured. The military said four soldiers were wounded in an exchange of gunfire that followed the attack on the candidates. Also Wednesday, the government expelled nine foreign journalists, accusing them of spreading misinformation. The expelled included an Cable News Network correspondent and two reporters working for the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. Vote counting had yet to be finalized in this country of 2.2 million when the electoral commission announced the balloting had been voided. In a proclamation, it cited vote-stealing, vote-buying, missing tally sheets and international interference as behind the move. The commission said nothing about rescheduling the vote. More than 300 observers, including Europeans, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation as well as former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, backed opposition claims that <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> won by a 3-to-1 margin. `` This does not change anything. It makes it worse,'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has closed out his options.'' <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulice </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>, charged in a nationwide broadcast that the outcome of the vote was `` altered by the obstructionist action by the many foreigners called in by foreign or domestic political forces without invitation.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, charging that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s forces planned to fix the elections, had sent an uninvited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> reportedly contributed $ 10 million to the opposition campaign. Opposition supporters throughout the city began beating on pots and pans after the nullification announcement, chanting `` <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> is my president.'' But the streets quieted as truckloads of soldiers appeared, dropping squads off around the city. The soldiers searched buses, trucks and cars for weapons. Members of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> also were reported on the move in other cities. Dozens of telephone calls to opposition leaders at homes, offices and hotels after the election announcement found not even one. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who suffered a scalp wound that took eight stitches to close, was spending the night in <LOCATION> Paidilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, according to his wife, but the hospital said he was not there. `` I blame <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for everything bad that has happened,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said in a brief hospital interview during the afternoon. Angry crowds broke windows and burned at least six cars in the downtown area. Police broke up scattered groups of demonstrators with tear gas and gunshots fired in the air. The attack on the candidates occurred as they were touring the city from the bed of a pickup truck. When the pickup was halted by a police blockade it was surrounded by a group of men wearing `` Dignity Battalion'' T-shirts and waving iron bars, baseball bats and rubber hoses. `` By this action <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has demonstrated his contempt for the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> at a news conference. The government, in television broadcasts, accused the opposition of trying to set the stage for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention. Government television showed footage of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, of a CIA-inspired coup in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, and of the coup that toppled President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. The opposition rejects <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s accusations that it is trying to help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> violate the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, which cede the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the year 2000. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> began its campaign to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after he orchestrated President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after the general was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges in February 1988. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies the drug charges.

 A man charged with killing his ex-wife with an assault rifle then going on a three-hour aerial rampage _ buzzing buildings and firing at cars _ had been placed on probation just hours before the shooting. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, 42, had been convicted Tuesday of assault and battery and of violating a protective order stemming from a New Year's Eve fight with his wife over which television station to watch. She had first asked for a restraining order in January 1988. The couple's six-year marriage ended in divorce four months later. Salem District Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> placed <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> on one year's probation. The trouble began later that evening when police in <LOCATION> Danvers </LOCATION>, about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, responded to a domestic dispute call. They found the body of <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, 30, in her apartment, shot several times with an AK-47 assault rifle, state Trooper <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said the couple's 5-year-old son saw his father kill his mother. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> fled, stole a car from a restaurant in nearby <LOCATION> Peabody </LOCATION> and then commandeered a <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> airplane, which he flew helter-skelter over a 60-mile area of <LOCATION> Greater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, dive-bombing buildings and firing the automatic rifle, police said. He was captured when he landed at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> early Wednesday, was charged with murder and armed robbery and ordered held without bail for 20 days' psychiatric observation. Before the assault and battery conviction, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> had pleaded guilty in 1979 to assaulting a group of people with a machete and was sentenced to one year's probation. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> told police the group had tried to rob him. The machete incident did not show up in the probation papers given to the judge before Tuesday's sentencing, <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` I'm not sure that the outcome would have been any different,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. A court-appointed pychiatrist, Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> told him during an examination Wednesday that he had been treated for psychiatric problems at a Veteran's <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and was taking a minor tranquilizer, Lorazepam, for anxiety. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Police today were piecing together <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s flight from hundreds of witnesses' reports. Stockbroker <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was walking to a tavern when he heard popping noises from the sky and spotted a low-flying plane. `` About two seconds later, several shell casings landed all around. At that point I realized that the guy was shooting out of his plane,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. During the flight, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> dipped under a bridge, veered within 50 feet of motorists and buildings and fired at targets including parked cars and the Prudential tower's 50th floor skywalk. Police in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> received more than 200 calls about shots being fired. In suburban <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, police said two cars were hit in a shower of gunfire believed to have come from the plane. <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> air traffic controllers twice evacuated the tower. They said <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> buzzed them repeatedly, forcing officials to close the airport for an hour and reroute late-night flights. `` We have a very thick handbook on the rules of air traffic control, but there's nothing in there about what to do if a maniac comes shooting an AK-47 at you in the control tower,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 A Titan rocket packing a secret <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> payload streaked off on an apparently routine flight into orbit, but the fiery blastoff ignited brush fires that closed the launch area for more than an hour. The $ 65 million Titan 34D lifted off at 3:47 p.m. Wednesday and appeared to be flying normally through a partly cloudy sky. As with other military space flights, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> did not announce the launch in advance. But with more than 20,000 employees working at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> and adjacent Kennedy Space Center, it could n't hide the fact that the 16-story-tall rocket was going to be launched. Minutes before liftoff, hundreds of workers poured out of buildings to watch. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> issued a brief post-launch statement saying only that a Titan 34D had been launched successfully. It provided no information on the nature of the payload. There was no damage to launch pad from brush fires triggered by the rocket's exhaust, officials said. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Aloysius </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, retiring commander of the Air Force Space Division, told a conference last year that the first Titan 34D launched in 1989 would carry up two communications satellites named DSCS _ for <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>. The satellites are built to provide secure voice and high data rate transmission for American military and diplomatic communications. Sources close to the project who spoke on condition of anonynity said Wednesday the satellites were aboard the Titan 34D. A Chalet satellite designed to monitor Soviet communications networks was aboard a Titan 34D launched last Sept. 2. An upper stage failure left that payload in the wrong orbit. On Nov. 6, a Titan 34D successfully launched a payload believed to be a pair of satellites intended to monitor Soviet missile tests and electronic communciations. One Titan 34D remains in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> inventory. It is scheduled for launch from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> later this year and will be replaced by the more powerful Titan 4. The first Titan 4 is scheduled for launch here within a few weeks, carrying a satellite designed to provide instant warning of a hostile missile attack on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Miners Return to Work after Agreement Reached; Bug Found In Solidarity
Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Miners at four southwestern copper mines ended a six-day strike today and returned to work after winning 30 percent pay increases plus higher bonuses, a Solidarity spokesman said. In another development, Solidarity called on the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the planting of an eavesdropping device in one of its campaign offices after local officials refused to look into the matter. Preparatory work to reopen the mines began with the first shift, following the acceptance of the agreement by workers on Wednesday night, said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugalski </PERSON> of Solidarity, a member of the strike committee. Normal work at the mines was to start in the afternoon, he said. The strike which began May 5 and involved up to 20,000 miners had been the first major instance of labor unrest since the April 5 signing of a broad agreement between Communist authorities and the Solidarity-led opposition. The agreement led to the reinstatement of Solidarity after a seven-year ban and a government promise to allow the opposition to run for one-third of the seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s lower house and all the seats in its new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The June elections are to be the first open balloting in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. The free trade union movement said the strike was inspired by the official <ORGANIZATION> OPZZ </ORGANIZATION> unions but joined by Solidarity members frustrated by high inflation, which has reached an 80 percent annual rate this year. <PERSON> Sugalski </PERSON> said the miners won a 30 percent increase in basic wages plus a 30 percent bonus if production goals are met. They originally demanded a 50 percent increase in basic pay. The increase in basic wages averages about $ 1.40 a day, he said. The miners now earn $ 112 to $ 169 a month. `` Solidarity helped miners win pay for the period of the strike, and we are very happy about it,'' said <PERSON> Sugalski </PERSON>. The agreement also calls for `` urgent changes'' in the pay system, he said. Miners have long complained that the pay structure undervalues labor performed during the normal five-day work week, forcing miners to work weekends to make ends meet. The strikes were at four mines near the city of <LOCATION> Lubin </LOCATION>, about 200 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the strike reduced output by 100,000 tons of ore daily. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is the world's eighth-largest producer of refined copper. In 1987, it exported to the West more than 161,000 tons, worth about $ 233 million. Solidarity workers found the electronic eavesdropping device in campaign offices in the northern provincial capital of <LOCATION> Slupsk </LOCATION>, union spokesman said <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Moskwa </PERSON> said Wednesday. Hew told a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> news conference that the device was found Tuesday in a wall in the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> office the city about 50 miles east of the port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. Government spokesman <PERSON> Pawel </PERSON> <PERSON> Byra </PERSON> said he knew nothing about it. `` The <LOCATION> Slupsk </LOCATION> case sheds a clear and worrying light on methods applied by the coalition-government side in the election campaign. It was proved again that the Polish state is still an instrument of a political monopoly,'' said a statement released by Solidarity's national citizens committee The committee is coordinating the free trade union movement's campaign for June's partially democratic elections <PERSON> Moskwa </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Slupsk </LOCATION> committee asked the local prosecutor's office to investigate, but it refused The national committee then complained in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the police.

<TEXT>
 The government's announcement that the presidential election had been nullified was accompanied by a level of gringo-bashing seldom seen in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Stern voices on government radio told of alleged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempts to undermine the elections, and television viewers were shown clips from bad movies, documentary footage of the 1965 <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> uprising and the 1962 Bay of Pigs fiasco. Film showing unspeakable torture scenes was broken up by flash-frames of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> emblem and headquarters, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops training and former President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who sent <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers to quell the uprising in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Then it was back to movie clips in which sinister American plots were discussed to topple governments. A Cuban documentary said foreign intervention, especially American, had brought poverty and misery to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` Now, together, we will conjugate the verb ` to decolonialize,''' it said. A government program showed American firepower and pictures of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to keep the canal after the turn of the century in violation of 1977 treaties. On national radio, a speaker went down a list of countries friendly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>? They ca n't even take care of or clean up their own situation. `` Costa Rica? What can we say about <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>?'' the speaker asked, alleged that it was well known that the Nobel Prize won by President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> in 1987 was bought and paid for. News programs of Wednesday's parade that ended in the beatings of opposition candidates for president and vice president said the violence was provoked by `` Attacks by paramilitary troops of the opposition to create for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a justification to invade <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> just as they did in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in 1965.'' There was no mention of the beatings or of the death of one candidate's bodyguard. The government statement nullifying the vote partly blamed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>: `` The normal development of the elections was altered by obstructionist acts of many foreigners called here by political forces within or outside the country who did not have an invitation from the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> and whose obvious aim was to circulate the idea of electoral fraud proclaimed to the world by American authorities well before the elections.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had sent an uninvited delegation that virtually crashed the election and was highly critical of the process. Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the nation's de facto leader, started promoting the theme of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a threat more than a year ago when he was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug charges and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> mounted a campaign to force him from power. But <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has had closed ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over the years and Panamanians have mixed feelings about their neighbor to the North. `` I have a son in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. I'm not against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, I suppose we're friends,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON>, who works in an electronic supply house. `` But they have no right to intervene in our affairs.'' <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, a restaurant worker, said: `` I thought President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had more common sense. Who are we, his children?''

 The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s English department says his recent resignation was prompted in part by lenient treatment of a professor accused of making sexual advances on a student <PERSON> Emory </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> is one of four members of the English faculty to resign since a controversy erupted over the September incident, which involved a male English professor and a male graduate student. The professor, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON>, 62, was suspended that month for one year. Faculty members had hoped he would be eased out altogether, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> said. The student who allegedly was the target of the advance reported it to police last week, but it was unclear if charges would be filed. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Otis </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the student, said his client told police it was a `` criminal assault of a sexual nature'' but denied the student was alleging rape or sexual assault. <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> said there was a `` definite reason'' the student did not go to police sooner, but the attorney refused to elaborate. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wills </PERSON>, <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON>'s lawyer, said the student's delay cast doubt on his allegations. University officials have refused to comment on <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON>'s suspension or on the alleged incident The Princetonian, the student newspaper, reported that the episode occurred after an English department party. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, who is leaving for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, said his disillusionment with the <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> school's administration mounted after it notified the faculty in January it would allow <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON> to return in the fall `` We had been given hope early on in the fall there would be a resolution, that the professor would accept some kind of other position or early retirement, that we would not be looking forward to his return to the classroom,'' <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> said. Several English students said in interviews that the dispute over <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON> was part of a deeper morale problem in the department that stemmed partly from insufficient financial support. Another of the departing professors, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Doody </PERSON>, said the university's handling of the matter was `` a very serious factor'' in her decision. The other English faculty members reportedly leaving <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> are <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, both feminist literary critics. Neither returned messages left Wednesday on their home answering machines.

<HEAD>Report Urges Routine AIDS Testing for All Adults</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 All Americans under age 60 should be encouraged by their doctors to be tested for the AIDS virus, regardless of their risk of being infected, two physicians recommend today. Currently, most experts recommend limiting routine AIDS testing to people who are at obvious increased risk of the disease. In their report in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, Drs. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhame </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> said doctors should take a more active role in promoting AIDS testing for their patients. `` Our greatest concern is to reach the great number of persons infected with HIV who are not availing themselves of any current options in testing and who are not confronting their risk for HIV infection,'' they wrote. Testing reveals infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. People may carry this virus for many years before becoming sick. They said that doctors might raise the subject with patients by saying: `` I recommend an HIV test to all my patients because some people who have risked exposure to HIV do n't realize it, and many persons whose activities put them at risk find it difficult to disclose them.'' Among the benefits of widespread testing that they cited: _ People who know they are infected will benefit from earlier treatment with the AIDS drug AZT as well as therapy for infections associated with AIDS Such medicines can prolong people's lives but not cure the disease. _ People who know they are infected may be more careful not to pass the virus on to others _ Taking the test would remind people that AIDS is potentially a problem for anyone _ Candidates for research studies of new AIDS drugs would be identified `` We are recommending HIV testing vigorously to all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults under the age of 60 regardless of their reported risk history,'' the doctors wrote. The doctors said they doubted that aggressive testing programs would drive people away from the medical care system, as some have argued. They said that falsely positive results _ another argument against widespread testing _ would be rare. They said the suggestion that infected people should be protected from the bad news is `` somewhat paternalistic'' and counter to the trend toward a patient's right to know. `` In essence, we are arguing that HIV infection should be treated as much as possible like another infectious disease,'' they wrote.

 Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> gave a brief admission of guilt before a hastily gathered <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> session, saying he had erred in judgment by taking money from companies doing business with the city. But council members said Wednesday's admission would not lower the heat for <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, facing the crisis of his political career for accepting fees from <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Loan. `` I've been very proud of the high level of unquestioned integrity and character, which have been a part of my 47 years of public service in this city,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. `` So let me state, frankly, that I made an error in judgment by engaging in outside employment, which, although not legally wrong, has created the perception that I fell short of my own high standards in government.'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> made the remarks in a two-minute address to the council, then left without taking questions from either council members or reporters. Not all of the council's members were satisfied. `` I do n't think it was clear enough; I do n't think it was convincing enough,'' said Councilwoman <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> `` did n't address the issue of lying, the inconsistencies in his statements,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON>, who heads a council panel overseeing the city attorney's investigation of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. Council members <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernani </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON>, however, stood to applaud the mayor. City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> is investigating whether there was a conflict of interest in <LOCATION> Bradley </LOCATION> receiving payment to serve on the boards of the two financial institutions while they did business with the city. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is looking into stock investments handled for <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was insensitive not to realize that accepting outside employment could create the perceptions we see today,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. `` I will always regret it.'' The issue of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s finances arose shortly after the former city councilman and police lieutenant was elected in April to an unprecedented fifth term as mayor of the nation's second-largest city. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has returned $ 18,000 paid him by <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to serve as an adviser.

The city's investigation will continue, council members said. `` Maybe he asked for forgiveness, but the process has to move forward,'' Councilwoman <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Picus </PERSON> said. `` I suspect that he thought maybe it would end it, but it could n't possibly, in reality.''

 A judge who dismissed a charge against Grand Ole Opry star <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> for allegedly hitting a woman in the face with a Bible also ordered the woman to stay away from the bluegrass pioneer. Sumner County Judge <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheatcraft </PERSON> dismissed the assault and battery charge on Wednesday and expressed her sympathy for <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. `` I know this warrant has been an embarrassment to you,'' the judge told <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. `` I'm so happy,'' he said outside the courtroom. `` It's been difficult with people bothering me. I'm glad it's over.'' When <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> arrived Wednesday for the hearing, Sheriff <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> confiscated a loaded .25 - caliber pistol from her pickup <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingrum </PERSON> said he requested the search because Mrs. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> said several times she had received word someone wanted to kill <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. Prosecutors told the judge they had witnesses who said Mrs. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> called <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>'s office and home, sometimes up to 15 times a day and often using aliases. A tearful Mrs. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> denied making the harassing phone calls. `` You can pay people to tell all kind of lies,'' she said as she left the parking lot. `` I've been deceived. I've been betrayed. I got beat up,'' she said. `` I did not threaten to kill him. If I wanted to, I could have when we were alone.'' The Bible incident allegedly took place after Mrs. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, 51, asked <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, 77, to swear on it that he had n't been seeing other women. Mrs. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> has been described only as a fan of the musician. Before the May 1 Bible incident, she had called the farm to warn workers she was coming to see <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> to retrieve some gifts she gave him, Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Gay </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ingrum </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> wanted to take back some blue jeans, a tie tack, a hatband and $ 27 for garden seeds she had given <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. `` She threw the britches in the yard, the hatband in the mule yard and the $ 27 in Mr. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>'s face,'' <PERSON> Ingrum </PERSON> said. `` We never did find the tie tack, and she threw her glasses on top of the roof.'' <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Goodlettsville </LOCATION> police to throw Mrs. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> off his farm, <PERSON> Gay </PERSON> said. She asked them to arrest <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, but they refused to file charges against him. Mrs. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> went to a magistrate, who issued the assault warrant. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> was arrested May 2, and released on $ 500 bond. Ingrum obtained a temporary restraining order Wednesday instructing Mrs. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> to stay away from <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> agreed to comply, <PERSON> Gay </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, known for the song `` Blue Moon of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'' and many bluegrass hits, said he did n't like publicity about the incident, `` but my good friends and fans know it was wrong.''

<HEAD>`Godmother,' Others Charged In Cult Leaders' Killings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The woman called the `` godmother'' of a drug-smuggling cult that killed 15 people along the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border has confessed to taking part in ritual slayings, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican authorities say. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON>, 24, and two other alleged cult members were charged Wednesday in the weekend deaths of their leader and his right-hand man, authorities said. Police say the two had ordered their own deaths. A source in the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> attorney general's office said Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> has a split personality, and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neck </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference that she `` confessed to conspiracy and involvement'' in ritual killings. The three were not charged in those killings. Neck returned to <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on Wednesday from a 72-hour trip to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after assisting Mexican authorities in the case. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, a Mexican who attended college in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was wanted on both sides of the border after police, acting on a tip, dug up 15 mutilated bodies at a desolate ranch near the border town of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> on April 11. Cult members boiled brains and other human organs as part of their belief that human sacrifice would give them occult protection when they smuggled marijuana into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, authorities have said. One body was identified as that of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> told reporters at two news conferences earlier this week that she knew nothing about the killings. `` She's giving a lot of data with great detail to investigators working this case right now,'' <PERSON> Neck </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, across the border from <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, director of judicial proceedings for the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> attorney general's office, would only say that Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> `` most certainly is immersed in these crimes.'' The source in the attorney general's office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that when Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> talks to police about cult rituals she loses that `` charming aspect'' she exhibits when she faces television cameras. `` I would say she has three personalities,'' he said. One personality comes out when she faces the cameras and denies any involvement in the human slayings, another emerges when she talks to police and `` the third one comes out when she talks to herself,'' the source said. Neck told reporters, `` <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> has kind of lost touch with reality. No question about it. Her dual personality is coming up pretty strong right now. When you talk to her without the TV cameras there, she's pretty truthful.'' Cult leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, 26, and his right-hand man, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, were killed on Saturday in a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> apartment during a shootout with police. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Orea </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, 22, were charged on Wednesday with homicide in the shootings. They also were charged with criminal association, resisting arrest, shooting a firearm at authorities and for injuries suffered in the gunbattle with police. An arraignment date was not announced. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, a Cuban-born American from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, reportedly instructed de <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> to kill him and <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> as police moved in. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Orea </LOCATION> were charged `` because they had agreed and made a pact before the deaths in case they were going to be arrested,'' <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> said. `` This death pact was carried out.''

<HEAD>Opposition Groups Reject Party Offer For Round-Table Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The country's leading opposition groups have rejected the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to negotiate the details of a transition to a multiparty system, opposition spokesmen said today. The party's governing <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> proposed earlier this week that procedures for next year's promised multiparty elections and other reforms take place in a round-table setting. But the opposition spokesmen said the leaders of eight groups met Wednesday night and decided they wanted to present their views as a single entity. The Communists have demonstrated increasing willingness to share power with other political groups following a severe economic crisis and demand for greater democracy. The Central Committee said the negotiations could be conducted in a setting similar to the series of meetings held recently in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where the government agreed April 5 to reinstate the outlawed trade union Solidarity and allow opposition participation in parliamentary elections. <PERSON> Balint </PERSON> <PERSON> Magyar </PERSON> of the League of Free Democrats said the opposition groups want a two-sided negotiating table and a broader agenda. `` We do not want to negotiate on concrete issues but on the political rules of the game,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> said the talks would have to include a new law on political parties and a new constitution as well as the reforms needed before the June 1990 vote, which is to give voters a choice of parties for the first time in 40 years. According to the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> and a communique distributed by the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>, the opposition groups called on the Communist leadership to make a new proposal within 48 hours. <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fejti </PERSON> told Hungarian television he was surprised by the opposition's swift negative reply.

 Two former TV news managers have been charged with illegally tapping into phone lines and computers at another station to gain a news edge over their competitors. Former news director <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> and assistant news director <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> at WTSP-TV were charged Wednesday with 17 counts of computer hacking and conspiracy in the theft of information through computer phone lines, authorities said. If convicted, each could face a maximum prison sentence of 85 years. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> scheduled their arraignments for May 19. The two were accused of tapping the phone lines and computers of WTVT-TV. The break-ins began in November but were not noticed until Jan. 12, when <ORGANIZATION> WTVT </ORGANIZATION>'s morning news producer noticed that files were missing, authorities said. Computer experts determined that an intruder had rifled the files. `` It's no different than digging a tunnel under their office and coming up and rummaging through their desks,'' said assistant prosecutor <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>. `` It's high-tech burglary.'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> knew <ORGANIZATION> WTVT </ORGANIZATION>'s security system thoroughly, including passwords and identification numbers, because he had helped set it up while working there as an assignment manager, authorities said. He was hired away from <ORGANIZATION> WTVT </ORGANIZATION> in October. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Barresi </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> WTSP </ORGANIZATION>'s general manager, said <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> and Cole were fired when the station learned of the alleged thefts. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, 33, was arrested Feb. 7. After an investigation implicated the 32-year-old Cole, he surrendered April 11. <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said he was considering a civil lawsuit to seize <ORGANIZATION> WTSP </ORGANIZATION>'s assets under the state's racketeering laws He said his decision would depend on whether <ORGANIZATION> WTVT </ORGANIZATION> sued its competitor. `` They're the victims in this case and we're waiting to see what they do,'' <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> WTVT </ORGANIZATION>'s news director, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, said corporate executives and the station's lawyers were weighing the decision.

 Iranian President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said today <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> still demands the execution of British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for his novel `` The Satanic Verses,'' which some say insults Islam. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, speaking at a news conference, also denied that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, had called for the murder of Westerners He said <PERSON> Rafanjani </PERSON>'s words were distorted by the Western media. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, previously regarded as a moderate who supported better ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, is expected to succeed <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> when he finishes his term in office later this year. `` The decision made about <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is still valid,'' <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said. `` As I have already said, this is a bullet for which there is a target. It has been shot. It will one day sooner or later hit the target.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomenei </PERSON>, in February said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> must be killed for writing `` The Satanic Verses,'' which contains passages many Moslems say are insulting to the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has been in hiding since the death threat was issued. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, on a six-day visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, also said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> `` has not recommended anybody kill anybody.'' The Iranian speaker, he said, was offering an analysis that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies toward `` the oppressed people of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> would only lead to such a situation.'' In a speech Friday, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> reportedly called on Palestinians to kill five American, French or British citizens in retaliation for each Arab slain in the uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories.

<HEAD>Charges Dropped Against Man Who Alleges He Painted Over Swastikas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge has dismissed criminal mischief charges against a man who claims he painted over swastikas scrawled in his apartment building, but city officials maintain his story is a lie. The city housing authority asked Municipal Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Falbo </PERSON> to drop the charges against <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> on Wednesday. If convicted, <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>, 59, could have faced six months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> said in March that he painted over swastikas in an elevator and a hallway in his housing project because the authority had ignored his seven months of complaints. A three-member mayoral commission concluded earlier this week that it would be hard to prove <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> intentionally damaged the building. But the panel said a paint expert and a commission member found no evidence of swastikas. `` The truth in this case is that Mr. <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> fabricated a story in order to play upon the people's fears of ethnic hatred to justify his own actions,'' Mayor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Furthermore, Mr. <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> took advantage of the media's sensitivity to such divisive issues by using the swastika _ one of humanity's most horrible symbols of vicious hate and violent crimes _ as a shield to protect himself from further prosecution. <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> does not have a telephone and could not be reached for comment.

<HEAD>Teachers Vote To End Strike, Return To Classroom</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Striking teachers voted by a wide margin to return to the classroom and end a walkout that has kept 10 million students out of school, a union official said. The vote ended a 3-week-old strike by a dissident faction of the pro-government teachers union to demand higher wages and protest alleged union corruption. An agreement between the union and the striking faction `` was approved overwhelmingly'' by the dissident teachers Wednesday night, said the union official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He did not give the vote. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the dissident <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION> agreed to accept a government offer of a 25 percent increase in wages and benefits and to adopt anti-corruption measures. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also said it would replace the superintendents in all 14 of the nation's districts. It said the move was designed to increase efficiency, but it gave no details. The Democratic Coordinate claims the loyalty of about half the union's 1.1 million members, and the strike closed roughly half of the nation's grammar and high schools and vocational institutes. The government had threatened unspecified punitive measures against the striking teachers, but the union official said that all teachers who return to work will suffer no consequences. The Excelsior news service reported that schools would reopen nationwide by next Tuesday. Schools in some parts of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> reported that they were ready to open today. The Democratic Coordinate struck April 17 to demand union democracy and a 100 percent increase in pay. The teachers, whose take-home pay averages $ 147 a month, rejected the government's initial offer of a 15 percent increase. The strike also led to the ouster of the union's chief, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonguitud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON>, an old-style machine politician close to the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jonguitud </PERSON> and a group of associates had controlled the union for 17 years.

 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> envoys today declared a new truce in a 2-month-old bloodbath in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after rocket and artillery duels between Christian and Syrian gunners killed 20 people and wounded 62. Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who commands 20,000 Christian soldiers fighting an alliance of Syrian and Druse Moslem forces, ordered his gunners to abide by the cease-fire, a spokesman said. There was no immediate public reaction from his foes, but the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> radio station, in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and the Moslem Voice of the Nation, the most popular broadcast in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, quoted `` reliable sources'' as saying the Arab mediators conveyed the cease-fire order to both sides. It was the fifth cease-fire called by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in the current round of fighting, the most desructive of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war All others have collapsed. Thursday's casualties raised the overall toll to 357 people killed and 1,385 wounded since the fighting broke out March 8, by police count. The Arab emissaries, led by <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, an Algerian diplomat, braved shellfire and drove across the dividing <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Line </LOCATION> to east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for a meeting with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> at the bomb-scarred presidential palace in the Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s spokesman, who refused to be further identified, said: `` All roads to the palace were under Syrian shelling. A howitzer shell exploded very close to the palace as the Arab delegates were at the entrance. No one was hurt.'' The mediators met earlier in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government. <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> told reporters after meeting with <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> that they were seeking to `` normalize the situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to allow the committee to pursue its efforts,'' a reference to a six-member Arab League panel entrusted with finding a settlement of the civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s spokesman said Syrian gunners fired `` 126 shells, most of them 240mm mortars, into the palace before the Arab envoys' arrival. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 53, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, had been staying in the bomb shelter of the palace with his wife and three daughters. The Arab envoys arrived in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday after meetings in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> with Syrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharaa </PERSON> and in the east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem. <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> said the meetings Wednesday were `` the first step'' of the new mission. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to a three-point plan declared by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> on April 28. It called for a cease-fire, lifting blockades of sea and air ports and the deployment of 321-man observer team drawn from six Arab countries. But Syrian and Druse gunners kept on shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave, claiming they wanted to prevent three ships from unloading <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> weapons for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The truce collapsed over the weekend when Christian forces began returning fire. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have long been enemies and now are competing for influence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> backs <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who has pledged to fight until <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 soldiers, based in Moslem regions of the country under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate, are withdrawn. The latest confrontation broke out two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by the Moslem militias. The militias deprive the state treasury of about $ 100 million annually in lost customs dues.

 When a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jet carrying a hydrogen bomb rolled off an aircraft carrier into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> feared he and others aboard the Ticonderoga were moments away from death. `` They were very nervous minutes,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said, recalling the long-suppressed accident, which happened in 1965 about 80 miles off a Japanese island and 200 miles from <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>. The bomb mounted under the <ORGANIZATION> A-4 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skyhawk </ORGANIZATION> jet was lost in 16,000 feet of water. `` At the time, my feelings were that if that atomic bomb goes off, this is all going to be vapor _ we're just going to disappear off the face of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' he said in an interview in Wednesday's The -LRB- <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> The pilot and plane also were lost despite the desperate efforts of sailors who clawed at the single-seat attack jet to try to keep it from rolling off the deck. `` The word was passed that they would appreciate it _ they did n't say do n't or anything else _ if you did n't mention it in your letters home and just kind of kept it quiet,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. `` In those days, you more or less did everything you were told. There was a great deal of patriotism on that ship.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the accident earlier this week, and government officials have told <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> they do n't know of any danger posed by the one-megaton H-bomb, which they said had not been armed. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Santee </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, was a 20-year-old bomb handler on the Ticonderoga at the time. The carrier was on a break from war duty and holding a nuclear-weapons loading exercise, he said. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said the pilot had climbed into the cockpit when the carrier listed, sending the jet rolling backward. `` We saw -LRB- the pilot -RRB- look at the handlers as if to say, ` There are no brakes,' or, ` I ca n't reach them,' or something like that,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. When the plane hit the water, the bomb separated from the fuselage, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- It -RRB- was bobbing around with smoke coming out of it _ probably from the batteries,'' before it sank, he said. The Ticonderoga on which <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> served was decommissioned in 1973. Another ship now carries the name.

 Burmese guerrillas killed at least 40 government troops while defending a rebel camp along the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border, rebel sources said today. The Karen rebel sources and students fighting alongside them said at least 45 other soldiers were wounded in Wednesday's fighting at <LOCATION> Wan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kha </LOCATION> Two guerrillas were killed and 12 wounded, they claimed. <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kha </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> across the border from the northern <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> province of Tak. The Karens are among a dozen ethnic-based rebel groups fighting for more autonomy from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s government. The government has intensified its offensive in recent months and seized several major <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> bases along the Thai border. Thai border police today also reported fighting at <LOCATION> Yahjaw </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chikaya </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramat </LOCATION> district, near the border. The police said about 750 Karens have fled the fighting into the <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramat </LOCATION> district of Tak province. On Tuesday, police said, <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> troops crossed into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and looted shops of rice, cooking oil and clothes. In a statement dated May 9 and received in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> today, Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, condemned the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government and called for international mediation to end the fighting. `` We have been heartened by the news that the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> civil war might soon be resolved, but not 300 miles from the battlefields of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> an equally bloody civil war is being fought in tragic obscurity,'' the statement said. `` In <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, a brutal military government which has been condemned by the international community is escalating its war with the armed Burmese opposition,'' it said. `` The war needs mediation. The opposition desires it. Someone, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -RRB- should be able to provide it,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> accused the Burmese army of attacking rebel positions where thousands of students fled after last year's military coup. Students were at the forefront of last year's nationwide campaign for democracy. The army crushed the campaign after the Sept. 18 coup.

<TEXT>
 Only three of the 16 flight attendants aboard <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811, whose side ripped open Feb. 24 and pulled nine passengers to their deaths, have regained their composure enough to return to work. Most of the attendants who worked to protect the remaining 327 passengers in the howling horror of the plane's darkened cabin have not been able to return to work either because of physically or psychologically problems, according to their supervisor. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 landed safely in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> after aborting a flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> gave the plane's pilots and other crew members the Secretary's Heroism Award in ceremonies Wednesday, saying the flight attendants overcame `` the deafening, hurricane-like winds that swept through the cabin'' as they helped passengers deal with the crisis over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said that despite increased concern, air travel remains one of the safest forms of transportation. He blamed news headlines for sometimes creating the impression that aviation is unsafe. But several flight attendants interviewed after the ceremonies were critical of the state of aviation safety and accused <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> of cutting back in training and safety equipment. The company denied the criticism, saying it meets or exceeds all <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> regulations and industry standards. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is continuing its investigation into the incident following a hearing in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> last month. Investigators have focused on a possible malfunction in the locking mechanism of the cargo door that blew off with a large section of the fuselage. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> handed out awards to Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Incline </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; 1st Officer <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Slader </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; 2nd Officer <PERSON> Randal </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; and 13 flight attendants. In a separate meeting, the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airmanship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awards </ORGANIZATION> to the pilot and copilots. Three other flight attendants did not attend the program but were to receive their awards later. <PERSON> Joani </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumbrunnen </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, said they were still recovering from the effects of the incident. She said at least one has refused to fly at all and `` may never fly again'' because of the experience. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lythgoe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kailua-Kona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, who suffered two broken ribs in the incident, said he returned to work only last week and still reacts with newfound anxiety whenever a plane gets into turbulence and during landing and takeoff. Flight Attendant <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, who accepted the award with his arm still in a cast, said a flying liquor cart jammed into him during the flight. <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lythgoe </PERSON> both said passengers and some flight attendants had difficulty putting on life vests, which <PERSON> Lythgoe </PERSON> said he thought were badly designed. <PERSON> Sharol </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> said not enough oxygen bottles or enough megaphones, needed to communicate with passengers above the roar caused by the hole, were readily available to flight attendants. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kailua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, said she does not want to return to work until <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> improves its training for emergencies. She said the airline has `` watered down'' safety procedures and training over the years. Ms. <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON>, who has been flying for 22 years, said attendants used to have to undergo three days of retraining each year, including an open-book test, but now have only an eight-hour session. `` It makes it more difficult because you have to fly by the seat of your pants,'' she said. `` The corporation does n't seem to think safety is cost-effective.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said the airline's No 1 priority is safety. `` Safety is good business,'' she said, noting that although the 747 is required to carry only nine flight attendants, Flight 811 had 15, in addition to one who was flying as a passenger but joined in helping with the emergency and also received an award. She said the airline's training for flight attendants exceeds industry standards, including eight hours of classroom work, four hours of home study and added security training each year. `` The quality of our training has never deteriorated and, in fact, we have enhanced it to improve proficiency over the years,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 County judges have enacted a policy requiring drug offenders to name their suppliers or face additional time in jail for contempt. Some defense attorneys say the measure is unconstitutional. `` Forced and coerced information is suspect, unreliable and potentially dangerous. It raises serious constitutional questions,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncier </PERSON>. The policy violates the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination `` because it could indirectly be used to produce additional charges against the defendant,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, another defense attorney. <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s three <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges adopted the measure Friday at the suggestion of <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, chairman of the area's <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> At least one judge said he would use the policy immediately. In addition, a <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge agreed to use the policy, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. The policy is modeled after one in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, which is used with juvenile offenders, he said. Under the program, people convicted of drug offenses can be jailed for contempt of court for not naming their suppliers. Anyone who wants to plead guilty in exchange for a lesser sentence will be told of the policy. If the defendant refuses to name the supplier, the judge may reject the plea agreement, said Criminal Court Judge <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>.

 Israeli troops killed a 17-year-old Palestinian and wounded three others today, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army confined 700,000 Palestinians to their homes in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> for a fourth day. The teen-ager was reported killed in a stone-throwing clash that erupted as Palestinians staged a general strike in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in memory of their brethren killed in the 17-month-old rebellion against Israeli rule. At least 470 Palestinians and 21 Israelis have died in the uprising. <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>, a daily newspaper, reported that Transport Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsav </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc plans to urge that troops seal off the occupied territories for three months and quash the uprising. A more conciliatory approach came from former Israeli President <PERSON> Efraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzir </PERSON>, who today suggested not ruling out peace talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would n't hasten to do it,'' <PERSON> Katzir </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> in discussing President <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposals to hold elections in the occupied territories and negotiate a peace settlement with victors. `` Only if it -LRB- the election plan -RRB- fails, other paths shourvision of the balloting. Israeli leaders reportedly have been unable to come up with a complete formula for the balloting. Among other problems, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposes participation of the 140,000 Palestinians of east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in elections, said his spokesman, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> of Labor want east Jerusalemites to join the balloting to make the election plan more appealing to Palestinians, said a government official, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> presided over state affairs today from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where he underwent a battery of tests, doctors said Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said the 73-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leader had complained of `` weariness and weakness,'' but he refused to be precise about his condition. Doctors said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would be released Friday. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, violence persisted despite a 4-day-old curfew. Sixty-year-old <PERSON> Farhana </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawarea </PERSON> was struck in the head by a bullet in a clash with soldiers in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, Arab hospital officials said. She was reported in moderate condition.

Two Palestinians were reported wounded in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camp of Nuseirat and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>. The army said it was checking casualty reports. A spokesman also announced that troops captured a group of Palestinians suspected of making homemade guns to shoot at soldiers. They were arrested at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp of Dheishe. The military said they were alerted when a group member suffered a fatal gunshot wound April 15 when a makeshift pistol went off. The spokesman said that at the time, Palestinians claimed soldiers shot the man. In southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> today, several dozen angry Israelis staged a protest on a main highway north of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> over the alleged kidnapping and killing of soldiers by Palestinians. Earlier this week, soldiers discovered the body of one soldier in the area and a search continued for another soldier missing for eight days. Authorities alleged the soldiers were kidnapped by Palestinians.

 Swirling wind deflated and damaged a mammoth, $ 18 million radar balloon used to detect drug smuggling across the Mexican border, but the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says radar coverage continues. The Aerostat was damaged Wednesday while moored at the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huachuca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base, said Customs spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>. A dust devil, or mini tornado, struck the helium balloon, which has sophisticated look-down radar, he said. The 6 -LCB- - ton balloon crashed to the ground No one was injured and there was no damage to other property. The extent of damage to the balloon was not immediately known, but <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said, `` Certainly it can function again. I'm pretty sure of that.'' A second Aerostat is at <LOCATION> Deming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, with another scheduled to go into operation at <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> next month. The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> plans six over the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> and four over the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Partial overlapping coverage provided by the Aerostat in <LOCATION> Deming </LOCATION> plus radar at military installations, air traffic control sites and Customs ground and airborne stations will help make up for the downed balloon, <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said. The Aerostat, deployed in June, is 245 feet long and 72 feet in diameter with a hull of high-tech, highly resistant, thin materials. The Aerostat was moored close to the ground because of strong wind before the accident, <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said, and there was speculation debris in the dust devil damaged the balloon.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is coming to make history. The Chinese, ever wary of their northern neighbor, are determined that history will not be repeated. Expectations differ as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, meet for the first Chinese-Soviet summit since <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> the cold shoulder in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1959. Both sides agree that the May 15-18 summit will normalize political and party relations strained three decades ago when <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> challenged <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s right to dominate the world Communist movement. Both desire an easing of tensions so they can concentrate on their sputtering efforts to reform plodding, state-controlled economies. `` Abnormal relations'' along their 4,300 - mile border `` are not in the interest of the people of the two countries,'' Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> recently said The summit will give impetus to growing trade relations, particularly across border outposts, and to joint efforts in the development of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and northeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It will mean more official contacts. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be able to better study <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s pioneer efforts in market-oriented reforms. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, now challenged by a pro-democracy student movement, will get a better look at the bold political reforms <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has initiated. There will be more consultations on <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where both support the Communist north, and on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, where Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is battling Chinese-backed guerrillas. Students who have demonstrated for democratic reforms also plan to take advantage of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit. Leaders of the movement today announced they would have a separate `` welcoming ceremony'' for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and invite him to speak on political reform in his country. `` We have not ruled out a demonstration to express our support for political reform,'' said one activist, who has helped lead seven marches since mid-April for democracy and a free press. The Chinese have been decidedly cool to the idea that the summit is another triumph for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of international detente. It remains to be seen, one Chinese scholar wrote in the official <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Review </LOCATION>, `` whether the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can thoroughly correct its deep-rooted big-nation chauvinism and hegemonism under the guidance of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s new thinking.'' The Chinese say normalization of relations is important, but so is winning concessions from the Soviets, especially on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Chinese leaders insist that improved relations will not mean a return to the alliance of the 1950s, when <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s fledgling Communist government was forced to bow to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s ideological dictums. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s disputes with <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, and then with <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, led to an irrevocable split in 1960 when the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> withdrew all its technicians from Chinese factories built with Soviet aid. Soviet `` revisionism'' was reviled by the ultra-leftists of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. After border clashes broke out in 1969, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> asked the nation to prepare for all-out war. War was averted, but prospects for better relations after the Cultural Revolution were quashed by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and by Soviet military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> at the end of 1979. Political normalization talks were started in 1982, but went nowhere because of what <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> calls the `` three obstacles'' _ <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and Soviet troops on the Chinese border. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has pushed hard for the summit. He finally started getting a positive response from the Chinese last year after announcing the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, reducing Soviet troops on the border and agreeing to help get <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. But as Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> recently stressed, there is still `` some way to go and some efforts to be made'' before the obstacles are eliminated. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 84 and semi-retired, apparently agreed to the summit because he wanted to cap his career with a diplomatic tour de force equal to his restoring diplomatic ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1979 and the 1984 agreement with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on returning <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Chinese insist, however, that hard bargaining on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> will take place at the summit. Already clashes reportedly have occurred over the joint communique to be issued at the end of the visit. The Soviets want to lay down general principles on future relations. The Chinese are demanding Soviet commitments on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected to meet <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> on Tuesday, and he will meet representatives of Chinese society and visit <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> before leaving May 18.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s top assistant resigned today, a week after a newspaper published the story of a woman whom he had beaten and left for dead 16 years ago. `` I wish I could rewrite the past, but unfortunately I ca n't,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, who had the title of executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and served as <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s chief legislative strategist <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who is in the midst of defending himself against charges of unethical behavior in his personal finances, accepted <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s resignation `` with sadness and regret. In a statement, the speaker said he never regretted giving `` this young man another chance.'' In 1973, when he was 19, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> was the manager of an imported household furnishings store in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb when he attacked a female customer with a hammer, stabbed and slashed her with a steak knife, and left her for dead in the back seat of her car. Doctors said it was a miracle the woman recovered. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> was convicted of malicious wounding and served 27 months of a 15 year sentence. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> was <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s daughter's brother-in-law at the time, and the speaker offered him a clerk's job upon his release. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> rose to become <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s closest aide, as the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressman himself climbed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ranks to become speaker in 1987. Although <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s record was known to many on Capitol Hill, and several articles had been written in recent years about the case, the story caused a great stir last week. The story about <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> came in the midst of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s own battle against charges that he has repeatedly violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules. The Washington Post printed the victim's story with prominent display in its Style section. <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> recounted the gruesome ordeal in great detail and said <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> had never apologized for the crime. In his statement of resignation, released by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office today, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said he was `` and will always be full of remorse. `` To <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, and also to my family, all I can say now is what I have said many times before and to myself every day since this happened. And that is I am sorry. Truly sorry.'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said he had considered leaving the speaker's office and his $ 89,500-a-year job since last December. `` But now it's time to leave,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, in his statement, said he had hired <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> as a mail clerk on the recommendation of law enforcement officials and of his daughter, who had known <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> in high school. `` I was told he had served some 27 months upon conviction of a crime, but was not told the details of the crime,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` My heart goes out to the young woman who was the victim of that crime so many years ago, and I wish there were something I might do to be of benefit to her,'' he said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s press secretary, said <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> told <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of his decision late Wednesday. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> just decided that he did not want to become an issue,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Presidency Member Criticizes Detentions of 200 Ethnic Albanians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Yugoslav official denounced the detentions of more than 200 ethnic Albanians who he says were jailed without charge in the troubled province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> newspaper reported today. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> Vrhovec, <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>'s representative on the collective nine-man state presidency, as cautioning that holding citizens without charge is legal only `` in certain difficult situations.'' <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is a province in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> that has been plagued by violence involving the ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> majority and the Slav minority. The province has been under a state of emergency since March riots that killed at least 25 people. Vrhovec's statement, to parliamentary deputies in <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, criticized the police action. However, as a member of the presidency, he has played a role in the crackdown. `` The isolation in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> represents the most flagrant, the most radical form of limiting human rights,'' Vrhovec said, according to <LOCATION> Borba </LOCATION>. The newspaper is considered among the most liberal of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s state-controlled media. Police reports say 60,000 ethnic Albanians rioted to protest constitutional changes giving <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> more control to police <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where 85 percent of the 1.8 million inhabitants are ethnic Albanians. Previously, the province enjoyed virtual self-rule within the federation. Serbian authorities claim the amendments were needed to prevent alleged harassment of Slavs by ethnic Albanians. Opponents of <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> accuse him of distorting the ethnic situation to exert control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and elevate himself among Serbs, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest ethnic group. About 800 protesters have been jailed following the March violence, most receiving 60-day prison sentences. Among those awaiting trial are Albanian politicians, businessmen and other community leaders accused of instigating the troubles. A commentary in the current issue of <LOCATION> Danas </LOCATION>, the country's largest-selling news magazine, said detainees are not allowed to receive visits by lawyers or family members and are denied books and newspapers Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> authorities have demanded an unspecified number of ethnic Albanian regional deputies be ousted for opposing the constitutional changes and voting against official Serbian-backed candidates for the regional presidency. `` It is unacceptable to have in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s assembly a certain number of deputies whose behavior and statements are contrary to the policies of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' the magazine quoting <PERSON> Daut </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasanica </PERSON>, a high-ranking provincial official, as saying. In the liberal northern republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, meanwhile, thousands of students boycotted classes today to protest the jailing of a journalist accused of revealing military secrets. About half of <ORGANIZATION> Ljubljana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s 17,000 students protested, student union member <PERSON> Sereja </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorli </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON>, editor of the liberal <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON> youth weekly, two other journalists and an army soldier were sentenced by a <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> military court to prison terms of 10 months to four years for theft and possession of a classified army document.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> met senior statesman <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> today but failed to persuade the reform-minded politician to succeed him when he steps down over an influence-peddling scandal, sources said. Local news reports said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, a former foreign minister, are at odds over <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>'s call for an end to party factions. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, in naming his terms for leading the scandal-tainted party and becoming <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s next prime minister, also has demanded the resignations of all party officials connected to corruption cases. After meeting more than three hours today, the two <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders said their discussions focused on reform of the party, whose popular support has been deeply eroded by the so-called Recruit scandal. `` My feeling has not changed,'' <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> said. `` I believe Mr. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has n't got a good impression'' of the conditions under which he would accept the country's top post. Though <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was expected to ask <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> to accept the party presidency, he told reporters after the meeting: `` We entered today's talks after confirming between each other that I'm not in a position to make any request today.'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> leads the largest of six major factions that make up the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Balancing factional strength is an important factor in determining appointments to the Cabinet and has become a widely accepted feature of the ruling party organization. Political fundraising _ a key issue in the current scandal _ is a major part of factional competition. The discredited prime minister has admitted receiving more than $ 1 million in donations from the information conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and announced April 25 he will resign to take responsibility for the loss of public trust. `` Revolutionary changes in the party's way of thinking are needed,'' Itotold reporters Tuesday. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, 75 and diabetic, has rejected a series of informal offers to replace <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, citing his age and poor health. But party leaders appear ready to negotiate with him because he is one of a handful of senior politicians untainted by the scandal, which also involved insider trading. Three of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s Cabinet ministers have resigned and 14 businessmen and ex-bureaucrats have been arrested for bribery or other charges related to the affair.

 A scientist claims to produce nuclear fusion in a jar at room temperature. But few believe him, and his application for a patent is rejected. The story may sound familiar, but it happened in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> in 1927, more than a half-century before two researchers stunned the scientific world with a similar experiment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tandberg </PERSON>'s experiments `` seemingly were very similiar to the ones performed in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bertil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON> of the fusion research department at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's amazing that his findings have been completely forgotten for 60 years,'' said <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON>, whose father worked on the project and kept notes. <PERSON> Tandberg </PERSON> began looking into cold fusion in 1927 when the 33-year-old chief scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> became intrigued with fusion experiments being conducted in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON> said. Two <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> researchers who were trying to produce helium for airships said they fused hydrogen into helium using a palladium catalyst. But later they discovered errors that forced them to retract their claim of fusion. `` The German scientists were n't interested in producing energy, since the world's energy sources seemed inexhaustable at the time,'' <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON> said. `` But <PERSON> Tandberg </PERSON> immediately realized the energy aspect of the experiment and its potential importance,'' <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON> said in an interview. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Registration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> refused to accept <PERSON> Tandberg </PERSON>'s application to record his experiment. `` Their experts claimed it was impossible to release nuclear energy through cold fusion,'' <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON> said. Soon afterward, <PERSON> Tandberg </PERSON> ended his fusion research and dedicated himself to other fields. He later left <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION>, still one of the world's largest makers of home appliances, and became a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In March, <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>'s chemistry department, and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, announced they achieved cold fusion that produced up to 50 times the amount of energy they put into their experiment Their findings were met with incredulity. The latest scientist seeking to explain away their claims, Nobel laureate Dr. <PERSON> Linus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauling </PERSON>, suggested chemical reactions, not fusion, could have produced the heat. <PERSON> Pauling </PERSON>, 88, of the <ORGANIZATION> Linus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pauling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said in a letter published today in the British science magazine Nature that the palladium would have combined with deuterium heavy water to form palladium deuteride, which is unstable. `` After the beginning of electrolysis, this unstable deuteride may begin to decompose either slowly, resulting in an increased liberation of heat, or explosively, as <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> observed,'' wrote <PERSON> Pauling </PERSON>, who won the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1954. But, if they are right, it could open the way to a cheap, inexhaustible way to create energy in the same way that the sun and stars produce heat and light. Fusion derives its energy from forcing atoms of deuterium or hydrogen together. The reaction produces an atom of helium, a burst of energy and a neutron. The work of <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> `` bears a strong resemblance to the way <PERSON> Tandberg </PERSON> carried out his experiments, according to my father's notes,'' <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON>'s father wrote a book on <PERSON> Tandberg </PERSON> describing the experiment. `` The book was never translated and was forgotten a long time ago,'' he said, which helped explain why the work stirred so little interest among contemporary scientists. <PERSON> Tandberg </PERSON>, who died in 1968, apparently never withdrew his claim of having produced cold fusion. Like <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleishmann </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tandberg </ORGANIZATION> used palladium electrodes placed in deuterium-rich heavy water, <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON> said. According to the notes, the experiment produced helium and energy. `` But in those days it was n't possible to record whether the reaction produced more energy than was used to initiate it,'' <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON> said. There is no evidence that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> researchers knew of the experiments in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafelski </PERSON>, working on a fusion research team at <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, was in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> last month to report on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experiments. `` He seemed amazed to find that cold fusion attempts were performed all those years ago,'' <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON> said.

 Police smashed into a barricaded campus building today and arrested 35 people protesting military research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>. Five others were arrested outside, a school spokeswoman said. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, black students demanding more minority students and faculty continued a sit-in at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and 25 people were arrested in a student-government dispute at <ORGANIZATION> Fresno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The UMass protest, which began Tuesday, was the fifth such takeover at the 25,000-student school in three weeks. Those in the building were charged with trespassing, and five others were arrested for trying block a bus carrying away the protesters, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. The Faculty Senate scheduled a special meeting for this afternoon to discuss military research. `` There is a strong feeling among some people that it is an issue of academic freedom,'' said <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules committee. `` But others point out that we have already imposed some limits on what research may be done on campus. We have prohibitions against using human subjects and doing classified or any other research that can not be made public.'' The wave of occupations began April 19 with a sit-in at a laboratory and resulted in 111 arrests. `` This is the first time they've barricaded the doors,'' said school spokeswoman <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>. `` Before, even the police were allowed in as observers.'' In East Lansing, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, 200-300 blacks held <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s administration building in a protest that began Tuesday. `` We are here as long as it takes. We are here to stay until this is over,'' a leader, <PERSON> Darius </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON>, told the students. <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> said the students want more black hiring and recruitment and appointment of a minority adviser to the provost. In <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, university police Wednesday ended a two-day sit-in in the student government office at <ORGANIZATION> Fresno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> by members of a liberal campus party. The protest disrupted a meeting on bylaws changes. The liberals accused the conservative student administration of sexism and racism for seeking changes they said would dilute power of the top two elective positions, which will be held next year by women, one of them Hispanic.

 A member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer team that visited <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> said today there are `` disturbing parallels'' between <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> before last weekend's election and the voting scheduled for next February in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` Having just returned from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> our reflections are fresh, and the lessons we have drawn have important applicability to develoments in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuette </PERSON> told the privately financed <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> and Fair Elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schuette </PERSON> is president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which, with its Democratic counterpart, sponsored the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> observer team headed by former Presidents <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. The balloting was branded as fraudulent by observers and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` Our experience in observing a variety of elections around the world is that the quality and intention of an electoral law is but one element of the critical determinants of whether an election will be free and fair,'' <PERSON> Schuette </PERSON> said. `` The other two points of analysis are the caliber and organization of the opposition and the over-all organization of government.'' `` There are disturbing parallels, too frequent to be considered accidental, between these three elements in the cases of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` My own analysis of the current environment _ and I should note that the Republican institute has just concluded a seminar in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> with opposition parties on the electoral process _ is that sufficient freedom of organization, expression and activity does not currently exist to ensure a free and fair election,'' he said. On Wednesday, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration reserves the right to seek renewed military aid to the Contra rebels if the Sandinista regime holds power by fraudulent means in next year's election. `` If it is perceived that they have stolen the election, then our policy subsequently will reflect that,'' <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> Counselor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> told the conservative-backed <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> and Fair Elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` The wider this perception, then the stronger consensus there will be for an appropriate policy afterward,'' <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> said. The official was asked his reaction to the testimony of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, who told the privately funded group on Tuesday he would favor `` significant military aid'' to the Contras if Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> fails to hold free elections as promised. `` I have nothing to add to what was part of the bipartisan accord a couple of months ago, that the administration does reserve the right to ask for such aid in the future if circumstances change,'' <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> said. `` That's not part of our present policy, but the administration has not given away its future right to ask for such things if it seems appropriate.'' The bipartisan agreement, reached in the face of congressional resistance to administration requests for immediate military aid to the Contras, calls for continued non-lethal aid only. Asked by former Sen. <PERSON> Gaylord </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, D-Wis., commission co-chairman, what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy would be if a fair election resulted in an Ortega victory, <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> replied: `` I hesitate to prejudge everything we would do I think there is a presumption that if there is a fair election and we accept it as a fair election, that makes a big difference in our attitude toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and certainly our policy.'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a private grant-making organization that receives an appropriation from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, testified that the Nicaraguan election process `` will not work, and indeed will be a farce, if there is not concerted effort by the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents and by others who are concerned about the situation to insist upon fair rules.'' `` So far, the fear is that there have been certain cosmetic steps that have been taken, perhaps to improve the standing of the government in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere, but that there has not been any real effort to sit down and establish an agreement,'' <PERSON> Gershman </PERSON> said. `` Unless there is agreement on rules, it will undermine the legitimacy of the whole process.'' Elections are to be held in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> next February under an agreement <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> made with the governments of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.

 A lawyer for an Indian tribe that gets 94 percent of its income from oil royalties complained today that the three federal agencies in charge of protecting Indian wells from theft are ineffective. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipps </PERSON>, attorney for the Southern Ute tribe, said putting a request for action to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> is like throwing it into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Triangle </LOCATION>, where legend says boats mysteriously disappear. He singled out the <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> as making so many compromises with industry over the years that it no longer effectively protects the Indian owners of oil wells. <PERSON> Shipps </PERSON> testimony came during an investigative hearing by a special panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs that has been probing theft of Indian oil and underpayment of their royalties. <PERSON> Shipps </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utes </ORGANIZATION> have been supervising their own oil wells for the last 10 years. He and others urged the committee to grant more management power to the tribes. The panel's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., on Wednesday blasted the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> for what he called `` benign neglect. It's `` unbelievable,'' said <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>. `` An ` I do n't care' attitude An ` I do n't give a damn' attitude. I hope someone loses their job.'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>'s comments came after a day of testimony by <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> officials about their work in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. He became particularly angry during the hearing when <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, supervisor for inspection and enforcement technicians of the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, said he did n't call the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> about theft in the oil fields because he could n't find the phone number. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> waved a telephone book over his head. `` You could n't find the phone number?'' he bellowed. `` I'll show you where the phone number is. It's right in the front of the book.'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, deputy assistant director of energy and mineral resources with the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Do you think Mr. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, who ca n't find the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> phone number, is meeting his responsibility?'' the senator asked. When <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he thought the agency's inspection force was fulfilling its charge to the Indians, <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> raised his voice even further. `` That's no more meeting the responsibility than I'm an astronaut, and I'm not an astronaut,'' he shouted. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> tried again. `` I talked to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 and got no response,'' he said, saying he left his name and number with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> but did n't get a call back and then never tried to reach the agency again. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he thought <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> had made a satisfactory attempt. The testimony Wednesday concentrated on <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, although the committee's probe extends to all states where Indians have wells. Earlier, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, district manager of the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, told investigators for the committee that anyone who wanted to steal oil could do it because of the remoteness of wells on Indian lands. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnell </PERSON>, special agent with the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, said the problem was further complicated by confusion over who could make arrests when stealing is discovered. He said no one in the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> has the authority to do so on Indian land. Nine inspectors in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> are responsible for about 5,000 wells, of which about 3,000 are Indian, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. He presented documents showing that in eight years the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> had discovered theft of $ 20,490 worth of oil. This also drew strong criticism from the committee, which has discovered millions of dollars worth of theft in the six months it's been investigating stealing in the oil fields. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Elroy </PERSON>, who has been assigned to the special committee, said, `` Give me a staff the size of the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> and two years and I'd come back with a truckload of indictments.''

 A woman whose daughters died three years apart under mysterious circumstances arrived at court today to appear before a grand jury, one day after burying the second infant next to the firstborn's unmarked grave. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> are the primary suspects in the suffocation of <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, whom they reported abducted on April 29, investigators said. Their firstborn, <LOCATION> Loralei </LOCATION>, died under nearly identical circumstances. Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, 29, and four relatives arrived at the <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courthouse in <LOCATION> Edwardsville </LOCATION> today to face a grand jury. Her husband, 37, was not subpoenaed. Police say <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> told them that he believed his wife accidentally killed <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> and <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>. The Simses, accompanied by more than a dozen family members, attended a private half-hour funeral service for <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> on Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethalto </LOCATION>. The infant, whose body was found in a trash can on the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> side of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on May 3, was buried in nearby <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION>. Two police detectives stood about 150 feet from the cemetery where they shot photographs and scribbled notes. At the church, the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> urged reporters and photographers to stay far away from the building `` out of respect for the baby.'' <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s body was in a tiny white coffin, and an employee of the Gray Funeral Home in <LOCATION> Wood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> served as the lone pallbearer. The <PERSON> Simses </PERSON> held hands as they walked into the church. Cemetery manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Helvie </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Simses </PERSON> requested that <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> be buried next to the unmarked grave of their firstborn daughter, <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>, who was 13 days old when they reported her abducted on June 17, 1986. The <PERSON> Simses </PERSON> seem `` just like normal parents to me,'' <PERSON> Helvie </PERSON> said as he dug <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s grave Wednesday morning. `` That's why it's hard to believe all that's going on.'' <PERSON> Helvie </PERSON> recalled that the <PERSON> Simses </PERSON> visited the other child's grave several times and put flowers there. Remains believed to be <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>'s were found near the <PERSON> Simses </PERSON>' home in nearby <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> _ where the couple was living at the time _ about a week after the couple reported her abducted The case was never solved, though the couple are suspects in her death also, <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities said. The <PERSON> Simses </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Groshong </PERSON> of <PERSON> Alton </PERSON>, had no comment Wednesday. He said earlier that the <PERSON> Simses </PERSON> denied any wrongdoing.

 The head of a generic-drug company told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today that the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is retaliating against his company for having started an investigation into alleged bribery at the agency. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Mylan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, testified to a a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommitttee that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is holding up approvals of the company's products because `` this was one way to retaliate.'' `` Discriminatory treatment or wholly unjustified inaction continues to be the rule rather than the exception'' at the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s generic drug division, <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., the subcommittee chairman, said he will inform <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> personally `` that any retaliation by any <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> employee against the firms or individuals who testify before us will not be tolerated. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> also said he will ask <PERSON> Young </PERSON> to explain the steps he will take to assure that <ORGANIZATION> Mylan </ORGANIZATION> and other companies testifying before the subcommittee will not be discriminated against by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said of the retaliation charge, `` No one has had a chance to look into that.'' He also said the agency has asked the inspector general for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to audit the management and supervisory practices of the generic drug division. Nearly a year ago, <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> took his complaints about arbitrary and discriminatory treatment by <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> generic-drug officials and his allegation that bribes and payoffs were being accepted by <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> employees to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee. The panel began an inquiry and turned over its evidence to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> for a criminal investigation. So far, two <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> employees and a drug company executive have been charged in a wide-ranging investigation. More charges are expected. `` You would think that news like this and the increased scrutiny the division has faced as a result of this subcommittee's investigation would produce a new atmosphere at the generic-drug division,'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said `` On the contrary, the agency's response has been business as usual.'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said his company has been trying for more than 18 months to get <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval to make several drug products at its new plant in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The company already has approval to make the drugs at its <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, plant, he said He said the company was told by an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> employee `` that we would never get approvals for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>.'' The employee, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kletch </PERSON>, appeared before the subcommittee under subpoena last week but exercised his Fifth Amendment right and declined to answer any questions. Investigators have said that while the investigation has turned up serious problems with the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s process for approving generic drugs, they have found no evidence that unsafe or ineffective drugs have been put on the market. Generic drug sales amount to $ 8.9 billion annually. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, a former generic-drug division supervisor who has been charged with taking bribes, said in an affidavit submitted to the subcommittee that favoritism was common in the division. Special handling of applications resulted partly from pressure by the larger, more sophisticated companies, said <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, a key figure in the investigation. Favoritism that helped speed the processing of applications, he said, `` was not necessarily the result of illegal behavior, but reflected, in part, highly personal, arbitrary and often arrogant management.'' He also referred in the document to examples of special treatment and said they `` were the result of continuous pressure put on the division, at all levels, by the industry through lobbying, conducted by executives, lawyers, consultants, and occasionally through political channels inside and outside the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> was charged earlier this week in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> with two counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering. He was accused of accepting a free trip to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and furniture as bribes from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Therapeutics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, generic drug manufacturer. He has agreed to plead guilty and has been cooperating with investigators, said his attorney, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibowitz </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The DuPont Plaza Hotel in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, has agreed to pay about $ 100 million to settle lawsuits stemming from the New Year's Eve 1986 fire that killed 97 people, newspapers reported today. The Telegram of <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and The <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Courant attributed the figure to unidentified sources today. The Star Tribune of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> quoted <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fetterly </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> lawyer for the hotel, as saying the settlement would be substantially less than the $ 200 million in settlements from the 1980 MGM Hotel fire in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. A former hotel maintenance worker pleaded guilty to setting the DuPont Plaza fire during a labor dispute at the 22-story hotel, which was packed with almost 1,000 tourists. More than 140 people were injured. About 2,300 plaintiffs sued for a total of $ 1.8 billion. The hotel was cited for 25 violations by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, including lack of emergency exits from the casino, where 84 victims died. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieder </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> law firm represents the families of the nine <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> people killed in the blaze, confirmed Wednesday that a settlement had been reached, but he refused to discuss the amount. The agreement, reached Tuesday, is subject to approval by two federal judges, the newspapers said. <PERSON> Fettery </PERSON> said if the agreement is approved, about 170 defendants, including those who provided furnishings and services in the hotel, still would have claims against them.

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, under fire for his enforcement of farm chemical rules, would lose much of his power to regulate pesticide use under legislation passed by the House today. The legislation sets up a pesticide regulatory board headed by the commissioner, meaning he will be only one of six votes. The board, consisting of experts in chemistry, agriculture, public health and the environment, would take `` emotionalism and politicism'' out of pesticide regulation, said Rep. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, a Democrat. The measure was an amendment to a bill extending the life of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. State departments and agencies must undergo a review every 12 years and are abolished unless the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> decides to keep them. The amendment was approved 88-54 on Wednesday after a bitter debate. The overall bill goes back to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for consideration of the amendment. `` This is an amendment that hurts farmers. It helps chemical companies. It weakens the pesticide protections of the people of the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, a Democrat, has been criticized by some farm and chemical groups for enforcement of pesticide regulations and for advocating the sale of hormone-free beef to <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries that want it. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, the state's biggest agriculture group, has even urged abolition of the elected commissioner post in favor of an appointed panel.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> today rejected Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposa to negotiate _ and unilaterally reduce _ short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rejection `` seriously concerns us.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> rebuffed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer in an unexpectedly long, 3 -LCB- - hour <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> meeting the secretary later described as a `` rather extensive and in-depth discussion. He told reporters and he and the Soviets had `` agreed that we would continue to disagree agreeably on this.'' The secretary said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not negotiate cutbacks in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Lance </LOCATION> missiles because <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> believes the weapons have served as an effective deterrent to the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, meeting separately with reporters, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a `` crucially important conversation,'' had made `` a most important proposal ... concerning reductions in Soviet tactical nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a comprehensive resolution of this question.'' In rejecting the offer, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had taken a `` very negative position'' and added, `` This seriously concerns us.'' `` The proposals made by Comrade <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> contain some unilateral measures covering the reduction of tactical nuclear arsenals in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had complained that the missiles could be used to deliver a first strike and that modernizing the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> stocks _ which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has proposed _ would destabilize <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer of reductions appeared aimed at pressuring <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> into dropping plans to modernize its 88 Lance missiles, most of which are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies must unilaterally reduce what it says is an advantage of 12-1 in tactical missiles before <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> can consider beginning negotiations. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said both sides had agreed not to discuss the contents of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal, but it would be published in the Soviet press Friday. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> did not propose discussions on short-range missiles, which have a range up to 300 miles, as part of negotiations on reducing conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had, however, made unspecified offers to discuss conventional force reductions at talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. On a more upbeat note, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the two superpowers would resume talks next month on long-range nuclear weapons and a nuclear test ban. He announced that negotiations on longer-range, strategic nuclear weapons, recessed last year, would resume between June 12 and 19. He also said talks with the Soviets on a nuclear test ban would start June 26. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met with reporters before flying to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, to tell the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> about his two days of talks, his first visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> itself is embroiled in a dispute over the missiles. Despite strong resistance from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is insisting on <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> talks that would reduce the weapons. Most of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 88 Lance misiles are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> appeared to rule out the possibility that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would hold their first summit meeting soon. `` We agreed that we would further discuss that issue at the next ministerial -LRB- meeting -RRB- minister <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and I have, probably in September,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. American secretaries of state and Soviet foreign ministers traditionally meet in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> each fall at the start of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> sessions. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the Kremlin for about 3 -LCB- hours, 90 minutes longer than scheduled, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that in the meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, which ran 90 minutes longer than planned, he gave the Soviet president a letter from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressing `` the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's broad view on how they want Soviet-U.S. relations to develop.'' The letter also referred to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> chief's wide-ranging overhaul of Soviet society domestic policy. According to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, it `` emphasized in the strongest terms our wish to see perestroika succeed.'' On other issues, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the Soviets gave <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials a list of people who will be allowed to emigrate. The secretary had met Wednesday with a group of dissidents and Jewish refuseniks, people not allowed to emigrate, telling them <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would `` keep up the pressure to resolve individual cases.'' The <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> also figured prominently in <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s two day of talks. `` We think there may be a fair amount of common ground to our approaches to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters. `` We talked about the idea of giving elections a chance.'' That was a reference to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal for elections in the Israeli-occupied territories The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has called the plan an attempt by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to gain time to crush the 18-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. During a picture-taking session in the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s St. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of the Grand Kremlin Palace before beginning his talks with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said: `` Everything will be on the right road.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> then returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> guest house to sign an agreement with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on cooperation in combating pollution in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> and Chukchi seas in emergencies.

 Hitching 40 Belgian horses to one wagon is like killing a mosquito with a bazooka, but <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON> says that's beside the point. `` It's the spectacle of the thing,'' he said. The original 40-horse hitches were developed at the turn of the century to advertise the circus and at the time, he said, `` It was the most spectacular thing they could do.'' Sparrow is putting together a modern version of the big hitch, and the Zearing farmer says it's still spectacular. `` Sometimes I almost get mind boggled by it,'' he said. `` I wonder, am I in over my head?'' After months of training the animals, <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON> gave them a practice spin today on a 300-acre plot on the Sparrow farm. `` It went off real well,'' said his wife, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON> said the last time family attempted a 40-horse hitch was in 1977, when his father, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, did it. Since then, sponsoring money ran out, the Sparrows sold the animals and went back to farming. `` We went all over the country, Rose Bowl, coast to coast,'' said the son. Now, thanks to a $ 120,000 grant from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Sparrows assembled a new team. The grant covers expenses of training and transportation to the only planned public appearance, the Great Circus Parade in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> in July. <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON>, 34, said it takes patience and practice to arrange the animals correctly. `` It's like assembling a football team,'' he said. `` Some animals are interchangeable and some are n't.'' Hauling the wagon takes just a fraction of the horsepower available, meaning there's more than enough energy to cause trouble, <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON> said, especially in a crowd. `` There's no way you can make them crowd proof, but you do the best you can.'' <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON> said the animals are trained to think nothing of it when a balloon pops nearby or a band blares or a car horn sounds. `` When you stop, you have to stand there and not get spooked,'' he said. `` We drive right up to them in cars with the horn blaring.'' <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON> said he can shout loud enough for the lead animals, 115 feet away, to hear the commands, but the hitch requires two pairs of mounted outriders as well. One pair flanks the lead animals and the other is midway. `` We had a 4-year-old one time who darted right toward the hitch and would have gone under if it had n't been for one of the outriders cutting him off,'' <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON> said. What if an animal midway in the pack wants to bolt right and the command is to hang a gradual left? Not to fear, he said, the other horses will provide the correct influence. `` If one horse does n't want to turn, the others will push him and he wo n't have any choice.''

 A spring frost in eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> will mean fewer bottles of bubbly in 1989, the Champagne producers association said Thursday. The group said it could not yet put a precise figure on how much production would be affected by the late chilling of the Champagne region, although about one-fourth of the vines were hit by the cold. In some areas, practically all the vines were affected and it seemed likely that some vineyards would produce very few grapes, the growers said. Vineyards in the Champagne region are hit by damaging spring frosts about one out of every three years, they said.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Show Lackluster Increase, Evidence of Slowdown in Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Retail sales rose by a lackluster 0.4 percent in April, the government said Thursday in a report cited by analysts as evidence that higher interest rates are taking a toll on economic growth. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted $ 139.9 billion last month after remaining flat in March and falling 0.4 percent in February. `` The last three months' sales were up 5 percent over the same period last year, barely keeping pace with inflation,'' said economist Lawrence A. Hunter of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` Today's report is another clear sign that the economy has slowed far more than most analysts realize.'' Economists had expected a much stronger rebound in April, anticipating a surge of between 1 percent and 2 percent on the strength of higher auto sales. Car-buying did increase for the first time since November _ it was up 1.1 percent following declines of 0.5 percent and 1.8 percent _ but the gain amounted to only about half of what was predicted. Auto sales have been hit particularly hard by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy of pushing up interest rates to fight inflation, as have housing-related items such as hardware, building supplies and furniture. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was hoping was to cool off consumer spending while we still had an expansion led by -LRB- business investment -RRB- spending and exports, and it looks like it's going the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> way,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer. Bond prices, which move up as interest rates move down, rose slightly in trading after the release of the sales report. Still, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and other analysts said retail spending is not so weak as to push the economy into a recession. Retail spending accounts for about one-third of overall economic activity and is closely watched as a measure of overall growth. Excluding the automotive category, sales rose a sluggish 0.2 percent last month after inching up 0.1 percent in March and falling 0.1 percent in February. `` I do n't see a recession in these numbers,'' said economist <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the economy is slowing, but only in selected areas.'' The bright spots in the report were sales at department stores and specialty clothing shops, buoyed by a long-awaited rebound in sales of women's clothing. Purchases at general merchandise and department store were up 1.0 percent following a 0.1 percent gain in March. Clothing stores reported a large 3.6 percent gain last month, compared with a 0.5 percent drop a month earlier. It was the biggest jump since February 1987. `` They must be jumping up and down and breaking out champagne bottles,'' said economist <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm. `` That industry has been depressed for so long.'' <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> said women's clothing appears to be recovering from a two-year slump caused by rising import prices and the failure of merchandisers to offer styles appropriate for women to wear to work. Sales of durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years, rose only 0.1 percent in April after falling 0.9 percent in March. Sales of non-durable goods, meanwhile, rose 0.6 percent following a 0.5 percent rise. Other categories reporting sales increases in April were gasoline stations, 2.2 percent; and food and grocery stores, 0.7 percent. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, an economic consultant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the rise in gasoline sales is attributable to price increases. Categories posting declines included: building supply and hardware stores, 0.5 percent; furniture stores, 1.2 percent; bars and restaurants, 0.9 percent, and drug stores, 1.6 percent.

 During his trial, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> contradicted the sworn testimony of a longtime <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide who says he did n't find out until August 1986 that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was assisting the Contras. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, the president's nominee to be ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, will face questions about the Iran-Contra affair at a confirmation hearing Friday before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who was convicted of three of 12 charges last week, testified during his trial that he spoke to <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> in 1985 about the efforts of a retired <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent named <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> working in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to assist an air re-supply operation to the Contras. Did National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> `` know about Mr. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s mission?'' prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked North. `` Yes, I believe he did,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified. `` In fact, I believe that once I had talked to Mr. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> about it, I talked to Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> about it, about the fact that he would be able to assist in that country.'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> testified in a sworn deposition to the congressional Iran-Contra committees in 1987 that he did not know until an August 1986 meeting with <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was helping facilitate the movement of weapons and other lethal aid to the Contras. In his courtroom testimony, <PERSON> North </PERSON> did not say precisely when he told <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> about <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s mission, but <PERSON> North </PERSON> was responding to prosecutors' questions about a Sept. 20, 1985, letter he wrote to <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. The `` Dear Felix'' letter says <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> should approach two high Salvadoran military officers asking for space at <LOCATION> Ilopango </LOCATION> air base to service planes being used to supply the Contra rebels. At the time, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> were preparing false responses to congressional inquiries by denying that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff was assisting the Contras. One of the responses said that <PERSON> North </PERSON> did not use his influence to facilitate movement of supplies to the Contas. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked <PERSON> North </PERSON> whether he showed <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> a copy of the letter to <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> at the time. `` I do n't recall ... but as I indicated a moment ago I was put in touch with Mr. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> by Mr. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> of the vice president's staff I mean, he is the person who introduced me to the man,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said from the witness stand. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official, was then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration He and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> had been friends since working together in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> never mentioned his work with the Contra resupply operation until Aug. 8, 1986. Even then, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he did n't pass along to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s complaints about the way the operation was being run. When North's Contra-supply network began to unravel after a plane was shot down over <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Oct. 5, 1986, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> told reporters he had never talked with <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> about the rebels. He later corrected his statement, saying he had forgotten about the August meeting. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> also can expect questioning from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel about a secret plan approved by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to slip more than $ 110 million in extra aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in exchange for supporting the Contras. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last week that his 1985 trip to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was not part of any such `` quid pro quo'' scheme. Documents released at the North trial state that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed extra aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, but do not allege that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tied the aid to Contra support. The president said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had no quid pro quo arrangement with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> `` as far as I know.'' However, a 42-page government-approved admission introduced at the trial says that in mid-January 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> prepared a memo for <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> in advance of a meeting between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> president. `` One purpose of the meeting was to encourage continued Honduran support for the resistance -LRB- the Contras -RRB-,'' said the document. `` The memorandum alerted <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> that -LRB- <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> would insist on receiving clear economic and social benefits from its cooperation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, once the target of <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> protests that he undermined cleanup of federal facilities, pledged on Thursday to take strong steps against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government polluters if he is confirmed for <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 position. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the deputy administrator-designate, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that he would be an `` aggressive advocate'' to see that federal facilities `` meet or exceed'' anti-pollution measures in the private sector. As chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Land and <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> division, <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON> in 1986 and 1987 admittedly helped write the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy that forced <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government polluters, instead of handing them orders to clean up their pollution. Internal EPA memos at the time called the plan `` unlawful'' because it was more lenient toward government than private polluters, and warned the double standard could `` severely damage'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s credibility. In more recent interviews, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the policy has allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Energy departments to stall negotiations involving their facilities, thereby delaying agreements to clean up some of the nation's worst pollution sites. Asked at his confirmation hearing how he would enforce federal cleanup, <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON> said, `` We in the federal government have to do what is necessary to bring the federal agencies in compliance. If that involves ... the administrative enforcement process, I would support that kind of action.'' He said in disputes among federal agencies, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> must be able to `` call the shots.'' Under questioning from Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON> acknowledged he could not speak for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on federal facilities cleanup, testifying, `` This is my personal position I ca n't say whether that's the administration's position.'' But <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON> said federal agencies are more willing than before to clean up their facilities, and singled out <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> as one who is interested in a strong environmental program. He promised the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will `` formulate and communicate to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' a program to bring federal facilities into compliance with anti-pollution laws. <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON> went to work after 1987 for a private consulting firm headed by former <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruckelshaus </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is preparing to stage the largest international gathering ever in that isolated country: a youth festival with an anti-imperialist theme. About 30,000 people from more than 170 countries are expected for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students on July 1-8 in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, said So Man Sul, chairman of a preparatory committee for the pro-North <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Residents </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. About 20,000 people from 157 countries attended the last festival in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1985, So said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has not held a major international event since the 35th World Table Tennis Championships in 1979, which brought 900 players from 85 countries to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had demanded to be a co-host with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> of the 1988 Summer Olympics. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> offered to let it stage several of the Olympic events, but the offer fell short of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s demands, and it boycotted the Games. So said the youth festival would be the largest international gathering ever held in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital since <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was divided at the end of World War II. The festival's theme is `` Anti-imperialist Solidarity and Peace,'' and will include representatives from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The festival, first held in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> in 1947, is a major political, cultural and sports event involving mostly communist and Third World nations. Previous hosts have included <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. Asked about prospects for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s participation, So said: `` We are n't so optimistic.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has invited South Korean radical students to attend in letters sent through the South Korean government. Since April, however, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has refused to accept further <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> letters meant for radical student groups and dissidents. The policy change followed an unauthorized trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by a South Korean dissident, the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, for talks on national unification. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> was arrested on his return to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on April 13 on charges of violating a law requiring all <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> to obtain government permission to visit <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The communist nation suspended all dialogue with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to protest <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s arrest. So said sports events at the festival would include the marathon, soccer, basketball, volleyball, table tennis, gymnastics, swimming and diving. All facilities for the festival have been completed in and around the capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, he added, including hotels, stadiums and theaters. North Korean officials have been quoted by foreign media as saying about $ 4 billion was spent on the festival so far.

 The Cabinet minister in charge of largely unsuccessful efforts to draw black leaders into negotiations announced his resignation Thursday. Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> gave no reason for his decision, announced a week after he made a ground-breaking speech in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> proposing that blacks be given a role in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, in the Cabinet and in the selection of a president. On Wednesday, another senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, announced his resignation, saying he wanted to return to private life. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has overseen the enforcement of press censorship during the 3-year-old state of emergency. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, the leader of the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, will resign from the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> on July 1. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, the party leader in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>, will resign Sept. 6, when a general election is scheduled. There will be at least six vacancies on the 17-member Cabinet when it meets after the election, providing an opportunity for a major overhaul by F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, the favorite to succeed P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as president. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> unsuccessfully competed against <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> in February for the position of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. Two ministers of agriculture and economic affairs previously announced they would not seek re-election, and the minister of manpower quit after being linked to allegations of financial impropriety. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s portfolio as national education minister also probably will be vacant. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, 62, joined <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 and has been a close associate of P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> during the president's 11 years in power. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> often was mentioned as a possible successor to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, but political commentators said his chances were hurt by his lack of progress in persuading prominent blacks leader to enter negotiations about power-sharing. Some blacks were deterred by the government's insistence the white minority retain veto power over major decisions made in any new form of government. Other blacks say they will enter negotiations only if jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is freed and bans on militant black groups are lifted. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> announced this week that a group of black mayors and town councilors had agreed to begin negotiations on power-sharing. But the 1988 local election that put these officials in office was widely boycotted by blacks, and black leaders of national prominence have shown little interest in the so-called National Forum. Under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of apartheid, the 5 million whites control the government, while the 28 million blacks have no role in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and no voice in national affairs.

<HEAD>New Secrets Act Gets Royal Approval Amid Criticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s new Official Secrets Act got the royal seal of approval Thursday, even though it has been denounced by critics as a government assault on the public's right to know. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government called it an improvement on the original 1911 act, which contained 2,000 different ways of charging someone with revealing official information, however trivial, without authorization. Critics said the new law's major flaw is that it denies officials who leak information about improper or questionable government conduct the defense that they acted in the public interest or that the information has already been published elsewhere. The law received the Royal Assent, a final formality before taking effect later this year. The Home Office said no date has been announced. The 1911 law, hastily passed during a German spy scare, has given <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> the reputation of being one of the most secretive Western democracies. Technically it covered everything from the civil service's tea intake to the fertilizer applied to Buckingham Palace's flowerbeds. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said the new legislation `` removes from criminal sanction the unauthorized disclosure of large quantities of official information, substantial as well as trivial, including disclosures which might merely embarrass or inconvenience the government of the day.'' Introduced after months of controversy and debate, the new law codifies the government's right to secrecy in six specified areas covering defense, the security services, crime prevention and detection, and international relations. The only automatic offenses will be leaking or publicizing security service bugging, telephone tapping and mail interception. In other cases of unauthorized disclosures by journalists or the 800,000 civil servants, diplomats and defense industry workers who have taken an Official Secrets Act oath, prosecutors will have to prove a `` damaging disclosure'' has been made about a branch of government. The government says that by shifting the burden of proof to the prosecution, it has enhanced civil liberties. It also says the new law is an improvement because the receiver of unauthorized information is no longer liable to prosecution. But critics say that by specifically excluding the `` public interest'' defense, the government has set freedom back. Newspapers say the government will have little difficulty finding expert witnesses such as retired military officers to testify that publication was damaging. `` What of the man who breaks down the door of a stranger's house to save a child from fire?'' asked <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Birt </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>, writing in the newspaper, The Independent. `` There may well be damage, but what counts are the good consequences of his actions.'' The new law retains the lifetime gag on members of the MI5 and MI6 intelligence agencies, and continues to shield the intelligence services from any parliamentary scrutiny. `` The government has drawn the cloak of secrecy even more tightly around the operations of the security and intelligence services,'' says Article 19, an anti-censorship organization. Since coming to power in 1979, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government has mounted at least 24 prosecutions under the Official Secrets Act, compared with 34 in the previous 68 years. In 1985, a jury acquitted civil servant <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponting </PERSON>, saying he acted in the public interest in exposing a government cover-up surrounding the sinking of an Argentine cruiser in the Falkland Islands War. Under the new law, <PERSON> Ponting </PERSON> likely would have been convicted. Civil libertarians claim freedom of expression has shrunk during the Thatcher era. They cite the government's increasing use of court injunctions to suppress news; its futile three-year battle to ban `` Spycatcher,'' a retired intelligence agent's memoirs; a police raid on <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> studios to seize tapes; an attempt to suppress a TV documentary questioning the government's version of the killing of three <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> terrorist suspects; a ban on broadcast interviews with Irish militants. At a news conference Thursday, Lord <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> publishers, said he was `` very frightened that every day takes a step closer to tyranny ... the mechanisms of tyranny seem to be inbuilt in our society.'' Labor lawmaker <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchan </PERSON> said he was concerned `` that secrecy is now becoming a kind of a habit of governments and as soon as you have secrecy in government actions, tyranny is an almost inevitable consequence.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee to be ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government has `` not met what we would consider standards of legitimacy'' in the first phase of preparations for elections next year `` There were in fact no direct negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the internal opposition groups over the content of the reforms that were to be made,'' <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Einaudi </PERSON>, director of policy planning for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, testified at a hearing. `` Rather, these were in effect imposed by the Sandinistas,'' <PERSON> Einaudi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Einaudi </PERSON> was among final witnesses in three days of hearings by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on a Free and Fair Election in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, a bipartisan panel supported by private donations that will come up with suggested guidelines for the February balloting. The commission was established by the conservative <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The commission also heard from <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuette </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which, with its Democratic counterpart, sponsored the Panamanian election observation team headed by former Presidents <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. After observing the elections in that country, <PERSON> Schuette </PERSON> said, `` the lessons we have drawn have important applicability to developments in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' `` Our experience ... is that the quality and intention of an electoral law is but one element of the critical determinants of whether an election will be free and fair,'' he testified. `` The other two points of analysis are the caliber and organization of the opposition and the overall organization of government.'' `` There are disturbing parallels, too frequent to be considered accidental, between these three elements in the cases of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said. He said he had concluded that `` sufficient freedom of organization, expression and activity does not currently exist to ensure a free and fair election'' in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. That view was echoed by <PERSON> Einaudi </PERSON>, who said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` very concerned'' that the first stage of preparations for the election `` has in fact not met what we would consider standards of legitimacy.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> appeared to have shown `` a complete unwillingness to open the system further'' when they empowered President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to name all five members of an electoral commission made up of two Sandinista members, two opposition members and a neutral member. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s naming of a neutral member in reality will make the commission `` an automatic Sandinista rubber stamp,'' <PERSON> Einaudi </PERSON> said. He added, however, that he is `` cautiously optimistic'' that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> may make changes to make the electoral system more palatable. <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> <PERSON> Winsor </PERSON>, former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ambassador to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and co-chairman of the commission, said that although <PERSON> Einaudi </PERSON> is the ambassador-designate to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> he was testifying in his current <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> capacity. The Nicaraguan elections are to be held under an agreement <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> made with the governments of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.

 A group of homeless men, led by a monk who runs a soup kitchen, has formed a softball team named `` The Soupers'' and is taking on all comers with a price: Losing challengers must donate to the soup kitchen. `` A lot of people have asked where is our home field. As homeless people, I tell them it's appropriate we do n't have one,'' said Brother <PERSON> Denys </PERSON> <PERSON> Cormier </PERSON>, a monk of the <ORGANIZATION> Emmaus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> who runs the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen and is the team's manager Brother <PERSON> Denys </PERSON> hopes his team will help break stereotypes of the homeless as people either on drugs or alcohol, and help put faces on the working poor. He said there are about 6,000 homeless people in this city of 125,000. Teams that play The Soupers will have to make a donation, of any amount they choose, if they lose. But Brother <PERSON> Denys </PERSON> is hopeful even victorious opponents will pitch in and help the homeless. The challenge has gone out to established teams in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>'s softball leagues, and at least two teams have expressed interest But Brother <PERSON> Denys </PERSON> said his ballclub will play anybody. `` We'll go to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> if they'll pay for our tickets,'' he said Thursday. The Soupers plan to hold their first practice Sunday, after attending a weekly church service for the homeless run by their manager, who will wear his traditional gray robes during games. Twenty homeless men have signed up for the team, ranging in age from their early 20s to mid-30s. Most live at the city's three homeless shelters, and a number have temporary jobs. Several members of the fledgling team were top athletes while in high school. Some have had run-ins with the law and are trying to get their lives back together. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, 22, the team's captain, is one of them. After graduating from high school in <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION>, where he played basketball and baseball, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said he got into trouble because `` I did n't use my mind.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who declined to give his last name, has lived at a city shelter for four months, and has lived at other times with an aunt. He said playing softball should lift the spirits of the homeless men and show the community they are no different from anyone else. `` Some of these guys are really feeling bad because of the situation they are in. They have not chosen to be in this position. I think if you give them a little motivation, they will have a better attitude toward things,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want people to be afraid of the homeless,'' added <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a muscular and articulate man who is now earning about $ 40 a day as a temporary laborer. `` If they see us out there playing ball, maybe they will think they are n't that bad.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said he expects his team to be very competitive. A restaurant has already agreed to donate shirts to the team, and other contributions of equipment or money are being sought. Some soup-kitchen volunteers will be inserted in the lineup at times, a reflection of Brother <PERSON> Denys </PERSON>' belief that the homeless should not be singled out as somehow different. While committed to fighting stereotypes of the homeless, <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Denys </PERSON> still chuckles at the thought of all the jokes that may spring from his fielding a team of homeless men. `` When someone yells ` Bums' at the umpires,'' he said, `` our whole team will stand up.''

<TEXT>
 A Marine sergeant was demoted to corporal and fined $ 600 for not disclosing during a dental visit that he had tested positive for the AIDS virus. Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roantes </PERSON>, 29, pleaded guilty on Tuesday. He could have received up to 10 years in prison, a dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of all pay at sentencing Wednesday. <PERSON> Roantes </PERSON> was accused of exposing a dental hygienist to the AIDS virus last year. Several witnesses said they feared for their lives when blood-tainted saliva sprayed around the room as the hygienist cleaned his teeth at a base facility. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Roantes </PERSON>' failure to tell the hygienist put her in danger of contracting the virus because she did not take the additional precautions called for when treating a patient who may have AIDS. But Dr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenburg </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, testified for the defense that he had treated about 2,000 AIDS or AIDS virus-related patients. `` Based on what she said, and the precautions she took, she was in absolutely no danger,'' <PERSON> Rosenburg </PERSON> said.

 Foul-smelling gases from two rancid grain piles near a grain elevator caused the death of a 24-year-old pregnant woman who lived nearby, according to a lawsuit filed by her family. <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Oland </PERSON>, who was seven months pregnant, died in September 1987 from an accumulation of fluid in her lungs, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Oland </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Lidgerwood </LOCATION> less than 200 yards from two huge grain piles maintained by <ORGANIZATION> Harvest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, the lawsuit said.

The grain piles were drenched by rain before they were covered and began to spoil, according to the lawsuit. Residents of <LOCATION> Lidgerwood </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s southeastern corner 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, began to complain of the odor in the summer of 1987.

 Film buffs and movie stars paid homage to <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> on Thursday as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> got under way for the 42nd year at this sparkling <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> resort. On Wednesday night, at a special pre-opening, T.E. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> rode across the desert to the delight of the movie audience in the European premiere of the restored version of `` Lawrence of Arabia.'' French Culture Minister <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> opened the 13-day festival, paying homage to Chaplain. Present for the opening were <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s granddaughter, <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON>, as well as <PERSON> Rosanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Arquette </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Montand </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Monaco </LOCATION> On Wednesday night, <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> swept grandly into the Palais des Festivals for the black-tie showing of the uncut, original 216-minute version of Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lean </PERSON>'s `` Lawrence of Arabia.'' They ascended a staircase lined with young men in Bedouin dress. At a news conference Thursday, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> spoke of his love for the film. `` Last night sitting next to <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, we both said to each other if we made no other picture and had to rest on this picture, I would be extremely happy,'' he said. On Thursday, there was a showing of `` New York Stories,'' the film with segments directed by <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>. `` Lawrence of Arabia'' and `` New York Stories'' are outside the official competition, but 22 other films from 14 countries are competing for the prestigious festival award, the <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION>, to be presented at the close of the festival May 23. The winner will be decided by a 10-member jury, headed by West German director <PERSON> Wim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenders </PERSON>. `` I do n't think there is a recipe for a good film,'' <PERSON> Wenders </PERSON> said. `` For me, a good film is a film that has found a moment of truth.'' `` We are simply looking for films that achieve a vision ... and certainly an idea and a feeling,'' said actress <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON>, another member of the jury. This year's official selection emphasizes film as entertainment, departing from last year's festival which featured a great many long, somber `` cinema d'auteur'' films. Some say this year's festival has its eye on the stars. Film stars are everywhere on <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION>' main street, La Croisette. Among those showing up Thursday was <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON>, who plays a famous artist about to be deserted by his lover-assistant in the Scorsese portion of `` New York Stories.'' Much awaited is <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>, whose face stares from magazine covers and newspaper kiosks all over <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. She stars in <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schepisi </PERSON>'s `` A Cry in the Dark,'' about an Australian woman accused of infanticide after her baby is snatched by a dingo in the outback. Four American films are competing for the Golden Palm: <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s `` Do the Right Thing,'' <PERSON> High </PERSON> <PERSON> Hundson </PERSON>'s `` Lost Angels,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarmusch </PERSON>'s `` Mystery Train'' and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderbergh </PERSON>'s `` Sex, Lies and Video Tapes,'' the director's first full-length film. Three French movies are in the competition, including the much awaited `` Trop Belle Pour Toi'' -LRB- `` Too Beautiful for You'' -RRB-, directed by <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Blier </PERSON> and starring <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s favorite leading man, <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Depardieu </PERSON>. He plays a garage mechanic who falls out of love with his beautiful wife in favor of a less - attractive woman Among other films receiving special attention is `` Splendor'' by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ettore </PERSON> <PERSON> Scola </PERSON>, a veteran of <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION>. While the tone of the festival has been set in the opening days with films by established directors, four directors competing for the coveted prize are showing their first full-length films here. Beside the official competitors, more than 1,500 movies will be screened. <PERSON> Wenders </PERSON> said he hoped the festival and the jury vote would `` advance the art of cinema.'' `` Everybody knows how much harm has been done by the fact that everthing is on television, so much, so fast,'' he said. `` Young people, especially ... have lost the feeling of going to the movies.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today decided to order up to 3,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and evacuate some American dependents from that volatile country, informed sources said. He urged allied nations to condemn Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for election fraud. Adminstration sources said the Pentagon was preparing to sending the troops from two bases, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. The sources said one group of about 1,000 would be dispatched immediately from the 7th Light Infantry Division from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>. The other, he said, would be drawn from the 5th Infantry Divsion at Fork Polk and would not arrive in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` for days'' because that is a mechanized infantry division and the men and their equipment will be transported by ship. The actions would beef up the 10,000-strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop strength in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with additional forces as one of a series of actions in response to the nullification of the Panamanian election results by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the post-election violent attacks against opposition politicians, said the sources who had knowledge of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision. In addition, some of the dependents of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were to be returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while others were being relocated for safety reasons from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and other locations to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, a source said. Further, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was continuing talks with leaders of Latin countries to support various intiatives they were undertaking in the aftermath of what many condemned as an election blatantly rigged by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, officials said. For example, the president backed the call by <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> for an urgent meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, the sources said. `` The president is going to take a whole series of actions,'' said one administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official characterized the moves as `` prudent measures to asure the safety of Americans and assuare the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can fulfill its commitment to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties.'' Earlier today, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces to prepare for possible deployment, as he weighed a series of options against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where rioters attacked opposition leaders. `` Our miltary forces that are involved are being readied for any possible changes in their status,'' White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in describing the administration stance a day after Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> nullified elections that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials condemned as fraudulent. `` We have an obligation to the safety and security of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and we have substantial military commitments in that country. We intend to meet our obligations.'' `` There are also steps to be taken on the diplomatic front,'' he sid. The spokesman would not elaborate on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scheduled an announcement later in the day to announce his plans. `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s electoral tribunal last night perpetrated the ultimate electoral theft in nullifying the elections,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> today were `` conferring with leaders of Latin American countries'' on the actions he plans to take. `` We know they share our concern and that shared interest moves us to define the course of actions that will protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and register our intention to stand up for democracy in the wake of Sunday's fraudulent election,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The spokesman said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objectives in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were to protect the 51,000 American citizens living there, to maintain the terms of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, maintain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest in its defense establishments in that country and promote democracy and the rights of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also decried the Soviet position stated in the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was justified in nullifying the election. The spokesman said that `` tends to throw cold water'' on the Soviet talk of a new openness. Congressional leaders who attended a strategy session with the president predicted there would be near unanimous support on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decisions. `` The president is proposing constructive steps in concert with other countries,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` The president and his people are still consulting with leaders of other countries that are concerned. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., described <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s measures as `` preliminary,'' adding: `` Who knows what may happen tomorrow, or the next day, or next That will depend on the conduct of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' House Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said the American response `` has got to be something more than just something symbolic You either mean business or you do n't.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters after the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> session, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` expressed the absolute determination to protect American lives. In that we certainly do support him.'' Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, concerned for the safety of the Americans, asked the 152 dependents of diplomats to move to military bases, and embassy spokeswoman <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that the move was underway. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said it would be `` leaping to a conclusion'' to assume the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions would involve military response, although <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said earlier that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` leaning toward'' beefing up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. ABC News reported that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to send 3,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and was working toward a joint measure with Latin allies. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials who asked not to be identified told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is leaning toward'' deployment of 2,000 to 2,500 combat troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to reinforce the American military presence there. But the sources stressed today that no final decision had been made and that no `` execute order'' had been received. `` It looks like its going to go that way; sending down some more troops,'' the source said. `` But there is nothing definite and we're not saddling up the ntire 82nd Airborne.'' Administration sources said the 5th Infantry Division units will probably be dispatched with armored personnel carriers and only a small number of tanks. One official said a mechanized force would be sent as a precaution in case the situation deterioriates and additional protection is needed to help dependents evacuate. The sources also disclosed that a `` very small'' unit from the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, might be dispatched via ship transport, but declined to elaborate. And the officials further noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had the option of ordering an aircraft carrier battle group to the region. By sheer coincidence, the carrier <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and six escorts departed <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and two other ports Thursday, bound for a routine deployment in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` The group was told to stay loose, they might have to hang a right turn,'' said one official. The <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> battle group's deployment was planned months ago and its departure announced publicly last Monday. One military official called the plan `` a show of force that is being orchestrated at the White House. We're not sure about the goals from a military standpoint besides our continuing concern about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dependents.'' Rioting broke out in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> following Sunday's presidential elections, branded as fraudulent by observers and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The opposition claimed victory and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> tossed out the election results late Wednesday, hours after armed civilians mobbed and beat several demonstrators in the streets, including presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>.. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are on heightened alert There are 10,000 troops based at installations along the 50-mile long <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, tribunal head <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulice </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> blamed the nullification on `` the obstructionist action by many foreigners,'' alluding to the team of observers <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent to monitor the elections.

 Entertainer <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> has been charged with smuggling for illegally bringing her dog <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> into <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, a court clerk said Thursday. The cairn terrier had been threatened with arrest and imprisonment in a kennel last month, but was freed on bail and deported to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> after negotiations with Ms. <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON>. Criminal charges were filed Wednesday in the district court of <LOCATION> Helsingborg </LOCATION>, the port where Ms. <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> brought in <LOCATION> Lilly </LOCATION> on a bus during her world tour with <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> faces a stiff fine because it normally is pegged to income, court clerk <PERSON> Ingalill </PERSON> <PERSON> Falkman </PERSON> said She refused to speculate on how high it could go. `` We regard smuggling of animals very seriously because of the risk of spreading rabies,'' Ms. <PERSON> Falkman </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s bloodied opposition leaders today rejected nullification of presidential elections and clung to the claim they won the vote. Dependents of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats began moving onto military bases to ensure their safety, an embassy spokeswoman said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided to order additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and evacuate some American dependents from the country, informed sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. Panamanian soldiers patrolled the capital, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel were advised to stay off the streets if possible and to wear only civilian clothes in public. International condemnation of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> intensified following attacks on opposition candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two running mates by bat - and pipe-wielding thugs Wednesday `` We won and we will continue to fight,'' said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, the second vice presidential candidate who suffered a beating. He said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> `` is still president.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said he was taken to <LOCATION> Modelo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> where a judge sentenced him to a year in jail for inciting riot and attacking soldiers. But he was freed a few hours later. He had stitches over his left eye and cheek. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said the opposition wants to talk with the military but that would require getting rid of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` because <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> can not have two presidents.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is head of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the country's de facto ruler. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> suffered a scalp wound Wednesday requiring eight stitches. His doctors issued a statement today saying his condition was stable and there were no neurological complications. Soldiers did not interfere during the beatings, which broke out after troops halted an opposition demonstration to protest what international observers have called the government's theft of Sunday's vote. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and other officials said one of <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s bodyguards was killed and about 20 demonstrators injured. The military said four soldiers were wounded. Opponents had hoped to rally international opinion against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and prevent the proclamation of his hand-picked candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, as president. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> asked the 152 dependents of diplomats to move to military bases, and embassy spokeswoman <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said the move was under way. `` You have these dignity battallions moving around town and targeting people. We're not sure who they're next targets are going to be. So rather than leave people exposed to possible attacks by these roving mobs, they're moving people onto the bases just as a precaution,'' she said. At the Pentagon, officials said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had not issued similar orders affecting dependents of servicemen. There are about 14,000 military dependents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, of whom about 3,100 live away from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to announce he was sending additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to back up the 10,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers already in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` has done everything he could to steal that election. And when it became extraordinarily difficult to accomplish,'' he declared it null. `` Either way you look at it, it is a perversion and a subversion of the will, the freely expressed will, of the Panamanian people,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> today condemned the annulling of the elections, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> demanded that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> resign. Venezuelan President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> for an emergency meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> to consider actions against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. In announcing the nullification, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s official electoral commission cited vote-stealing, vote-buying, missing tally sheets and international interference in voiding the election. The commission said nothing about rescheduling the vote. More than 300 international observers, including former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, backed opposition claims that <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> won by a 3-to-1 margin. Official results, however, had shown Duque leading by about 2-to-1. <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulice </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>, charged in a nationwide broadcast that the outcome of the vote was `` altered by the obstructionist action by the many foreigners.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent an uninvited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to monitor the elections, and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> reportedly contributed $ 10 million to the opposition campaign. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> began its campaign to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after he orchestrated President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after the general was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges in February 1988. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies the drug charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claims the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to get rid of him so it can renege on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, which cede the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
 Attorneys for a judge and the state <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> agreed Thursday to make public the contents of formal proceedings against the judge stemming from remarks he made against homosexuals. The allegations cite comments state District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> made in December to the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> as well as remarks a court official in <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION>'s office allegedly made to callers protesting his statements. The commission charges allege that <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s remarks violated the Code of Judicial Conduct, which prohibits a judge from publicly commenting on a pending case. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> also is charged with violating the code that requires a judge to conduct himself in a manner that promotes public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary. The agreement came during a brief hearing before special master <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, a retired judge from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> appointed to handle the case. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> was not present. In an interview published in the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> in December, <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> said he gave a lighter sentence to convicted killer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bednarski </PERSON>, 18, in part because his two victims were `` queers.'' <PERSON> Bednarski </PERSON> was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He could have received a maximum life sentence. `` I do n't care much for queers cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> told the newspaper. `` I've got a teen-age boy.'' On the same day <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s comments were published in the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, he told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, `` The victims were homosexuals. They were out in the homosexual area picking up teen-age boys. Had they not been out there trying to spread AIDS around, they'd still be alive today.'' The charges against <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> also state that when people who had read the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> report and heard an <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> radio network broadcast called <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s office to complain, they were referred to an attorney's office and told to `` have a gay Christmas.'' The commission alleges the court officials' response was `` cavalier, disdainful and undignified.'' The commission announced in February its decision to initiate formal proceedings against <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> will report to the 11-member commission, then the panel could dismiss the complaint, issue a public censure or recommend the judge's removal.

<HEAD>Feds Urge Steps to Curb Rising TB Rate Behind Bars</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The tuberculosis rate in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prisons may be more than three times higher than on the outside, federal health officials said Thursday, urging testing, isolation and other measures to curb TB behind bars. Researchers with the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> cited a survey in 29 states, where prisons reported 31 tuberculosis cases per 100,000 inmates in 1984-85, compared with eight cases per 100,000 reported among non-incarcerated adults in those states during the same period. `` In some large correctional systems, the incidence of TB has increased dramatically,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, noting that in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state there were 106 TB cases per 100,000 inmates in 1986 _ seven times more than the average of 15 cases reported in 1976-78. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, inmates had a TB rate of 110 per 100,000 in 1987, 11 times higher than the general <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> population. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the rate was nearly six times higher _ 80 per 100,000. Tuberculosis, a contagious, bacterial lung disease, occurs in about 22,000 new cases each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; most can be cured with drug treatment. As many as 7 percent of Americans have latent TB infections, and about 10 percent of them will someday develop a case of tuberculosis itself. `` Persons at highest risk ... are close contacts,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, noting that TB can pose particular problems in prisons, where there is often overcrowding and `` where the environment is often conducive to airborne transmission of infection among inmates, staff and visitors.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the Elimination of Tuberculosis is recommending TB testing for most new prison inmates and staff members _ with the possible exception of inmates just transferring through for less than a week. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> committee also recommends new tests at least once a year, rapid chest X-rays for TB-infected people showing symptoms, and isolation _ off the prison property, if necessary _ for those with suspected or confirmed symptomatic TB cases. The spread of AIDS-virus infections may play a part in the spread of TB in prisons, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. AIDS weakens the immune system, making patients susceptible to infections other people might ward off, including tuberculosis. AIDS tests should be offered to all inmates with known TB infections, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> report said.

<HEAD>Elderly React Better Than Young People to Spouse Death, Study Suggests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Elderly people suffer less depression and anxiety by the time seven months pass after a spouse's death than do younger people, a study suggests. Their reactions may be eased by a feeling that death is expected in old people, and the experience of having lost friends and relatives before, suggested researcher <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Zisook </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. They may also escape a stigma that can affect younger widows and widowers, who suddenly find themselves single in a peer group of couples and perhaps perceived as a sexual rival by others of the same gender, he said. <PERSON> Zisook </PERSON> presented the study of more than 300 widows and widowers Wednesday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He said the sample overrepresented white and middle-class people. Ages ranged from 26 to 85 years with an average of 61 years. Seventy-one percent were female. The subjects had been married an average of 32 years, and 64 percent had lost the spouse to an illness lasting more than three months. Eighty-eight percent of the survivors reported grieving two months after the death, and those people tended to show more depression and anxiety than non-grievers one year after the loss, <PERSON> Zisook </PERSON> said. That finding does not support the idea that active grieving in the short run helps longer-term adjustment, he said. To study age-related differences, <PERSON> Zisook </PERSON> and co-authors split the group into 94 people of ages 26 to 55, 175 people of ages 56 to 69, and 77 people of ages 70 and older. The oldest group showed the least amount of depression seven months after the loss, as measured by three independent standards. By one yardstick, 11 percent of the oldest group had moderate to severe depression at seven months, in contrast to 29 percent of the youngest group and 23 percent of the middle group. The oldest group also showed less anxiety than the younger groups at two months and seven months after the loss.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will have 110 fewer F-14 fighter planes than it says it needs by 1996, according to a study released Thursday by a congressman seeking to save the Grumman-built jet. `` No matter how you slice the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Cheney </ORGANIZATION> budget, it comes up dangerously short in <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aircraft,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who requested the study by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The report, described in its introduction as `` a quick, rough analysis,'' concludes that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will have 417 F-14 Tomcats at the end of fiscal 1996, 110 fewer than it has said it will need. The study assumes there will be an increased demand for F-14s as two aircraft carriers are converted from airwings which carry no F-14s to airwings which carry 20 each, and projects a loss of 70 F-14s during the period due to peacetime accidents. Battle lines were drawn last month when <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> submitted his fiscal 1990 budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which saved $ 360 million by cutting orders for 12 new F-14Ds.

 Arms dealer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, in an indictment unsealed today, was charged with lying during the 1987 congressional Iran-Contra hearings by denying he profited from the U.S.-Iran arms sales. The nine-count indictment accused <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> of giving false testimony to the special <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees that investigated the U.S.-Iran arms deals and the diversion of profits from them to the Nicaraguan rebels. The indictment charged that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> lied when he told the joint hearings that he `` foreswore'' any profits from the dummy corporations he operated with his former business partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. `` I foreswore them and left to Mr. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> to do with it as he wished,'' <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> said in a statement Iran-Contra prosecutors charged was false. The indictment charged that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> lied when he said he gave a Swiss-based attorney only $ 400,000 of his money to manage. In fact, it said when, in fact, he used the lawyer `` on a continuous basis to manage over a million dollars of profits allocated'' to <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. A retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is already charged, along with <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, with participating in the Iran-Contra conspiracy. He was the lead witness in the televised hearings conducted in the spring and summer of 1987 by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> testified without limited immunity from prosecution before the congressional panels. The latest indictment was returned by a federal grand jury on April 7 but was kept under seal until the end of the trial of former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. North was convicted last week of three felony counts but acquitted of nine others stemming from his role in the Iran-Contra affair. In a statement, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s lawyers called the indictment `` a clear example of complete abdication of prosecutorial discretion.'' The second indictment makes it `` painfully obvious that the prosecutor's office is fearful that what little is left of its original case against General <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> can no longer withstand attack in the courtroom.'' The new charges show that the independent counsel `` intends to go to extraordinary lengths to find some charge, however immaterial, for which General <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> can be prosecuted,'' said defense lawyers <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> and <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lankford </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. As the indictment was unsealed today, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was convicted in a suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> court of driving while intoxicated <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> a suspended 30-day jail sentence and ordered him to pay a $ 500 fine, of which $ 300 was suspended, said deputy prosecutor <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s driver's license was suspended for six months, but he was allowed to drive between his home, work and an alcoholism rehabilitation center, <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> said. The federal indictment charged that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> `` endeavored to impede the select committees from learning the true facts about the finances of the enterprise and his relationship to those finances by providing false, evasive and misleading evidence'' while under oath. The indictment, ordered unsealed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, charged that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> `` willfully and knowingly'' obstructed the investigation by the congressional committees into his role as a middleman in the U.S.-Iran arms deals. It said, among other things, that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> lied when he testified at the hearings that he had no interest in a company called <ORGANIZATION> Korel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> even though he was a principal shareholder. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, 56, is also accused of lying by stating that he did not share in the profits of the Iran-Contra `` enterprise,'' even though he earned profits from the operation. Each charge upon conviction carries a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment and $ 250,000 in fines. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is lso charged with lying the committees' staff by denying that any of the proceeds went to North. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told reporters that the charge relates to alleged lies about `` the $ 200,000 fund'' for North's family in the event he failed to return from a trip to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and about <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s acceptance of a $ 13,800 home security system. The count accused <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> of denying to lawyers for the congressional Iran-Contra panels that he was aware of any money from the enterprise that went to benefit North. North was convicted last week of accepting an illegal gratuity when he allowed <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to install the security system outside his home in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> are already charged with conspiring to pay an illegal gratuity to North

 A 15-year-old girl who says she was stood up on prom night now wants to get even: She's suing her date for $ 49.53 for her shoes, flowers and hairdo he never got to see. <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> junior <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadd </PERSON> says he called off the date a week before the dance. And besides, he says, he had a good excuse. `` She did n't believe me when I told her I fractured my ankle,'' <PERSON> Shadd </PERSON> said. `` This is so stupid. I'm so sick of all this. I've never heard anything so disgraceful in my whole life,'' his mother, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, said Thursday. `` I offered her the money. You know what she tells me? She tells me the boy has to be punished.'' The teen-agers appeared Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Tomontra </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangrum </PERSON>'s mother filed a claim for the cost of the shoes, flowers and hairdo. A $ 280 dress with black and white ruffles was returned unworn. There is some dispute over the facts of the case. Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said her 17-year-old son, a high school basketball player, told <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangrum </PERSON> a week before his school's April 7 formal that he would be unable to attend because he was on crutches with a fractured ankle. On prom night, he was out of town seeing a college recruiter. But Miss <PERSON> Mangrum </PERSON> says she was stood up without notice. `` I talked to him on April 2 and he said he already had his tux and the tickets,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangrum </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Berean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> student. `` I was very upset when he did n't show up.'' <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangrum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> tried to track down her daughter's date on prom night. `` I called and called and called until I got his mother,'' she said. `` She was very upset about this.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> ca n't understand why the broken date has wound up in court. `` The problem is everybody looks to her like she's a poor little innocent girl,'' she said. `` He's a kid, too. He should n't be put to this shame.'' The Mangrums are demanding $ 26 for shoes that could n't be returned, $ 23 for a hairdo and 53 cents for flowers in the teen-ager's hair. Filing the claim cost $ 31.75, but if they win the July trial, <PERSON> Shadd </PERSON> may have to pay that, too. `` I do n't have any money. I'm poor. Why is she doing this?'' his mother asked. County Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> is taking the case seriously. `` The issue is, was there a valid contract? We had an offer and we had an acceptance,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. `` Could she have gotten another date to the prom?''

 A senior military official accused neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on Thursday of planning to invade <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, capture two major cities and turn them over to Moslem guerrillas. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> <PERSON> Olumy </PERSON> told a news conference the plan was to attack the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> in the south on Sunday. The general is secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and a ranking member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who uses only one name, has repeatedly accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of armed intervention, which the Pakistanis deny. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> serves as a base for the guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978, and the insurgents get most of their support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Olumy </PERSON> said 7,000 Pakistani soldiers and militiamen disguised as guerrillas had been moved to the border or inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for the new assault on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and a smaller force was being mobilized near <LOCATION> Quetter </LOCATION> to attack <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> provincial capital 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, has been under siege since March 7. The insurgents made it their first major target after the Soviet military withdrawal was completed Feb. 15, and they initially predicted it would fall within days. Military officials say the city has been hit by more than 131,000 shells and rockets, more than 500 civilians have been killed and at least 3,000 wounded. Earlier this week, the army launched a counterattack and claimed the guerrillas had been pushed back as much as 25 miles on two fronts. <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> province, has been under sporadic attack for a year.

<HEAD>Researchers Stymied on Pig Deaths, Could It Be Drought Related?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Researchers have been struggling for more than a year trying to find what malady is killing baby pigs, and one veterinarian says he believes the deaths may be drought-related. Pathologist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> veterinary diagnostic laboratory said the failure of laboratory tissue studies to indicate a culprit is a strong point in favor of his theory the deaths are related to bad feed. It is possible the deaths come from poor quality grain containing toxins being fed to the pigs' mothers, he said. `` The dollar cost goes into the millions. It's a tremendous cost,'' said <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. He said the number of deaths has increased with the drought and with the related decline in quality and rise in contamination of grain. The outbreak in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> has been in isolated pockets, not widespread, and no figures for the number of pig deaths was available. Others believe a virus or a new strain of disease is to blame. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> said that while researchers have been unable to pinpoint the cause of the deaths for more than a year, `` This is not something to panic about.'' <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has been studying a mysterious outbreak of baby pigs in <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, where hundreds of pigs are reported to have died on a dozen farms. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Wollen </PERSON>, a veterinarian-pathologist at <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said a new strain of disease may be involved. `` You find a group of hog farmers locally having a problem, but it is not spreading across the state,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> extension veterinarian <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKean </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKean </PERSON> said scientists, including those at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, think the deaths are caused by a virus.

 Fifty years ago, long before satellites, space shuttles and planetary probes, work began on a national research center that would help make all those things possible. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> is celebrating its first half-century, beginning with an aerial photograph Friday of 2,000 employees arranged into a giant `` 50.'' Over the years, thousands of top scientists and engineers have worked at <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION>, developing swept-wing planes and supersonic flight, contributing to the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs and tracking Pioneer's voyages through the solar system. They have searched for the chemical building blocks of life, experimented with plants, insects and eggs in space, studied the effects of weightlessness and looked for holes in the atmosphere's ozone layer `` The two prominent features of Ames have been outstanding people and the development of major, unique, national aerospace facilities,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballhaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of the $ 500 million-a-year center. Space exploration was hardly a hot topic in 1939, when the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION>, predecessor of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, founded <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, named for <ORGANIZATION> NACA </ORGANIZATION> chairmen <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>. When tensions mounted before World War II, the government's <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> lab in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> was seen as vulnerable to attack by <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and a second facility was proposed 3,000 miles away at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Moffett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> base, 45 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> The threat from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was considered, but the site also had low-density air traffic, good flying weather, adequate electricity and access to the growing western aircraft industry, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. Today, <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> is in the heart of high-tech <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, and has grown into a maze of dozens of laboratories, wind tunnels and offices. `` When I first started working here -LRB- in 1971 -RRB-, during lunchtime I'd wander around in the various wind tunnels and laboratories and ask people what they were doing,'' <PERSON> Ballhaus </PERSON> said. `` It's fascinating, like a technical Disneyland. The Flight Research Building was put into operation in August 1940. By the fall, three wind tunnels were under construction to work on problems of theoretical aerodynamics. When the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> entered World War II, the basic research <ORGANIZATION> NACA </ORGANIZATION> emphasized was phased out while labs concentrated on immediate problems. Research on deicing airplane wings had started at <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION> as early as 1927. But the problem was licked at <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION> in 1944, proving the effectiveness of the new laboratory. In 1952, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a specialist in high-speed theoretical aerodynamics, was working on missile research when he developed the `` blunt-body theory,'' which would later solve the problem of heating during a spacecraft's reentry into the atmosphere. That theory would shape Project Mercury's reentry capsule and play a key role in the design of the Gemini and Apollo crafts and their heat shields. Ames work on high-speed flight helped lead to Capt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>'s first supersonic flight in the Bell X-1 on October 14, 1947. Eight years later <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION> researcher <PERSON> R.T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> came up with the `` supersonic area rule,'' which minimized drag on supersonic craft and allowed still faster planes. In 1958, <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> invented the lifting body, wingless craft able to fly back into the atmosphere from space, survive entry heating and land. That idea eventually led to the space shuttle. <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> was given responsibility for basic research in life sciences in 1961 and began studying the chemical evolution of life. In the 1970s, <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> broke new scientific ground with its Pioneer series of space probe. Pioneer 10, launched in 1972, became the first craft to go through the asteroid belt and returned the first close-up pictures of Jupiter. Four years later, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence began at <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION>, a program that listens for radio signals from other civilizations. `` Ames has had a big impact on the space program and on other sciences and it still is very important,'' said <PERSON> Ballhaus </PERSON>. `` The work here is helping us understand the universe and our environment.''

<HEAD>Voters Asked to Reset Property Tax Bases to Ensure School Survival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES E. BEGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> and legislative leaders are asking voters statewide to approve a property tax formula that opponents say would take control of school financing out of local hands. Supporters say the measure will aid about 100 public school districts with inadequate property tax bases, some dating to the early 1900s. A property tax base is an amount a school district can levy each year without seeking voter approval. Measure 1, on the ballot Tuesday, would reset all districts' tax bases to include whatever extra levies local voters have approved to make ends meet in 1988-89. Under the state constitution, the tax base can automatically increase by up to 6 percent a year. So broadening the base will make for bigger automatic increases each year. Supporters say this change is the next step in getting <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> out of a crisis that had schools closing for lack of money a few years ago. The first step, a `` safety net'' law passed in 1987, allowed schools in danger of shutting down to fall back on the previous year's tax levies without additional voter approval. However, school officials trying to make budgets on 2-year-old tax levies say they do n't have enough money to cope with inflation, enrollment increases and other needs. <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON>, a Democrat, and legislators from both parties argue that Measure 1 will bring some stability to school financing until a new source of funds can be developed. `` This is just a step, as was the safety net, toward equity,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitzhaber </PERSON>. `` There are no losers in this, only degrees of winners.'' Only about a third of the state's 303 school districts are potentially affected by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s ballot proposal. They are mostly rural and relatively small, meaning voters from the large, urban districts are likely to determine the fate of their tax bases. `` It tests whether people view schools as a statewide or local responsibility,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danielson </PERSON>, lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest teachers union. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Brummell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, a long-time tax critic and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeowners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the issue is whether taxpayers want `` remote voters'' to determine their taxes. `` The main thing we object to in the property tax is it's simply no longer fair,'' he said. `` Until the system is changed, there's no need to go through with this mediocre approach. Passage of Measure 1 automatically would enact a companion bill with $ 112 million in special school aid and property tax relief. It includes $ 35 million for educating handicapped students, $ 35 million for districts with high property tax rates and $ 22 million to ensure no districts get less basic aid under the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s actions this year than they now receive The bill also provides $ 20 million with the aim of limiting homeowner property tax bills for schools to no more than 5 percent of income.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s inability to attract advertisers for a made-for-TV movie on abortion demonstrates that big business listens when consumers take a stand, a crusader said Thursday. `` I alerted advertisers about the pro-choice stance of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s ` Roe vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>' movie and asked them not to sponsor it,'' said the Rev <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> minister heads the Tupelo-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an organization that has successfully challenged what it sees as profane and morally objectionable material in magazines, television and movies. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>'s comments follow a statement by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> urging advertisers not to bow to pressure groups seeking to block the film that is based on the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case that legalized abortion. In a May 8 letter to advertisers, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he would broadcast the movie as scheduled Monday without advertising, if advertisers pull out. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>, whose association was credited with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision May 2 to drop `` Crimes of Passion II'' from its prime-time schedule, said the latest action by corporate sponsors marked a trend to rid television of excessive sex and violence. He said the association, which has chapters scattered around the country, was voicing similar opposition to other television programs, and `` one coming up on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Friday night, ` <LOCATION> Amityville </LOCATION>: The Evil Escapes,' is in trouble.'' The fact-based `` Roe vs. Wade'' stars <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> as a character based on <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON>, the then-anonymous `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>'' plaintiff who sued <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wade </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> plays attorney <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Weddington </PERSON>. The abortion battle heightened when the high court heard arguments April 26 in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case that could affect the 1973 decision. The movie is about the pro-choice advocates who prevailed, but it also portrays sympathetically the prosecutors who argued the other side, though they get much less attention. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s letter to advertisers asked `` them not to be bullied. I am in agreement with that _ I do n't think these advertisers ought to let <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> or any other network bully them into any program.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has every right to air that movie and the advertisers have every right to help sponsor it. And more and more consumers are learning they have every right to spend their money where they want to and that, I think, has Mr. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> very upset,'' he said.

The spokesman said it raised new questions about Soviet intentions on improving relations with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, called the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> account `` very disappointing.'' `` It certainly tends to throw cold water on many of the claims of a new thinking, a new openness in foreign relations,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> reporting on Sunday's nullification of elections in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said the action was necessary because the opposition, `` directly instigated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' violated election laws and tried to rig the results through `` subversive actions. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` these statements reflect a lack of changes that we all would do well to keep in mind.'' `` While we welcome and encourage glasnost and perestroika'' the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration intended `` to keep in the back of our minds a very healthy skepticism about these kinds of things.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the Soviets have yet to match words with deeds. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s election tribunal invalidated the election results, saying the stealing of ballots, vote-buying and missing tally sheets made proclamation of a new president impossible. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report asserted that supporters of opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> had violated election procedures. `` They blockaded polling stations, preventing ballot boxes from being taken to the commission's headquarters in good time,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` A considerable number of ballot papers were stolen or destroyed and several ballot boxes were burned.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the decision to nullify the election `` appears to be extraordinary, but the only correct one.'' The Tass story, and <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s comments, came as Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting with his Soviet counterpart to discuss arms talks, and on the eve of a commencement speech by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M expected to focus on the results of his administration's review of East-West relations.

 The Communist Party chief of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> on Thursday backed a proposed language reform in the republic and lambasted local party leaders for lagging behind the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s fast pace of change, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Semyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON> `` spoke about the need to grant the status of official language to the Moldavian language,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, but cautioned that the reform should not infringe on the rights of other nationalities in the republic. Speaking at a plenary meeting of the Moldavian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON> said change in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> is not coming fast enough and `` the causes for this lag are shortcomings in the work of the party organization,'' the official news agency said. He also criticized leaders of some grass-roots political organizations for stirring up emotions, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Thousands of Moldavians demonstrated this spring in the republic's capital of <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, demanding changes in official policy on language, the economy and the environment as well as a crackdown on widespread crime and corruption. In March, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> criticized the <LOCATION> Moldavian </LOCATION> party leadership for adjusting too slowly to the republic's changing political life and letting the protests get out of hand. <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON> in February condemned nationalist activitists for going too far but endorsed some of their demands to make their native language closer to Romanian. Moldavian and Romanian are the same spoken language, but dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> imposed the Cyrillic alphabet after Soviet troops occupied the region during World War II. <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON> said work is under way to gradually reinstate the Latin script still used in neighboring <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. A draft law on the reintroduction of the Latin script will soon be put out for public discussion, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A man accused of killing a bald eagle has been acquitted by a jury after a federal trial that was conducted much like a murder case. Jurors decided Wednesday there was insufficient evidence linking <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindell </PERSON> to the death of the bird, whose carcass was found last fall in a ditch about a mile from <PERSON> Lindell </PERSON>'s home. <PERSON> Lindell </PERSON> was prosecuted under the 50-year-old Bald Eagle Protection Act, which protects the species as a national symbol and provides for a sentence of up to a year in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. Two acquaintances testified <PERSON> Lindell </PERSON> had bragged about shooting the eagle out of an oak tree. Defense attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> charged that the men were making up the story for revenge. As in many murder cases, experts testified about the cause and circumstances of the death. The bird allegedly was shot in September, but the carcass was not examined by authorities until several months later. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, a chemist with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, testified that he found evidence of lead on one of the eagle's ribs, suggesting it had been shot with a small-caliber weapon But <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> said he did not know enough to say how the bird died. <PERSON> Lindell </PERSON>, who did not testify, said he could not have brought himself to kill a bald eagle. `` I have feeders all over my property.

<TEXT>
 A former secretary in the chancellor's office whose love for a Soviet agent led her to spy for the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> was sentenced Thursday to 6 -LCB- years in prison. <PERSON> Elke </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, 44, was found guilty of passing more than 200 confidential documents to Soviet intelligence agents between 1975 and 1985. The documents included West German intelligence reports, government and Cabinet minutes and information on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> maneuvers. Ms. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty, said she started spying after falling in love with a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agent who recruited her to work for the Soviets. In passing sentence, Chief Judge <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> was a `` willing spy.'' `` Knowingly and with open eyes, she slipped deeper and deeper into espionage and caused great damage to'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the judge said. But <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> also praised Ms. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>'s cooperation with investigators after her arrest in March 1988, saying she gave `` new and important information about the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> methods.'' According to the evidence introduced during the trial, Ms. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> fell in love with a Soviet agent who used the cover name of <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thieme </PERSON>. The agent was never caught. Ms. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> told the court she met <PERSON> Thieme </PERSON> in 1973 through a `` lonely hearts'' newspaper advertisement and considered him `` the man of my life.'' The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agent gave her a miniature camera concealed in a lighter and a hair spray can designed to hide films. Ms. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> worked in several government offices, including the chancellery and the ministries of transport and economic cooperation. Judge <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said the most valuable intelligence material given to the Soviets came after Ms. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> moved to the ministry of economic cooperation in 1979. `` They were not state secrets, but they contained the government's assessment of the international situation,'' he said. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> paid for 23 vacations abroad for Ms. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, during which she met with her lover, who left <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1974. For her 40th birthday, the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> gave her a gold ring as a present, the judge said. The <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court also ordered Ms. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> to turn over to the state the $ 5,200 she received from the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s counterespionage agency for years has warned government secretaries about the so-called `` Romeos'' _ communist agents who start relationships with single women working for the government. In the last major spy scandal to rock the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government, 15 communist agents were arrested or disappeared between August and December 1985. Among them was <PERSON> Hans-Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiedge </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s counterespionage officer in charge of catching East German spies. <PERSON> Tiedge </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 Short-range nuclear arms could be eliminated from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agree on reducing conventional forces, a leading politician in the governing coalition said Thursday. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> seeks East-West negotiations on reductions in the battlefield nuclear weapons, most of which probably would be used on its territory in case of war, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are opposed. Officials in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> said West German leaders, who have pressed <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> for a more favorable attitude toward reforms in the Soviet bloc, would discuss superpower relations with <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign minister. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Thursday and is to visit <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on Friday. About eliminating short-range weapons, <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambsdorff </PERSON> said in a radio interview: `` This is not possible today, but it could be if conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were reduced to levels each side requires for defense.'' <PERSON> Lambsdorff </PERSON> is chairman of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, junior partner in Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s coalition. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, also a Free Democrat, have called for speedy East-West negotiations to reduce short-range weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> say the weapons are an essential part of the Western alliance's efense strategy. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Thursday for more talks on the matter with British counterpart, Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>. In a meeting two weeks ago, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was unable to convince <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to drop his demand for negotiations, which has split the alliance just before a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit scheduled for <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> later in May. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> rejected a proposal by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that the superpowers negotiate reductions in the short-range weapons. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has 88 Lance missile launchers, most of them based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The missiles now have a range of 75 miles, but modernization would increase that to about 250. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is expected to address many topics during his visit to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, including disarmament and relations between the two countries. He will meet with both <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>. Before meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> will see <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> at a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials Friday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. A federal government source said: `` We expect <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will be reporting on the current state of Soviet-American relations. This area is very important and interesting for us.'' In remarks to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on April 27, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said the West `` should support reform processes in all <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries. I urge our European and American friends to help carry out this policy and agree on a common approach.''

<HEAD>Sting Raising Money to Stop Depletion of Amazon Rain Forest</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rock star Sting and <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> tribal leaders made a pitch Thursday for money to stop the depletion of the Brazilian rain forest. `` It's our air conditioning. We produce carbon dioxide with our industry. The rain forest cleans it up. That's a singular service that country is giving us,'' Sting said at a news conference. `` We owe <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> something.'' Depending on the estimates, the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest has been depleted 5 percent to 12 percent, with an area the size of a football field going every five minutes. Much of it is being burned. Ecologists say the vast jungle, as part of the worldwide system dubbed the `` lungs of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' converts carbon dioxide into needed oxygen. Some ecologists warn that the loss of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest contributes to the `` greenhouse effect,'' or global warming. Resources from the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> also are used in production of a significant amount of the world's prescription drugs. Sting, seated with Indian tribal leaders from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, said he was glad attention was now focused on the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>. `` What does n't please me is the emphasis of that attention'' _ the search for a culprit, Sting said. `` If I was a poor Brazilian, had no money, no land, I too would burn the forest. So too would everyone in this room.'' Sting blamed the multinational corporations and the banks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for bleeding <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> with fixed, inflexible interest rates on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation's debt. `` The reason is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is in debt, also,'' said Sting. `` Why? I'd have to say it's because we've wasted our money on nuclear arms, our so-called defense budget. It's the poor people of the world who are paying that.'' The Brazil-based <ORGANIZATION> Rainforest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> hopes to raise $ 4 million to $ 5 million to protect 100,000 square miles that already belong to the Indians with a buffer of trees, observation towers and ranger stations, to buy one or two airplanes, maintain the area and develop cash crops. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> has donated $ 200,000 and other governments have indicated an interest. Members Only, a clothing manufacturer, announced at the news conference that it is devoting its fall advertising program to the campaign to preserve the rain forest. The campaign began last month in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with an audience with President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. The group also has met with the pope. Next stops are <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which has rejected outside interference in the matter, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> has listened to the group, Sting said. `` We have a dialogue,'' Sting said. `` We hope to finesse that dialogue into a successful mission.''

 Elementary school pupils set free 7,000 ladybugs in what their principal called an ecological alternative to an annual balloon launch. Balloons, with notes attached, are often released by school and community groups eager to see how far their messages will travel. Many wind up in fields and wetlands, where the balloons can be fatal to foraging wildlife. The idea to launch ladybugs came from <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Clift </PERSON>, a school volunteer who works at a gardening shop that sells ladybugs as an alternative to pesticides. <PERSON> Clift </PERSON> said she bought seven 1,000-bug bags and donated them to the school. <ORGANIZATION> Chamberlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> pupils prepared for the launch by reading about ladybugs and discussing them in class.

<TEXT>
 Nearly 33,000 Namibian exiles have signed up to return home in a massive airlift that is part of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> plan to bring independence to this mineral-rich territory, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday. Also on Thursday, the territorial government announced security forces killed a black nationalist guerrilla, raising to 313 the number of insurgents the South African-led forces say they have killed since an unexpected April 1 incursion from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bwakira </PERSON>, chief representative in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees, said a five-week repatriation will start May 22, provided the South African-appointed territorial authorities implement an amnesty and repeal racist laws. Both steps are called for in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan to end 74 years of South African rule. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has agreed to grant independence as part of a regional agreement calling for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Most exiles have lived in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> since fleeing <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> during a 23-year guerrilla war waged by the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bwakira </PERSON> said some exiles will return from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> on foot, but most will be flown back. They will be given food rations and cooking utensils and encouraged to leave U.N.-supervised reception centers within a week of arrival, said <PERSON> Bwakira </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Namibian churches are to provide long-term care for 1,500 orphans, elderly and disabled returnees. At a separate news conference, a government spokesman announced the killing of a <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla but gave no details. He said the fighter was among 1,600 guerrillas who infiltrated from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> after April 1. <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> says the incursion violates the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> was not a signatory to the accord signed by <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Saturday marks the end of a two-week period in which <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and security force officials were to verify whether the guerrillas have withdrawn. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says its troops will be confined to base only if a total <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> pullout is confirmed. This will be discussed at a meeting Monday with Angolan and Cuban officials. The guerrillas are to return home, unarmed, with the refugees. It is estimated there are perhaps 58,000 Namibian exiles. <PERSON> Bwakira </PERSON> said 32,950 have registered to be repatriated. Others may register later or decide after independence, scheduled early next year. Most exiles support <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bwakira </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> will seek to ensure their return takes place `` without fear of intimidation, harassment or prosecution.'' The repatriation will cost $ 38 million, of which $ 31 million already has been pledged by Western governments, <PERSON> Bwakira </PERSON> said. It includes $ 10 million from Nordic countries, $ 5 million from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and $ 1 million from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 An unarmed Midgetman missile went off course and was destroyed today during the first test flight of the controversial weapon system, the program director said. The missile began to tumble about 70 seconds into the flight while its second stage was firing and the range safety officer issued a destruct command, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> told reporters. But he called the launch a `` qualified success'' because the flight test met about 50 percent of its objectives. The intercontinental ballistic missile, designed to be fired from a truck launcher, blasted off from a concrete pad at 11 a.m. PDT. The missile was supposed to deliver a dummy warhead to a test range about 4,600 miles away in the <LOCATION> Kwajalein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atoll </LOCATION>. The Midgetman, formally the Small Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, is designed to carry a single nuclear warhead to a target up to 6,900 miles away. The three-stage missile weighs 37,000 pounds, stands about 52 feet tall and is 46 inches in diameter. The weapon is at the center of a controversy over whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should develop one or two mobile nuclear missiles to deter the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from attempting a first strike against missiles inside silos. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has deployed two such `` land-mobile'' missiles, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> none. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> would prefer to develop only one _ a version of the huge, 10-warhead MX that could be carried and launched from a rail car. Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill prefer the smaller, more mobile Midgetman. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently decided, however, to pursue development of both the MX and Midgetman. The major contractors on the Midgetman include <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 The bombings of two <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> state judges' homes 15 miles apart were connected, authorities say, and the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says threats against federal court officials are on the rise. Criminals `` think threatening the judge will solve the problem,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` It kind of goes with the turf, unfortunately,'' said Olmsted County District Judge <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ring </PERSON>, who received several death threats last year after a controversial ruling in the case of a youthful ax murder suspect. `` I do n't think there's been a judge who's been on the bench more than a couple years who has n't had some threats or harassment of some kind,'' said <LOCATION> Anoka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. `` Most of us do n't take it very seriously, and perhaps we ought to,'' said <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Authorities announced Monday that an April 26 blast that severely damaged the Blooming Prairie home of <LOCATION> Freeborn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mork </PERSON> was caused by a bomb. The judge, his wife, and an 18-year-old son were home but escaped injury. Police Chief <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bredeck </PERSON> estimated damage at more than $ 80,000. Fifteen miles away, On May 29, 1988, an explosion and fire destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Mower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Nierengarten </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> No one was home at the time. Both judges serve in southeastern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s Third Judicial District. `` We can certainly link the two. There's no question of it,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastin </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Steele </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> said both explosions caused the same `` crater effect,'' or concussion pattern, and both blew inward into the houses. Blooming Prairie is in <LOCATION> Steele </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. There have been no arrests, and police say they know of no motive for the two bombings. <PERSON> Nierengarten </PERSON> does not speak about the incident, his law clerk said. <PERSON> Mork </PERSON> would not comment, except to express confidence in the investigation. `` By the grace of God we survived the explosion and we are thankful for that. We intend to stand firm and move forward with our lives,'' <PERSON> Mork </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, threats against federal court officials are increasing, said <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which has protected federal judges for nearly 200 years. `` At any one time through the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> we have at least one federal judge under 24-hour protection,'' <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> said. In 1983, 119 threats were received against federal judges, attorneys, jurors and witnesses, <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> said. By 1988, the number had risen to 213, and 152 threats were reported in the first six months of fiscal 1989, he said. <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> attributes the increase to aggressive law enforcement and increased crime, particularly in drug trafficking. `` There's a substantial effort throughout the nation of getting the criminal off the street and to win the war against drugs and put the drug pushers away,'' he said. As for threats against state court judges, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, does not have statistics. But <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Lattimore </PERSON>, a center staff associate, said, `` I think there is a general trend across the country for state courts to be more security conscious, especially judges.'' In several recent cases: _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was temporarily moved from his home and placed under tightened security in 1987 after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> reported a threat against his life. <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> was prosecuting <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, one of the leaders of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine-smuggling <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>. _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON> was slain May 21, 1988, at his home in <LOCATION> Pelham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> by a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> policeman embittered by <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON>'s dismissal of his daughter's lawsuit. _ In another <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolstad </PERSON> was accused in 1987 of kidnapping and raping a girl out of revenge against <LOCATION> Winona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Gernes </PERSON>, one of her relatives. <PERSON> Gernes </PERSON> had twice helped prosecute <PERSON> Bolstad </PERSON> and his brother. `` We're in an adversarial system,'' <PERSON> Gernes </PERSON> said. `` If you're going to be a forceful advocate, you're going to, in some individuals, create hostility which manifests itself in assaults or threats or worse.

 Strong swirling winds called a dust devil tore a giant $ 18 million anti-drug radar balloon from its moorings, causing extensive but repairable damage, a <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, chief of the Customs aviation branch office in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, said an investigative panel will try this weekend to reconstruct what happened Wednesday to the 6 -LCB- - ton Aerostat The blimplike helium balloon is made of lightweight and highly resistant thin materials and is 245 feet long and 72 feet in diameter. `` I think it ripped itself apart by being moored on a pad with a tremendous amount of wind force associated with one of these dust devils,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. A dust devil, a whirlwind or miniature tornado, struck the balloon, which carries a sophisticated, 3,500-pound look-down radar package underneath, and tore it from its mooring pad and caused it to deflate rapidly, he said. Officials said the balloon, which can be tethered up to 10,000 feet in the air, was down because of high winds. The Aerostat, deployed last June and tethered at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, is `` definitely repairable; we've already determined that,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. No one was injured and there was no damage to other property. The service says radar coverage is continuing.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> challenged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies Thursday with two bold weapons-reductions proposals as Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> rejected negotiations over nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered to cut Soviet stockpiles of battlefield nuclear weapons, but <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called the offer `` a good step, ... a small step, ... a modest move.'' `` There has to be a little less of an imbalance,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, reiterating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assessment that the Soviets have a 12-1 advantage in European short-range nuclear missiles. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said that the Soviets would withdraw 500 tactical nuclear warheads from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this year and that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is prepared to pull out all nuclear munitions from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 1991 if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> engineers equivalent steps in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official flying with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> and a briefing for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ministers said the Soviets announced they would take out of service this year 284 short-range missiles, 166 nuclear bombs carried aboard airplanes and 50 nuclear artillery shells. Along with the request to discuss joint reductions in missile stocks, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> moved boldly on conventional arms cuts. He told <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> during their 3 -LCB- - hour meeting at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s first since becoming secretary _ that the Soviets would offer in exchange for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> reductions to cut <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks by 40,000, combat aircraft by 42,000 and artillery pieces by 47,000 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who demanded anonymity, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also proposed a reduction of 1 million troops in both alliances and a 55 percent cutback in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s combat aircraft. By 1997, the official said, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> aims for equal levels of 1.35 million troops in the two alliances, 1,500 strike aircraft, 20,000 tanks, 1,700 helicopters, 24,000 artillery pieces and 28,000 combat vehicles. The Soviet conventional arms proposal will be presented formally Friday at NATO-Warsaw Pact negotiations in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> declined to evaluate the conventional arms proposal. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> it would be up to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance to reply. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> summoned foreign ministers from the six <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for a late Thursday meeting on the conventional arms offer, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announced reductions in Soviet tactical nuclear weapons appeared aimed at pressuring the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to drop plans to modernize its arsenal of 700 Lance missiles and 88 launchers, most in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, backed by several <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, has demanded the negotiations <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> rejected. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> is expected to renew the plea when he meets with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on Friday at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who will return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday night, is striving to resolve the dispute with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> before, or at least during, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting May 29-30 in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will attend with the leaders of the 15 other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries. As for the Soviet missile cutbacks, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> had on its own eliminated 2,400 nuclear weapons since 1979. Only now is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> announcing cuts of its own, amounting to 5 percent of its 10,000-weapon arsenal. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who met separately with reporters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s request for talks on further nuclear weapons cutbacks `` a most important initiative'' designed to produce `` a comprehensive resolution of this question.'' He said that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration position on such talks was `` very negative'' and added, `` This seriously concerns us.'' The Soviets contend that the Lance missiles could be used to deliver a first-strike attack and that their modernization would destabilize <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called his discussions with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` rather extensive and in-depth.'' He said he and the Soviets had agreed to `` continue to disagree agreeably.'' The disagreement on tactical nuclear arms discussions contrasted with an apparent improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations resulting from <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s trip. On two regional fronts there was apparent progress. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reported that the Soviets would cooperate in peace efforts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and that the talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made him optimistic that Soviet military aid to the Marxist government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would be reduced from the current level of about 500 million dollars a year. In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` we think there may be a fair amount of common ground'' on an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal to hold elections among the 1.4 million Palestinians who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. He said the Soviets would help try to persuade <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> and Israelis to convert the election process into a broader peace effort. On human rights, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with a list of Jewish refuseniks who are being allowed to emigrate after years of wating. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> did not say how many would be allowed to emigrate as a result of the talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, but indications were about 100 families would be allowed to go. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> pledged to keep working on behalf of 400 to 500 other families who are still waiting. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said they had a list of about 600 refusenik families. The secretary also noted that the two sides had agreed to resume negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> next month to reduce long-range nuclear weapons and on their space defense programs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the talks would be reopened between June 12-19 with the date to be set later. The two sides also agreed to resume talks on a nuclear test ban on June 26.

 Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> has become the employer of last resort in expensive places such as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, as quality workers are drawn to high-paying private sector jobs, according to a group of federal employees in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> says it is considering pay scales that are more `` market sensitive.'' Private sector salaries rose 22.8 percent from 1984 to 1987 while federal pay rates increased only 10.5 percent, according to a report from the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 27,000 federal employees who earned an average $ 21,724 in 1987. `` The significant pay disparity severely reduces the government's ability to attract and retain good and bright employees who can provide quality, timely, and reliable public goods and services,'' the report said. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> report follows similar studies by boards in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> last year that found the inability to hire a quality workforce has hindered federal agencies. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> is one of the nation's most expensive cities to live in. It has had one of the highest rates of inflation throughout the 1980s, and home prices and auto insurance rates are among the highest in the country. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> also has one of the tightest labor markets. Costs associated with employee turnover and recruitment in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area amounted to $ 60 million or nearly 10 percent of the area's federal payroll, the report said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Brauer </PERSON>, a past head of the <ORGANIZATION> Public-Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Careers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>, said low pay is one of many factors contributing to low morale among federal employees. `` The system now has such serious problems. It's worrisome,'' he said. But it would be difficult to raise the salaries of the rank and file bureaucrats without first raising legislative and judicial salaries. `` Those salaries put a ceiling on everything else,'' <PERSON> Brauer </PERSON> said. A proposed 50 percent salary increase for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, federal judges and high-ranking federal executives got a poor public reaction and was defeated last winter. The report urges broad-based legislation to grant the Office of Personnel Management the authority to regulate federal salaries and keep them in line with shifting labor market and recruitment conditions. Market-based pay, cost of living differentials and recruitment bonuses are among other board recommendations. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy director for pay programs, acknowledged that salaries are partly to blame for difficulties filling positions with qualified candidates. He said the <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> already is considering restructuring the federal pay system to consider regional cost-of-living factors. `` What we're looking into is coming into some alternative approaches for redesigning the system so it would be more market sensitive,'' he said. `` The pay should be more consistent -LRB- with -RRB- the demand for that occupation in a given area.''

<HEAD>Study Calls for Welfare Overhaul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the nation's welfare system needs a $ 29 billion overhaul to expand the social safety net with services like treatment on demand for drug and alcohol problems and long-term care for the elderly Other recommendations include expanding the Head Start program for 3 and 4 year olds, assuring all pregnant women access to prenatal and well-baby care, raising the minimum wage and requiring welfare recipients to work after receiving benefits for a certain period of time. The foundation's report, `` The Common Good: Social Welfare and the American Future,'' is the result of a three-year, $ 3 million study by a panel of business, civic, labor and civil rights leaders and educators. `` The current social welfare system is out of date and severe gaps in protection and opportunity for millions of Americans remain,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, panel chairman. The current system `` leaves too many people dependent and vulnerable at critical stages in their lives,'' he said. The panel recommends financing the broad array of additional welfare, education and health care benefits by taxing Social Security benefits that exceed recipients' lifetime contributions. Such a tax would raise more than half the $ 29 billion annual cost of the recommended programs. The federal government now spends $ 500 billion a year on social programs. The report proposes spending $ 6.2 billion in federal support to expand programs such as Women, Infants and Children, Head Start and Medicaid. All pregnant women would have access to prenatal and well-baby clinics and 900,000 more 3 - and 4-year-olds would participate in the Head Start program States and local governments would be encouraged to begin and strengthen programs to combat teen pregnancies, to reduce the high school drop-out rate and coordinate training and youth guidance programs. About $ 1 billion would be spent to provide drug and alcohol treatment on demand. Also, the estimated 37 million uninsured would be covered by health insurance through a blending of employer-based insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. Employers who did not offer a basic package of health insurance to its workers would be required to contribute to a public fund that would finance coverage for those not working and uninsured. The panel's plan would permit unemployed people to receive lump-sum payments so they can relocate to areas of greater employment opportunities, and the minimum wage would be raised to restore the purchasing power of the 1981 level.

<HEAD>Mayor Calls Police Alcohol Training Session an Embarrassment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An improperly supervised police training session on the effects of alcohol took a wrong turn when a reserve officer had to be hospitalized for drunkenness, the mayor says. Mayor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said one officer was suspended and further disciplinary action is expected because of the May 2 session, which ended with dispatcher <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Offenbacker </PERSON> passing out and being taken by ambulance to <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` Obviously, something went wrong with the way it was done,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said, The <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. `` That drinking is supposed to be a controlled -LRB- situation -RRB-, not getting sloppy fall-down drunk.'' Police Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Officer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lair </PERSON> was suspended for one day because he drove his police car to a part-time security job immediately after taking part in the drinking session. The evening training program in this <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> suburb was designed to educate 15 volunteer reserve officers about the effects of alcohol. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said three dispatchers and two police officers drank alcohol for the session. Reserve officers then observed their behavior, gave sobriety tests and used the Breathalizer machine to measure blood alcohol content. Officer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>, who is certified to teach the training sessions, was in charge. However, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the session was run improperly, without superior officers at the scene. `` There was a lack of supervision,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` Obviously through some unknown means -LRB- Offenbacker -RRB- got beyond the .10 mark, and it was not our intention she get that much.'' A person who has a .10 percent blood-alcohol level is considered legally intoxicated in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. A hospital spokeswoman said <PERSON> Offenbacker </PERSON> was treated in the emergency room and released. She returned to work the next day. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he believes Capt. <PERSON> Lana </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, in charge of training for the police department, should have supervised the program. `` It was an oversight on her part,'' he said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> bought two cases of beer and two bottles of wine for the five drinking participants at a cost of about $ 23, her expense voucher showed. `` I threw in a bottle of <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION>'s whiskey that I had at home because I do n't drink myself,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. Offenbacker had been drinking the whiskey before she fainted, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` This was the first time we had a training session of this nature and we made some mistakes. I'm not sure we'll have a similar training session again,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegates to a forum on press freedom accused four East bloc nations Thursday of doing little to further the cause, and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> urged the nations to drop what it called their `` same tired old excuses.'' The 35-nation forum brought together <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and every European country except <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> to monitor compliance of an accord on improving the information flow between East and West. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian delegations concluded that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> had shown little progress in fulfilling their commitments to the accord, signed in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in January. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> responded to the charges in its concluding statement at the month-long Information Forum, saying the West was not looking at the full picture. Chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that `` very little progress'' had been made with the four East bloc countries. `` We did n't expect to solve all problems, but I do n't feel we accomplished as much as I'd like to have,'' said the former head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Canadian Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said in a speech that some nations remain in a dark age, where the only `` correct facts'' were the government's, contacts with foreigners are taboo, and free communication does not exist. `` The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> meeting has, unfortunately, only reinforced our view that such backward practices remain the norm in some Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> countries,'' he said, referring to the four nations. `` When these countries were justly criticized,'' <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said, `` we were treated to the same tired old arguments'' that criticism was internal interference or deliberately confrontational. The security conference ended in January in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> with agreements committing the 35 signatories to improve the flow of information and improve working conditions for journalists. Czechoslovakian chief delegate <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacil </PERSON>, the only one of the four to speak Thursday, said in his concluding statement that `` confrontation or bias or disinformation ... is counterproductive.'' He said his country was undergoing a `` transitory period'' of instituting reform and a `` new system in all spheres'' would come into effect Jan. 1 next year. <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said the Czechoslovaks had lied about the circumstances of an arrest of a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reporter May 1 during coverage of a dissident protest, saying he had no identity papers despite the fact that they were holding his passport at the time. He and other delegates said reluctance by some <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries to repeat a <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> promise that all the forum's undertakings were binding had kept a final communique from being composed Instead, as called for under the accord, all proposals made at the forum were to be passed to the security conference for consideration. Soviet chief delegate <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyadyshev </PERSON>, a magazine editor, expressed overall satisfaction with the forum, saying it had brought the participants to a `` new level of understanding.'' He refused to comment on criticism of his East bloc neighbors. <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> said they saw encouraging signs of change in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but emphasized this did not mean those countries had completely lived up to their commitments.

<HEAD>Administration Seeks Retargeting of Training Money to Teens And Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Thursday proposed rewriting the nation's premier job-training program to target most spending on the unskilled poor and teen-agers and to hinge some federal money on improvements in state training and education efforts. The program was co-authored by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> when he was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The suggested amendments to the Job Training Partnership Act answer most criticisms of the program and are substantially in line with changes proposed by several congressional Democrats, leading Republicans and Democrats alike to predict passage of a revised <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> this year. `` There is an urgent need for more than job training,'' Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in outlining the administration proposal to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on employment and productivity. `` Many desperately need basic skills training, literacy and remedial education.'' Although the proposed amendments would significantly redirect the program, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said they are needed because of the changing demographics of the American workforce and not because of major flaws in the initial legislation. `` Its record on advancing the employability of disadvantaged youth and adults, and returning dislocated workers to the economic mainstream has been unprecedented,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` But <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> can be made even better.'' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, called <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> `` the singularly important work of this committee during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years.'' But he agreed with Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> that the recession-spawned program needs to be reworked to address current labor shortages, particularly in high-skills fields. The chairman of the subcommittee, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., has introduced a package of similar amendments and expressed confidence minor differences in the approaches would be resolved `` I think we're going to get a good bill out of this committee that we're all going to be able to agree on,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> is by far the nation's largest training program, receiving $ 2.4 billion this year to serve an estimated 1.9 million people. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has requested stable spending for next year. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the proposed amendments would increase per-person training costs and therefore cause some modest reduction in service levels. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, however, said those reductions likely could be offset if states did a better job of coordinating federal, state and other education, training and counseling programs. Current <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> spending formulas send two-thirds of the money to areas based on their unemployment rates. The amendments would make the concentration of economically disadvantaged the overriding factor in spending decisions. Also, youth training programs now scattered throughout sections of <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> that also deal with adult training would be collected into a separate entity, which Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said would allow dramatic improvements in efforts to curb high youth unemployment, particularly in inner cities. During her testimony, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was flanked by three participants in JTPA-funded programs. They sparked applause from subcommittee members when they discussed their troubled childhoods and achievements made possible by the training and education they were receiving. They also met briefly later with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House. Also among the changes proposed by the administration: _ Rewriting eligibility requirements so that in addition to being economically disadvantaged, all youths and half the adults seeking enrollment in <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> programs would need to have additional barriers to employment such as literacy or basic skills deficiences Teen parents and the homeless also would be given preference. _ Rewriting program guidelines to encourage more thorough training, including deletion of provisions that weigh a program's success by the number of placements it Such provisions have been criticized for encouraging programs to select applicants who already have marketable skills so that they can be placed in jobs quickly. _ Requiring, for the first time, that <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> funding for summer jobs programs go only to youths who are enrolled in an approved education or training program during the school year _ Requiring individual assessments of all prospective trainees and for those accepted into programs, an individually tailored program to meet the distinct education, training and placement needs of each trainee _ Establishing grants for states that set clear goals for their training programs and submit to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans that demonstrate improved coordination between training and related programs

<HEAD>USDA: Soviet Grain Harvest Could Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could produce a bumper grain crop this year of 210 million metric tons, up 8 percent from last year's production, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. In its first forecast of 1989 Soviet grain production, the department said prospects stem from `` a relatively good growing season to date.'' But <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s push for greater output of livestock products for Soviet consumers will mean record grain use and `` continued large grain imports'' to cover shortfalls, the report said. The forecast included 91.5 million tons of wheat, 105.5 million tons of coarse grains such as corn and barley, and 13 million tons of `` miscellaneous'' grains and pulses. Last year, when production was 195.1 million tons, the harvest included about 84.4 million tons of wheat, 97.5 million tons of coarse grains, and more than 13.1 million tons of miscellenous crops. If realized, the forecast of 210 million tons would mean that Soviet grain production has exceeded 200 million tons in three of the last four years, an unprecedented production record by that country. The all-time high grain output was 237.4 million tons in 1978. Imports of grain by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the 1989-90 trade year which will begin on July 1 were forecast at 33 million tons, down from 38.5 million tons estimated for the current year but still `` on a par with the average of the past decade,'' the report said. `` The push to increase livestock product output has increased the demand for imported corn and grains for feed,'' the report said. `` In addition, another year of strong wheat prices is likely to discourage -LRB- Soviet -RRB- imports of feed wheat. Total wheat imports are projected to decline to 12 million tons, the lowest level since 1979-80.'' Department analysts said the good outlook for the Soviet grain crop and high world prices for wheat are likely to limit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s wheat imports `` to not much more than the levels required'' under various long-term agreements with supplying countries

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, the retired general enlisted by <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> to run arms to Nicaraguan rebels, was accused in an indictment unsealed Thursday of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cover up his profits from the Iran-Contra affair. The indictment alleges that more than $ 1 million was involved. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, 56, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general who already faced one set of charges in the affair, was accused of seven counts of perjury to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and one count of obstructing the congressional Iran-Contra investigation in 1987. A ninth charge accused him of making a false statement to staff members for the congressional panels by saying he was n't aware that any money generated by his Iran-Contra transactions had benefited North. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on conviction. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was the leadoff witness in the televised hearings conducted in the spring and summer of 1987 by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees. The lastest charges by a federal grand jury were handed up April 7, but were n't unsealed until Thursday in order to avoid bringing them out during the trial of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, who was convicted on three of 12 Iran-Contra counts last Thursday. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s lawyers said in a statement, `` The decision to indict again is vindictive and contrary to any notion of fair play and professionalism.'' They asked for financial assistance to help pay for his defense. Meanwhile Thursday, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was convicted of driving while intoxicated in late February in nearby <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. District Court Judge <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON> found <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> guilty, suspending $ 200 of a $ 500 fine and suspending a 30-day jail term She ordered that he be given a restricted license permitting him to drive between his home, work and an alcohol safety program. The penalties were stayed because <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> appealed to <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circuit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, where his case is to be heard Aug. 24. The new Iran-Contra indictment was issued by a federal grand jury that last fall began investigating possible perjury by various figures in the affair. Asked whether `` other key players'' would face charges, independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> declined to comment. Eight of the new charges relate `` to <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s financial interest in the enterprise which ... delivered weapons to the Contras'' and shipped arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1985 and 1986, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told reporters in front of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse. `` The enterprise'' was the maze of companies set up around the world by <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and business partner <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> to carry out the Contra arms shipments and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. More than $ 47 million `` was received, managed and disbursed,'' said the indictment. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the ninth count relates to alleged lying about a $ 200,000 fund set up through <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and Swiss-based lawyer <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> for <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s family in the event he failed to return from a trip to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1986, and about <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s acceptance of a $ 13,800 home security system. The charge accuses <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> of denying to lawyers for the congressional Iran-Contra panels that he was aware of any money from the enterprise that went to benefit North. The convictions against <PERSON> North </PERSON> included illegally accepting the security system. North testified at his trial that he had n't known about the $ 200,000 death benefit set aside for his wife and children, though he had sent his wife, <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to discuss the matter with <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>. The indictment said <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> lied when he told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>: _ He had no interest in <ORGANIZATION> Korel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a corporation that held his share of the profits from covertly running arms to the Contras and secretly shipping arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` The Korel account, unlike the other enterprise accounts, was set aside for the personal use of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>,'' said the indictment. _ He had waived his interest in profits of the enterprise and <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> had managed `` several hundred thousand dollars, maybe $ 400,000'' for him through the years The indictment said <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> retained a personal interest in the profits of the enterprise and did n't advise <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> he was waiving any interest. It alleged <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> was used `` to manage over a million dollars of profits allocated to the defendant, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON>. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>.'' _ He received only his $ 6,000 a month salary from the arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and to the Contras _ $ 400,000 to $ 500,000 paid to his and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> company was money lent from a Swiss investment services firm operated by <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>'s firm, <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiduciaries </ORGANIZATION>. _ Funds invested in a company called Tri-American Arms came from <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and not from profits of the enterprise He also was accused of lying by denying that one purpose of the Tri-American venture was to sell arms to the Contras. _ <ORGANIZATION> Defex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, a shell corporation was used by the enterprise to disguise the source and location of enterprise money from arms dealers Instead, says the indictment, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and others used <ORGANIZATION> Defex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> `` to hide and disguise from Contra leaders and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials the true prices the enterprise was paying for weapons for the Contras, and the profits they were taking for themselves.'' _ He had no beneficial interest in any foreign accounts Previously, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was indicted on March 16, 1988, along with <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s boss, former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. All four men were accused of conspiracy and theft of government property in illegally diverting more than $ 14 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. The conspiracy and theft counts against North were dropped due to national security concerns. Other charges against <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> from March 1988 were wire fraud, conspiracy to pay an illegal gratuity, offer of an illegal gratuity and payment of an illegal gratuity.

<TEXT>
 The bizarre flight of an enraged ex-husband who commandeered a <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> and flew among city buildings while firing randomly at the ground below reminded operators of small airports of their vulnerablility. `` What can you do to prevent someone from going in and terrorizing people?'' asked <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` You just have to play the odds,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, manager of the Beverly municipal airport where the gunman hijacked the small plane. `` You go along for years and years and nothing happens. Then all of a sudden everything goes haywire.'' <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, who also is accused of murdering his ex-wife, was arraigned Wednesday in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> on charges of murder and armed robbery. Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> held without bail for 20 days of psychiatric observation at <ORGANIZATION> Bridgwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The sniper flight early Wednesday struck a chord among airport officials struggling with security. The rampage began with the hijacking of the single-engine plane at <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION>, about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The episode ended three hours later at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, one of the nation's largest facilities At both facilities, the hijacker had officials backed into a corner. In <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION>, flight instructor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Golder </PERSON> was alone and had little choice but to comply with <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s demand for a plane. `` When you have an AK-47 -LRB- assault rifle -RRB- stuck up your nose and someone ask you to provide an airplane, you just ask them what color airplane they'd like,'' <PERSON> Amero </PERSON> said. `` It's wise to back off.'' And during the flight, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> buzzed <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> and sent air traffic controllers scrambling from the tower, closing the airport. `` Something like this was impossible to anticipate in terms of security,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlandella </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>. `` And I'm not sure there's a defense for it anyway The whole city was helpless.'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s flight ended about 1:15 a.m. Wednesday when he landed at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> with about five minutes' worth of fuel left in his tank. He had no comment, and authorities found no weapon in the plane although several rounds and spent shell casings were recovered. <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said that ideally, stringent security measures would be mandated at all of the nation's 15,000 small airports and landing strips. `` But it would be impossible,'' he said. `` You really ca n't prepare for events like these I do n't know what you could do in the way of security without imposing a tremendous economic burden on small airport operators.'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Amero </PERSON>, who manages the <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, whose plane <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> commandeered, agreed. `` At airports such as Beverly there really is no security,'' he said. `` Generally speaking all we can do is band together as a group of fixed base operators and try to hire security, but the cost is prohibitive.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a senior claims representative at <ORGANIZATION> AVEMCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, Md.-based small aircraft insurer, one of the nation's largest, receives eight to 10 theft reports annually. Because a single-engine plane like a <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 210 is valued at about $ 196,000, costs can quickly soar for insurers like <ORGANIZATION> AVEMCO </ORGANIZATION>, which spends about $ 1 million annually in compensation for stolen and damaged aircraft. `` The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> incident was certainly an exception,'' he said. `` Naturally, we like to see solid security using the best surveillance technology.''

<HEAD>USDA Says Winter Crops Smallest in 11 years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers soon will be harvesting a skimpy winter wheat crop estimated at 1.43 billion bushels, the smallest in 11 years, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Although farmers boosted plantings, this year's harvest is expected to be down 8 percent from last year's 1.56 billion bushels because of lingering drought in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and some of the other major production areas. Officials said the average yield, based on indications as of May 1, was estimated at 34.9 bushels per harvested acre, compared with last year's 39.2 bushels per acre. Farmers are expected to have about 41.0 million acres for harvest this year, up 3 percent from 39.8 million in 1988, said the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>, said drought in the central <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and freeze damage in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> have hurt farmers deeply. `` As a result, farmers in these areas deserve to receive federal assistance similar to that offered last year'' when drought devastated the northern plains and the Corn Belt, he said. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 3.9 billion emergency aid package to help relieve some of the drought damage. Many have urged <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to administratively extend the major benefits to 1989 wheat producers who have had similar losses, but the administration says it is up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The new estimates provide `` solid evidence of this season's losses, and conditions will probably get worse rather than better,'' <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON> said in a statement issued here The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> wheat crop was estimated at 202.4 million bushels, less than two-thirds of the state's 1988 production. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s harvest showed a comparable decline, with output estimated at 68.9 million bushels against 108.5 million last year Despite the sharp losses in the winter wheat areas, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said the effect will be mild on shoppers. `` It's going to be small, but it will have an effect,'' he said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said a $ 1 loaf of bread has about seven cents worth of wheat in it. Theoretically, he said, if the cost of wheat doubled the loaf would still cost only $ 1.07. But he emphasized again that was a theoretical example. Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following summer. It makes up about three-fourths of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat production. The remainder is planted in the spring. No 1989 production estimates for spring wheat, corn and other major spring-planted crops were included. Those will be issued by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> later in the growing season. However, in a related supply-and-demand report, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projected _ based on assumptions of normal weather and `` trend'' yields _ that total wheat production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year could be about 2.05 billion bushels, up from last year's 1.81 billion bushels. The report showed wheat prices could rise to a range of $ 3.80 to $ 4.20 per bushel, on the average, in 1989-90 from $ 3.74 estimated for the current marketing year that will end on May 31. At the higher prices, wheat exports would drop significantly to 1.15 billion bushels from 1.46 billion bushels currently, the report showed. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpile on June 1, 1990, would be drawn down to around 500 million bushels from 594 million bushels estimated this June 1. The report also projected the 1989 corn crop at 7.85 billion bushels, up from the drought-riddled harvest of 4.92 billion last year. Soybeans were indicated at 1.95 billion bushels, up from 1.54 billion in 1988. But the projections were described as `` highly tentative'' subject to change as the season progresses.

<HEAD>Armenians Mass to Demand Freedom for Activists, Parliament Session</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 300,000 Armenians, chanting and carrying Armenian flags, massed Thursday in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to demand action on the disputed territory of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and freedom for imprisoned nationalists, activists said. The situation in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, where unrest broke out again recently after four months of calm, was called `` tense and even explosive,'' activist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Martirosian </PERSON> said in a telephone interview after the protest in the Armenian capital. He said speakers at the demonstration, which was officially condoned, called for a session of the Armenian parliament to address the status of the disputed region. If no session is held by May 18, they recommended a general strike, he said. The crowd also demanded the `` liberation, immediately and without too much talk,'' of 13 Armenian activists under arrest, said <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, another activist contacted by telephone. Most of the 13 are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which organized repeated protests about the region. People at the demonstration chanted `` Committee, committee,'' and `` Session, session,'' <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said. The recent unrest in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> involved strikes and clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, including a village brawl fought by 200 people. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> became the flashpoint for tensions between the two peoples last year, when the Armenians, who are generally Christian and make up three-quarters of the region's 162,000 inhabitants, began demanding that their homeland be transferred from the rule of largely Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and annexed by <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. After more than 90 people died in unrest there, the region was placed under special administrative control by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but Armenians consider the `` current government has not justified itself, everything it does goes against the will of Armenian <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> residents,'' said <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>. Speakers at the meeting described how more and more Azerbaijanis were being settled in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, threatening the Armenian majority and its claim to the region, <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said. He said beginning Friday, meetings will be held at Armenian workplaces to pass resolutions demanding the parliamentary session and threatening a strike if it is not held. Meanwhile, in the neighboring <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, small groups circulated through the capital of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> carrying signs demanding the release of Georgian political prisoners, an activist said. <PERSON> Manana </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON>, wife of jailed political dissident <PERSON> Zviad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON>, said three of the protesters were detained and one remained in jail Thursday night. They were calling for the release of six activists arrested in connection with ethnic unrest April 9 that left 20 dead. <PERSON> Zviad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON>, who was among those arrested after the clash between Soviet troops and pro-independence protesters, is in poor health, but officials have not let him move from his cell to the prison infirmary, <PERSON> Manana </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. She also said strikes were spreading in the Georgian region of <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>, where Abkhazians, although a minority in their own region, have begun demanding secession from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Many Georgian residents of <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> have gone on strike to protest the Abkhazian demkands, she said.

<HEAD>Study Says Renewable Energy Supplies To Double By 2000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Renewable energy sources, such as hydro and solar power, could provide as much as 80 percent of the nation's energy needs by the year 2010 if federal aid were accelerated, an environmental group said in a study published Thursday `` Renewable energy technologies offer one of the most promising components of any strategy to mitigate the trend toward climate change ...,'' the study said. Public Citizen, the study's sponsor, said the potential for renewable energy can only be reached if the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spends substantially more on research and development. The group, which strongly advocates reduced reliance on nuclear power and fossil fuels that are linked to the trend toward global climate warming, said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> budget for renewables should be restored to the 1985 level of $ 263 million. The current budget provides $ 115.6 million, and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has proposed cutting that to $ 86.5 million in the next fiscal year. Renewable energy sources currently supply about 8 percent of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> energy needs, including imports of electricity generated from Canadian hydro plants, the study said. The figure could rise to 19 percent by the year 2000, and to as high as 80 percent by 2010 if prices for conventional energy sources go up, it said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health officials Thursday advised <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> travelers to <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> to make sure their measles shots are up to date following a measles outbreak in there. More than 1,600 cases of measles have been reported in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> since late December, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said.

The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> recommends that all people 15 months and older who were born after 1956 should receive measles vaccinations. In addition, travelers abroad in that age group should receive a booster shot unless there is a medical reason why they should n't. `` All persons planning to travel to <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> or to other areas with ongoing measles activity, including those -LRB- measles-prone -RRB- areas within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, should ensure that their measles vaccination status is adequate,'' the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report.

 Syrian gunners lobbed shells at two <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> harbors Thursday, killing at least two people hours after <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> envoys called a new cease-fire to halt two months of fierce artillery battles. Police said at least three rockets hit two adjacent apartments in <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION>, a mile southeast of the port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, killing two people, including a 10-year-old girl. A police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that eight people were wounded, all relatives of <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>. The casualties raised the toll to 359 people killed and 1,393 wounded in the two-month battle, the latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. Nearly all the casualties have been civilians. Police reported 20 people killed and 62 wounded by rockets, howitzer shells and mortar fire before the truce deadline Thursday afternoon. Also Thursday, rockets fired from multi-barreled launchers in Syrian-policed west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> fell on <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Byblos </ORGANIZATION>, another port in the Christian enclave north of the capital. No casualties were reported. In another development, a statement purportedly signed by an Iranian-backed extremist group believed to hold two American hostages warned against the deployment of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> observers to monitor the latest cease-fire. The typewritten Arabic-language statement, signed by the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>, was delivered to a western news agency in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. There was no authenticating picture of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> or <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, who are held by the group. Islamic Jihad repeatedly has said that statements attributed to it are not genuine unless accompanied by a hostage picture or videotape. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was abducted March 16, 1985. He is the longest held of the 16 foreigners missing and believed held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 57, acting dean of agriculture at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>, was abducted June 9, 1985. The statement warned against the deployment of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> observers but did not mention any demands. Earlier, <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> assistant secretary-general, told reporters the warring <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem factions had agreed on a truce set for 2:30 p.m. The league's four previous calls for a halt to the shelling had little effect on the battle between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian army units and a Moslem alliance of Syrian troops and Druse militiamen. Ibrahimi, an Algerian, and <PERSON> Abdel-Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Jassem </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> diplomat, have been trying to revive an April 28 cease-fire that collapsed after only a few days. After meeting with acting Premier <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> said the first objective is `` normalizing the situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'' so the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee can try to end the civil war. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> has led a Moslem cabinet and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> a competing Christian government since a political crisis in September. The army also split, with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> leading the 20,000 Christians and Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> taking command of the 22,000 Moslems. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> team met with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> at the shell-scarred presidential place in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A military spokesman at <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s headquarters said <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> gunners fired `` 126 shells, most of them 240mm mortars, into the palace before the Arab envoys' arrival.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 53, lives in the palace bunker with his wife, <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON>, and three daughters. On Wednesday, the delegation met in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharaa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and is the country's main power broker. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> imposed a naval blockade March 6 on three illegal ports operated by Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s Druse militia responded with artillery fire two days later Syrian forces soon joined <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>'s army troopers helped seal off the 310-square mile Christian enclave and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> declared a `` war of liberation'' to force <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The government crisis began when the six-year term of President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> expired in September and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> could not agree on a successor. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the army commander, and Moslems swore allegiance to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, the incumbent premier.

<HEAD>Import Assault Rifle Ban May Become Permanent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is considering stiffer gun-control measures including a permanent ban on some semi-automatic assault weapons for an anti-crime package to be announced soon, administration sources said Thursday. The options being considered include making permanent the temporary import ban on a variety of semi-automatic assault rifles that was imposed in March and increasing criminal penalties for illegal use of firearms, according to one of two sources, who both spoke on condition of anonymity. The administration is also studying increased penalties for the illegal possession of semi-automatic weapons and their use in the commission of crimes, according to another source. The proposals are in the final stages of review by White House domestic policy chief <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>. The anti-crime legislative package is expected to be unveiled Monday by the president. Under consideration is a proposal that would bar people sentenced to at least six months in jail for misdeanors from purchasing guns, said the second source. Federal law currently bans convicted felons from owning guns. Another measure under consideration is a proposal to link gun dealers to a federal registry to determine if weapons purchasers are convicted criminals, the second source said. Public concern about the use of military-style assault weapons, such as the AK-47 used by a gunman to kill five children in a <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> schoolyard last January, has prompted the administration review of gun-control policies. In March, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> imposed a temporary import ban on a variety of foreign-made semi-automatic assault weapons while the agency determines if any of them are being used for legitimate sporting purposes. Federal law prevents the importation of such weapons unless they are used for target shooting or hunting. One of the options under consideration is a plan to permanently ban 15 foreign and domestic-made military-style assault weapons, the source said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agents investigating <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will be allowed to examine records of his bank accounts, two high court judges ruled Thursday. Customs and Excise Department officials unexpectedly discovered the accounts and private documents in October during a raid on the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. A lower court judge had barred the Customs and Excise agency from releasing information on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s accounts to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. The documents will not be turned over for at least two weeks, allowing the judges to prepare a written opinion and giving the bank an opportunity to appeal.

 A woman facing a manslaughter charge in her baby's cocaine-related death says the case worsened the pain of the `` worst time of my life.'' <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s 2-day-old baby, <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON>, died Feb. 4. Authorities blamed the death on prenatal brain damage caused by cocaine use during pregnancy and charged the mother with involuntary manslaughter and delivering a controlled substance to a minor. `` I loved her, I did,'' Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who had been without legal counsel, accepted an offer of free representation from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> said Thursday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Winnebago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Logli </PERSON> says he filed the charges in an effort to protect children. But some legal, public-health and medical officials say fear of prosecution could prevent drug-abusing mothers-to-be from seeking help for themselves and their fetuses. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 24, refused to discuss the allegations that her drug abuse was responsible for her daughter's death. But her position on what government officials should do in such cases was clear in the interview Wednesday. `` They should help people,'' Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. `` I tried to get help, but I did n't get any.'' She does not have a telephone and could not be reached to elaborate, but her <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorney, <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, said most drug-abuse treatment programs will not accept pregnant women. `` This prosecution represents an unprecedented intrusion on a woman's constitutionally protected rights of privacy,'' Ms. <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> was arrested Monday, more than three months after <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON>'s death, as she waited for her 6-year-old son, <PERSON> Damen </PERSON>, to come home from school. She was freed on $ 3,500 bail Tuesday and faces a May 31 court hearing. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said she was with <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Rockford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> when the child died. `` It was the worst time of my life,'' she said, `` and this is even worse.'' A conviction on the involuntary manslaughter charge is punishable by two to five years in prison. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> could face a maximum 14-year sentence on the drug charge, <PERSON> Logli </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Faced with his first crisis as president, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has decided on a measured response to the tumultuous situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, concerned that more decisive action could imperil longer-term <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests in the area. He said he was sending troops `` to protect the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens.'' But he ordered no direct military action and no new economic sanctions against the government of <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> warned of the consequences of failing to send a `` clear signal'' to the `` enemies of constitutional rule'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and elsewhere. But the seven points <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined indicated that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is to be overthrown, it will have to be primarily the work of Panamanians and not Americans. The president obviously is hoping that other democratic nations will close ranks against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and that the Panamanian's resulting isolation will encourage him to move on to other pursuits Since Sunday's national election, a number of countries have expressed varying degrees of indignation about the irregularities reported by hundreds of international observers. These countries include <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. And <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> is leading a campaign to have the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> take a strong stand for democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. If this fails to impress <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, he might still take note of the most controversial step <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced _ the dispatch of 2,000 or more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat troops. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> may be concerned that the troops have a more aggressive purpose in mind than the stated one of protecting American lives. It is not unusual for a strong nation to try to achieve political goals by projecting military power without actually using it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backed away from a more pugnacious military response out of concern that it could provoke anti-American uprisings in the hemisphere. That approach might have succeeded in ousting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but the diplomatic costs would have been exorbitant. Slapping a trade embargo on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would have made the economy there scream, but the impact would have been felt for years to come _ long after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure. So <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is relying on rhetoric and diplomacy to weaken <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, after declaring that the opposition candidate in Sunday's election, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, won the election, is now calling him `` president-elect.'' It is a tactic aimed at robbing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> even further of any claim to legitimacy. As for the diplomatic approach, the administration will be lobbying hard over the next few days for a strong resolution at the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers meeting expected to start next Tuesday. Based on the regular <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> permanent council meeting on Wednesday, the prospects are not bright. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryce </PERSON>, delivered a strong attack on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s perceived attempts to steal Sunday's election but only three of the 30 other hemispheric countries joined in the criticism _ <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated that his bag of anti-Noriega reprisals was not exhausted in Thursday's speech. `` We do not rule out,'' he said, `` further steps in the future.''

 Army troops fatally shot two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers Thursday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said, and hundreds of Israelis screaming `` Death to the Arabs!'' stoned Arab-owned cars in a protest over the slaying of a soldier. Palestinians staged a general strike in the occupied territories to mourn the 471 Arabs killed in the 17-month uprising against Israeli rule. Twenty-one Israelis also have been killed. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, activists blocked roads with rocks, hung outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags from electricity poles, and covered walls with graffiti saying `` No to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s Elections!'' Government officials said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s coalition government remains split on party lines about how to conduct elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure for a detailed proposal. In southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, hundreds of people waving anti-Arab banners and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags marched near the port city of <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION> to protest the slaying of an army sergeant and the disappearance of a second soldier. Demonstrators stoned several Arab-owned cars, and at one point menaced two terrified <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> pedestrians who were rescued by police. `` We're going to liberate <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION>. No Arab will work here!'' one woman in the crowd yelled, referring to the coastal cities just north of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Both soldiers disappeared in the area, and authorities blame Arabs. The slain soldier's body was found last week after he was missing almost three months, and the other soldier dissapeared last week. The incidents have sparked anti-Arab outbursts and demands for tougher measures to crush the Palestinian rebellion. In <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION>, police detained three Israelis for attacking a store owner who employed Palestinians, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zilker </PERSON> said the municipality barred 21 <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> merchants from working at an outdoor market Thursday for fear that their presence would spark anti-Arab riots. He said the town council will meet Sunday to discuss measures to reduce the number of Arabs working in <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION>. Gazans make up 5 percent of the work force in <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION> and are primarily employed in low-paying industries and as gardners and street cleaners. On Thursday, Transport Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsav </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc demanded that troops seal off the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> for three months, barring Arabs from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and journalists from covering the uprising. The free movement of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> `` has become dangerous. They have kidnapped soldiers and murdered soldiers,'' <PERSON> Katsav </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman refused to comment on the proposal. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of Sheikh <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON>, troops shot and killed an Arab teen-ager in a clash with stone-throwers, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. Arab hospital officials identified the youth as <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jadallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jadallah </PERSON>, 17. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, troops fired at stone-throwers, fatally shooting 17-year-old <PERSON> Salmi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaff </PERSON> in the chest, the army said. Arab hospital sources reported 16 Palestinians wounded by army gunfire, including 12 in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> where troops enforced a curfew confining 700,000 Palestinians to their homes for a fourth day. The army said it was checking the casualty reports. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police arrested a squad of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> activists for planting bombs in Jewish Sabbath bread last October. The bombs wounded three girls. Maariv newspaper quoted senior government officials as saying that once the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> approves an election plan, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will prepare to hold the balloting even if Palestinians do n't agree. `` Preparations for elections and the decision on who will be entitled to vote and run will be assigned to the office of the coordinator of activities in the territories,'' Maariv said. `` The military government will constitute the source of authority for autonomy, and will issue a special order for this purpose,'' it said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> back elections, and government officials Thursday said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers asking for detailed plans on the proposed vote. Among points he raised were international supervision of balloting and the participation of 140,000 Palestinians from Israeli-annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc is opposed to the east Jerusalemites voting, while its left-leaning coalition partner, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is in favor. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and leading Palestinians in the occupied lands say they will accept elections only as part of a comprehensive peace plan, including an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commitment to exchange land for peace.

 Saturday marks the fourth anniversary of the confrontation between the MOVE group and city officials that ended with an airborne police bomb that incinerated an entire block and killed 11 people. Officialdom has spent four years trying to sort out what went wrong. About two dozen lawsuits have been filed against the city and its four top officials at the time of the disaster. The city already has paid about $ 2 million in claims to neighborhood residents for damages to their property. Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> appointed a blue-ribbon investigating commission to report on the man-made disaster. It accused the mayor of gross negligence in his handling of MOVE, a radical group, and called for grand jury indictments in the deaths of the five children. Two grand juries investigated but no one was indicted. On Friday, attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowser </PERSON> will publish `` Let The Bunker Burn: The Final Battle With MOVE,'' a 150-page book which contends the people in the house were executed by their local government and it could happen again. `` I had to write this book,'' said <PERSON> Bowser </PERSON>, who served on a special city commission investigating the disaster. He believes someone should have been indicted for what happened. `` We think there is a deliberate effort to sweep it under the rug,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Meek </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> MOVE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group sponsoring a memorial service and seminars this weekend on the May, 13, 1985, disaster. `` Many people in the city would like to forget that it happened _ they'd like to pretend that it did n't happen,'' <PERSON> Meek </PERSON> said. `` But it did happen, and it was our government that did it, not some government far away.'' Last December, <PERSON> Meek </PERSON> said, his committee mailed questionnaires to 70 local, state and federal legislators from the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area, asking pointed questions about MOVE and its aftermath. They got three responses. `` I was surprised not to hear from a lot of people,'' he said. `` A veil of silence has been put over this.'' The 1985 confrontation began when police evacuated the block in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, seeking to arrest some members of the radical group at their rowhouse fortress and to evict the others. Police had clashed with MOVE in August 1978, when one police officer died and three police officers and five firefighters were wounded. When police ordered the 1985 eviction, the adult MOVE members refused to come out and kept their children with them, cursing the police through bullhorns and promising to fight them. A state police helicopter finally dropped a satchel on the roof that contained a crudely rigged plastic explosive device. It started the fire that went out of control, destroying the MOVE house and 60 other homes on the block.

The committee was named after <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, came to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and formally notified lawmakers the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeached <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> on Wednesday on grounds he lied to a federal grand jury. Standing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> read the three articles of impeachment approved 417-0 and declared the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` demands his conviction and appropriate judgment thereon.'' The lawmakers then voted to summon <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, now imprisoned at <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, to answer the charges. He faces a trial in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that will decide whether he should be ousted from the bench and deprived of the $ 89,500 annual salary that he still collects as a federal judge. He becomes eligible for parole in November and has indicated a desire to return to his courtroom and resume hearing trials. Appointed to the evidence-hearing committee were Sens. Wyche <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga.; <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala.; <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo.; <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev.; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, D-Va.; <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, D-Wis.; <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>;; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Vt </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION> The panel plans to meet Tuesday to get organized.

 `` Today'' co-host <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>, showing a bit of trepidation, made his first appearance Thursday on the turf of late-night talk-show host <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> since the two began feuding four years ago. <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>'s unannounced visit to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' came at the top of the show as <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> was reading the night's customary top-10 list _ this one of questions asked prospective <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> employees. Number 7 in the countdown list was, `` Any problem car-pooling with <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>?'' Number 4 was, `` Want to join squad doing inventory of <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>'s suits?'' whereupon bandleader <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> complained that <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> should lay off <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>, because `` he might get mad.'' <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> said he would prove <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> could take a joke, went to a studio door and brought <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> into the studio _ after <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> hesitated and pointed at the floor: `` This studio?'' he said. `` Is this the line of doubt?'' <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> read the rest of the list, including No. 2, `` You would n't leak a guy's memo, would you?'' a reference to the now-infamous memo <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> wrote to the `` Today'' producer complaining about most of his colleagues on the show. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> noted how long it had been since <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> had been on the show. `` What, did you change your phone?'' he asked. `` I get lost,'' said <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>. The two shook hands and <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> left. `` I told you he was n't upset,'' <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> `` You two are the Jagger-Richards of television,'' observed <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, referring to the rocky relationship of ex-Rolling Stones <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. The Gumbel-Letterman patchup apparently is genuine. A spokesman for the show said during an afternoon run-through, the two tossed a football and were `` very amiable.'' Their feud began when <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> interrupted a live, prime-time `` Today'' special by shouting from a window. <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> said the stunt was unprofessional. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> had no sense of humor, and besides, he had the `` Today'' producer's permission for the practical joke.

They say the health care of many Americans, particularly those in rural areas, will be threatened as more hospitals close their doors due to financial pressures, including proposed cuts in Medicare reimbursements. The report, however, said the `` hospitals that closed in 1987 were small and had low occupancy rates. When the hospitals closed, few patients were affected. Most could get medical care nearby.'' According to the inspector general, 69 general, acute care hospitals closed in 27 states in 1987, while 13 new hospitals opened that year. Eight of the 69 that closed in 1987 reopened the next year, the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, by contrast, said 79 community hospitals closed in 1987 and more than 400 have closed since 1980. Industry experts project that several hundred more will close in the next few years unless financial pressures are eased. The report made no projections and looked only at 1987. No single factor was responsible for the closings, the report said. But the common elements include declining revenues due to fewer admissions, cuts in insurance reimbursements and more treatment of uninsured patients who can not pay their bill. Other factors include rising costs resulting from pressures to add new medical technology and skilled personnel, the report said. The 1987 closings accounted for 1.3 percent of all hospitals nationally, and one half of 1 percent of the general acute care inpatient bed supply. About 54 percent, or 37, of the hospitals that closed were in rural areas and 46 percent, or 32, of them were urban hospitals. Also, the hospitals that closed had about the same <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid utilization rates as other hospitals. The report said that despite the closings, most of the affected communities still had adequate emergency and inpatient medical services available nearby. In 19 of the 37 communities where hospitals closed, residents have to travel less than 10 miles for emergency care, and 29 less than 20 miles. In seven communities the ride is up to 30 miles, and it's 75 miles _ an hour by ambulance _ to the nearest emergency services for residents in <LOCATION> Mullen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, but in all those areas, ground or air ambulance services are available, the report said. All but one of the 32 urban areas where hospitals closed have emergency care available within 10 miles. The exception is <LOCATION> Wasco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where residents have to travel 19 miles to <LOCATION> Delano </LOCATION>, the report said.

<HEAD>Reye Syndrome Down Sharply In This Decade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Reye syndrome, a potentially fatal disease associated with aspirin in childhood flu and chicken pox cases, has reached the lowest reported level since its discovery _ just 20 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cases last year, officials said Thursday. At its peak in 1980, Reye syndrome struck 555 people. The disease struck 101 Americans in 1986 _ the year in which aspirin containers were first required to carry warnings about it. Since then, <PERSON> Reye </PERSON> syndrome reporting dropped to 36 cases in 1987 and 20 in 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported. Reye syndrome, first observed in the 1950s, causes symptoms including severe vomiting and lethargy, and can result in coma and even death. It usually occurs in children and is usually preceded by a bout with a viral illness such as influenza or chicken pox. Researchers have documented a link between the use of aspirin by young patients during chicken pox or flu and the subsequent development of Reye syndrome. `` The decline in the number of RS cases since late 1980 coincides with the increased publicity about this association,'' the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` That is the reason,'' concluded Dr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schonberger </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researcher. `` Study after study shows aspirin is the primary cause of Reye syndrome. ... <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s been pushing this since 1980.'' The 1988 count is the lowest since national surveillance of <PERSON> Reye </PERSON> cases began in 1976, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Nine of the 20 reported Reye syndrome patients in 1988 had suffered respiratory illness such as flu before the onset of <ORGANIZATION> Reye </ORGANIZATION>; four had chicken pox. The previous year, 18 of the 36 patients had respiratory illnesses, and seven had chicken pox. In 1988, as in 1987, most cases occurred in January, February or March, the peak months for flu or chicken pox cases.

 <PERSON> Rhunetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Crumel </PERSON> is one person who thinks <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> should not be fighting so hard against <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to buy it for more than $ 2 billion Opportunity is knocking for Avon, says Mrs. <PERSON> Crumel </PERSON>, who has reason to know: She is both an Avon representative and an Amway distributor. The takeover battle between the two giants of direct sales will directly affect nearly 3 million people worldwide, roughly 1.5 million representing <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> and more than 1 million from <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s stock fell 37 -LCB- cents a share to $ 39.50, still slightly above <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 39-a-share offering price, on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. The spread indicated speculators were betting a higher bid would emerge from Amway or another suitor. Avon is attempting to portray <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> as a maverick company that has had numerous brushes with the law and sweeps up recruits to its sales force through exploitative business evangelism. In a federal lawsuit this week, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> has paid fines of more than $ 20 million in connection with charges involving customs duties and recruiting of distributors. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> `` touts with religious fervor the development of a multi-layered distribution scheme in which the people at the top of the pyramid become wealthy through sales by those below them of any and every product known to man,'' the lawsuit says. Not true, said Mrs. <PERSON> Crumel </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who quit her job at <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> five years ago to devote more time to her Amway distributorship. People who dislike <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> simply do n't understand it, she said `` There are two things you ca n't penetrate. The first is ignorance and the second is laziness,'' she said. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> said its board would evaluate <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s offer but noted that the board has said previously that the company is not for sale. In the latest development, <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that if it acquired <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> it would sell off <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s higher-priced retail-store fragrance lines, stripping the company down to the manufacture and direct sales of perfumes, cosmetics, toiletries and household items. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> had no response to the statement, made in a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing. `` They would be beautiful together,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crumel </PERSON> said in a phone interview from her northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> home after <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> made its takeover offer Wednesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Crumel </PERSON> thinks <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> distributors would benefit by adding <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> to their product line, while <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> could learn from <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s rah-rah approach to recruiting and caring for its distributors <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> is no pyramid as <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> charges, Mrs. <PERSON> Crumel </PERSON> said. Although recruiters get a percentage of their recruits' sales, the recruits can easily end up making more money than the recruiters, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Crumel </PERSON> said big-ticket items and the bonus structure make it easier to make money as an Amway distributor. And she said <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> takes care of its people better. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> treated its representatives as `` stepchildren'' while it went on an ill-fated diversification drive, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s chief operating officer, said in an interview. In fact, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> lost more than $ 400 million last year from the expense of retrenching by selling most of its health care businesses to focus on its core businesses of beauty and direct sales. <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaume </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> resident who sells only Avon, said she knows little about <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> and is not sure she likes what she has heard. No problem, said Mrs. <PERSON> Crumel </PERSON>. `` For the people who are willing to hang around and learn what <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> is all about, I think they'd be very happy.''

<HEAD>Bush To Announce Negotiations For Waiving Trade Limits On Soviets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is poised to announce he will negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for lifting restrictions on trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> if the Kremlin reforms its emigration policies, administration sources said Thursday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will make his announcement at a speech Friday at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the sources, who spoke only on condition they not be identified. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to announce he is asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to waive a 1974 law which links trade concessions for Communist countries with emigration performance, the sources said. The waiver will be granted if the Soviets fulfill their promise to codify new emigration laws and `` faithfully implement'' them, the sources said. His planned announcement follows the first round of talks between the administration and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, conducted this week by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with a list of Jewish refuseniks who are being allowed to emigrate after years of waiting, part of a surge of Jews and other minorities being let out under the liberalized policies of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Last month, 4,557 Jews left, the highest monthly figure since October of 1979, the year emigration reached an annual high of 51,320. As many as 70,000 Soviets are expected to be allowed out this year. The 1974 law withholds credit guarantees and import duty reductions from <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> countries which prevent emigration. Only <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> have been granted a waiver and been accorded `` most favored nation'' status, which gives them lower import duties when they sell goods to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Soviets have promised that under new laws, strict definition would be given to eligibility for emigration. Specifically, the new laws would limit the number of years that have to elapse before a person with knowledge of state secrets is allowed to leave. Soviet authorities have used the provision of their existing law to ban some Jews from leaving for life. Former Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanik </PERSON>, who co-authored the 1974 law, recently called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to waive the restriction for one year to encourage further improvements in human rights under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Vanik </ORGANIZATION>'s plea has been endorsed by several <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish groups who used to be at the forefront of restricting trade with the Soviets. Formal approval of the waiver by Jewish groups would ensure support for such a move in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Grumpy the lawn dwarf is home safe after a five-week whirlwind tour of the country, but his owners have no idea who treated the snarling statue to a vacation. Grumpy, a 20-inch, 80-pound concrete statue of the character in the Walt Disney movie classic, `` Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' disappeared from <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>'s porch March 16 while the couple was out. `` When we came back, I could n't set my finger on it, but I felt something was missing,'' <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said. `` The next morning my daughter said, ` Mom, there's somebody missing.''' Bashful, <PERSON> Doc </PERSON>, Sneezy, Happy, Sleepy, Dopey and the 400-pound Snow White were untouched. Grumpy was gone. On April 26, a freshly-scrubbed <PERSON> Grumpy </PERSON> returned. The sign dangling from his shoulders said, `` I'm home.'' An accompanying envelope contained 35 photographs from his journey, many of them with captions on the back. Grumpy's travels included visits to <LOCATION> Yankee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. There were snapshots of Grumpy ogling bikini-clad women from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> sand dune, Grumpy standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, Grumpy dining at a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant. `` My husband and I, we were laughing so hard at these pictures, my husband was late for work,'' <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said. She said neither she nor the police know who took Grumpy. She theorizes that `` it's someone with an engineering background. The printing on the back of the pictures is very similar to the type you see on blueprints.'' <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said <PERSON> Grumpy </PERSON> had vanished before, turning up once in front of a local Dairy Queen and in the back seat of a restaurant manager's car. `` She saw somebody looking over her shoulder and started screaming. He was just standing there with his arms folded and that snarl on his face,'' <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said. But alas, all good things must end. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> said she plans to have all the dwarfs cemented in place. Nevertheless, she admits to envying Grumpy's wandering ways. `` He gets to go everywhere. I never get to go anywhere.''

 The battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, on which 47 sailors died last month in a gun turret explosion, will proceed with its next regular deployment this summer without undergoing repairs, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. But a decision has been made to fix the damage after it returns, a spokesman added. The service, in a brief statement, said the battleship will be departing in June on a scheduled deployment to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> along with a number of other warships. `` The ship is fully operational except for the No. 2 gun turret, and had already been scheduled to go to the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Naval Shipyard for post-deployment repairs'' after returning from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. Since it will take several months to obtain all the necessary repair parts, `` turret No. 2 will not be repaired prior to deployment.'' `` But it is now the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s intention to repair the turret,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudla </PERSON>, a spokesman. `` The engineering survey team indicates the damage to the ship was contained in turret No. 2, and all other systems on the ship _ including the engineering plant _ are in excellent condition and fully capable of supporting the upcoming deployment,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> concluded. `` The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> remains one of the most powerful and durable ships afloat.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced last week the damage to the huge battleship could be repaired for an estimated $ 15 million to $ 20 million. At the time, however, officials declined to say with certainty the turret would be fixed and if so, when. There had been some doubt about repairs because of the vessel's age The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was commissioned in 1943 during World War II and no vessel of its type has been built since that war. Forty-seven sailors died on April 19 inside the No. 2 gun turret while loading a 16-inch gun with powder. The huge battleship still has two other turrets, each with three 16-inch guns.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed Thursday to cooperate in pollution emergencies in northern waters, like the oil spill that has fouled <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s coastline. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> signed the accord on the last day of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s two-day visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It pledges superpower cooperation in combating spills of oil and other pollutants in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chukchi </LOCATION> seas between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. The news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the agreement provides for the development of a `` joint plan of drastic measures'' by the superpowers in the event of a spill. Each country is required to notify the other immediately of a pollution emergency, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials will hold joint exercises on how to fight ocean pollution, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The signing of the agreement is a major step toward developing Soviet-American cooperation in dealing with the consequences of ecological disaster at sea,'' <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalimonov </PERSON>, an official in the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Khalimonov </PERSON> was quoted as saying the cooperation `` will allow specialists to define within hours the scope of an accident, map out joint measures to overcome its consequences and get down immediately to their implementation.

A Soviet ship designed to skim the surface of the sea was hired to help clean up the oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez tanker, which ran aground in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> on March 24. But Exxon officials, who were paying the Soviets $ 15,000 a day for the aid furnished by the Vaidagubsky, said Tuesday the ship was being sent home because it was not designed to handle the hardened, taffy-like mass the spilled oil has created.

<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, overturning a $ 2 million jury verdict, ruled Thursday that the reprinting of a newspaper article was not libelous even though the article was no longer true when it was republished. The 1972 article by syndicated columnist <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, which reported that the president of a labor union was under federal investigation, was distributed by a rival union during a 1975-1976 battle over which union would represent state workers in <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, was under investigation for alleged mob ties when <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s story originally was published, the investigation ended a few months later with no charges brought against <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>. The jury concluded that <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 94 of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> had libeled <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> and NAGE by reprinting <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s article without showing that <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> since had been cleared. The jury assessed $ 2 million in compensatory and punitive damages against the council and the parent union. Chief Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, who wrote the high court's unanimous opinion, noted that both reprints included the date of the original article in type `` larger than the text print. `` Aside from the fact that the original article was dated and accurate, the text referred to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> wrote. `` The majority of the original column was devoted to a discussion of the upcoming 1972 presidential election between <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>. `` These historical references indicate that the reprints referred to prior events and not to matters occurring in 1975 and 1976,'' <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> wrote. The fact that the reprints were published during a `` heated labor-election campaign -LRB- when -RRB- the important constitutional concerns regarding free speech are greatest'' also weighed in the court's finding that they were not libelous, <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> wrote. It was the second time the case had been before the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In 1986, after the original jury had rejected <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>' lawsuit, the justices overturned that verdict and ordered a new trial <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>' lawyer, said he was puzzled by the apparently contradictory opinions. He said he had not decided whether to seek review in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanzler </PERSON>, the attorney representing the <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION> union, said he believed the court overturned the first jury verdict because the trial judge died in middle of the case. `` Frankly, the case should never have gone to the jury because it was determined those articles were true as circulated,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A jury convicted an ex-police officer of voluntary manslaughter Thursday in the shooting death of his estranged wife, a district judge, in her judicial chambers. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> also was convicted of two counts of assault with intent to murder and one count of felonious assault, resulting from a shootout with fellow officers as Judge <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Irons </PERSON> stumbled from her office on Oct. 19, 1988. The 12-member District Court jury, which began deliberations Wednesday afternoon, also found him guilty of felony use of a firearm. Judge <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolenda </PERSON> said sentencing would be in three to four weeks. <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruel </PERSON>, argued that his 53-year-old client was very drunk and under such severe stress from his impending divorce he did not have the mental capacity to premeditate the killing. `` The only real choices in this case'' are a manslaughter conviction or acquittal, Gruel had said. `` We're obviously pleased with the verdict,'' Gruel said afterward. `` It was obvious the jury felt stronger about shooting the police officers than shooting his wife.'' <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON>, a 21-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapids </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> who originally was charged with murder in <PERSON> Irons </PERSON>' death, showed little emotion when the verdict was read. The manslaughter conviction carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison; the assault with intent charges, up to life imprisonment; felonious assault, four years, and the firearms charge, a mandatory two-year term. Prosecutor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumer </PERSON> said he was both gratified and surprised by the verdicts. `` We're gratified that they -LRB- the jury -RRB- realized how serious the attack on the police officers was _ it was an understandable verdict,'' he said. `` The jury did the job they were called on to do.'' <PERSON> Blumer </PERSON> characterized <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> in closing arguments Wednesday as a `` predatory animal'' who stalked his wife before killing her. Gruel had contended <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> was upset because he had just found out that <PERSON> Irons </PERSON> would not abide by the divorce settlement he believed they had agreed upon. He also was upset by her alleged affair with an old boyfriend, <PERSON> Gruel </PERSON> said. Gruel had testified that something snapped in <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON>'s mind when <PERSON> Irons </PERSON> picked up her telephone and told a police dispatcher across the lobby that <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> was holding a gun to her head. After she was shot, <PERSON> Irons </PERSON> ran out into the hallway, clutching her bleeding throat and <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON> followed her, firing another shot, police said. Toxicologists have testified <PERSON> Ratliff </PERSON>'s blood-alcohol level at the time of the shooting was about 0.25 percent, more than twice the legal limit for intoxication in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.

 Mob boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> `` Little Nicky'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> was sentenced Thursday to a maximum 55 years in federal prison and fined $ 500,000 in a racketeering conspiracy that included 13 murders and attempted killings. He was described by the government as `` a remorseless and profoundly evil man.'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, 59, and 16 other members of his Philadelphia-southern <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> gang were convicted last November. The government said <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> ran the mob from his home in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and was `` the leader of one of the most important and powerful'' of 24 <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nostra </ORGANIZATION> families in the country. As a member of the Mafia's national commission, he `` became one of the most powerful criminals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' Prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritchey </PERSON> said in court. `` The end of this mob family has n't happened yet, but it is severely crippled,'' he said. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> stood impassively, declining to address the court, and merely shrugged his shoulders when the sentence was handed down. Afterward, his lawyer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON>, told a reporter: `` Nicky does n't blame, or have ill will, toward the judge or the proscution because what else were they to do with the false information they got. His beef is against those who lied about him in the courtroom,'' referring to mobsters who turned government informants. Earlier in the day, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Antwerpen </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s nephew, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonetti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Margate </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who was identified as mob underboss, to the maximum 45 years. The judge rejected a plea for probation after noting <PERSON> Leonetti </PERSON> was involved in four murders, an attempted murder and 15 extortions. For the other defendants, sentences ranged from 3 -LCB- years to 45 years. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> was found guilty of participating in eight murders, four attempted murders, 17 extortions and two drug deals plus bookmaking and loansharking. He was not accused in a ninth murder. The judge directed that <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> serve his racketeering sentence after he completes a 14-year federal term he's now serving in a $ 1 million extortion attempt and a life sentence imposed by a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> judge last month in a murder case. `` He should never again be free to prey upon society,'' <PERSON> Fritchey </PERSON> urged the judge before sentencing.

 More than 150 lawmakers urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday to begin negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on the phase-out of nuclear weapons tests as part of a treaty banning the process by 1995. `` A test ban would prevent the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from developing new types of nuclear warheads or bombs that might threaten our future security, such as so-called ` third generation' nuclear weapons,'' the 142 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and 23 senators said in a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has not yet indicated where it stands on nuclear testing, although it is expected to continue the policy of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which opposed additional testing limits. The lawmakers said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has an opportunity to act and a ban `` would significantly advance our nation's longstanding interest in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries. They noted that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty comes up for renewal in 1995. Among the recommendations included in the three-page letter was allowing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a limited period of time to conduct an agreed number of tests to check their arsenals, progressively lower both the permitted size and number of nuclear tests to limit testing of new types of nuclear warheads or bombs and install a network of seismic monitoring stations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to verify compliance with the limits. The final recommendation is a call for negotiating a formal U.S.-Soviet comprehensive test ban treaty that could be signed by all nations and will take effect from 1995 to 2000.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Stay Texas House Knuckled Under to Chemical Lobby</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who voted to water down the agriculture commissioner's power to regulate pesticides knuckled under to chemical industry lobbyists, environmentalists and others charged Thursday. Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>'s aggressive enforcement of pesticide rules has angered some chemical and farm interests, environmentalists said. The commissioner is elected in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, not appointed. `` This ... is a slap in the face to all those ordinary people who ca n't afford high-priced lobbyists,'' said <PERSON> Brigid </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Clean Water Action. `` When you look at this ... ask yourself this question: Would the chemical lobby hire a cadre of people, spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and almost two years' time to pass a bill to better protect the public, or to better protect their profits?'' she said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, disputed the charge and said environmentalists had rejected offers to compromise on pesticide regulation. `` We have, since last fall, offered to negotiate a way to regulate pesticides that would be in the interests of the people of this state and the future. Because they refused to negotiate, because they indicated to me they had commitments that would not allow them to negotiate, we did not get involved. We were not involved in what happened in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gave final approval Thursday to `` sunset'' legislation that would continue the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for 12 more years. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also added an amendment Wednesday to take pesticide regulation away from <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> and give it to a six-member board that would include the commissioner and five others. The bill was sent back to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for consideration of House amendments. If rejected there, the issue would go to a conference committee with members from both chambers. <PERSON> DeDe </PERSON> <PERSON> Armentrout </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said controversy over Democrat <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> _ whose department Republican Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> could abolish by vetoing the sunset review bill _ was hurting the public. `` Eighty-eight legislators placed higher importance on placating a big-monied chemical lobby and an uncaring governor at the end of his career than in protecting citizens against exposure to dangerous pesticides,'' Ms. <PERSON> Armentrout </PERSON> said. The proposed pesticide board would also include the state chemist, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> agriculture school dean, the dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> epidemiology official and a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> official.

<HEAD>News Executives Charged with Computer Hacking</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A prosecutor pursuing a case against two former television news executives charged with tapping into the computer of a competing station says such a crime is similar to burglary. Former WTSP-Channel 10 news director <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, assistant news director at the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> affiliate, were charged Wednesday with 17 counts of computer hacking and conspiracy in the theft of information through computer phone lines. They were scheduled for a May 19 court appearance. `` It's no different than digging a tunnel under their office and coming up and rummaging through their desks,'' Chief Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said. `` It's high-tech burglary.'' If convicted, each could get up to 85 years in prison. They are accused of raiding the files of WTVT-Channel 13, a CBS affiliate between November 1988 and January. Before joining <ORGANIZATION> WTSP </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> was an assignment manager at <ORGANIZATION> WTVT </ORGANIZATION> and helped set up security for that station's newsroom computer, including passwords and identification codes intended to keep files confidential. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, 33, was arrested in February. Cole, 32, his boss, was arrested in April. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Barresi </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> WTSP </ORGANIZATION>, said his station has never condoned hacking and that <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> and Cole were fired. <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> nevertheless said he is considering a civil lawsuit to seize the station's assets under <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s racketeering laws, which let an organization be penalized for profiting from criminal activity. `` Hopefully that would not be the case,'' <ORGANIZATION> WTSP </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. `` The station continues to cooperate. It's in Mr. <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>'s hands.'' <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said his decision on a racketeering lawsuit will be affected by whether <ORGANIZATION> WTVT </ORGANIZATION> sues <ORGANIZATION> WTSP </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're the victims in this case and we're waiting to see what they do,'' <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> WTVT </ORGANIZATION> news director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said corporate executives were still discussing that decision with attorneys.

 The investigation by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> into a federal low-income housing renovation program came under fire Thursday on Capitol Hill from legislators who questioned the conclusions that there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was also criticized for waiting until a day before former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was scheduled to leave the department to interview him and for singling out for culpability <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, the former assistant secretary for housing who was responsible for administration of the program. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> housing about their roles in the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Section 8 Moderate Rehablitation Program and the subsequent investigation of its selection and allocation process. Two weeks ago, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the current <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary, suspended more than $ 100 million in fiscal 1989 spending for project under the program. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' investigation had uncovered a system that `` was undocumented, ignored existing standards and regulations, and was based on the perception and reality of favoritism and abuse of non-public information'' through which former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> appointees and other former government officials won lucrative consultanting contracts. `` Why would you have waited ... until Jan 19 of this year to interview the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> who was going out of office the next day?'' queried Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the subcommittee's chairman, noting that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' probe had begun almost a year earlir. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said his investigation did not immediately turn up any evidence of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s possible involvement and he said `` it was just a matter of scheduling interviews.'' But <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> insisted, as he had another hearing earlier this week, that problems existed in the program before he gained his post in October 1986 and spending decisions were `` discretionary'' for Pierce In January 1987, <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said a selection committee was set up that included himself; <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, former executive assistant to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>; and an undersecretary for policy. But <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> conceded <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> had final approval over any recommendations made by the group. The <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's investigation cover activities in the program from January 1984 through November 1988. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> also asked why <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> made no `` specific recommendations regarding possible violations of law'' by former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> answered that his office had consulted with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> throughout the investigation and found no evidence laws had been violated. `` I find a disturbing indication in the documents that because these allocation formulas and the laws that pertain to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> are not criminal statutes, that the conspiracies that go on here of individuals working together in order to go around established procedures are treated as if they are not criminal matters,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing the report, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> added. Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass described <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> as `` one of the few people that we could ever talk to at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'' during the previous administration. But <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> later took <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> to task because of his hesitancy to name <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official directly responsible for the alleged abuse and mismanagement in the program and he said the inspector general's conclusions might `` compromise'' any future investigation. Rep. <PERSON> Marci </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaptur </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, indicated she might request a special prosecutor to investigate the program.

But some legislators said there is strong pressure on the president _ which he has so far rejected _ to either invade <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or scrap the treaties turning the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the end of the century. They rallied behind the course <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did choose, reinforcing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with an additional 2,000 combat troops and moving to protect the 51,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> civilians in the country. Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> acknowleged that many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not go far enough and tougher action is needed to drive <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power. But he hinted that tougher military steps may be needed depending on the flow of events in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s future options are quite limited. `` It gets a little tighter from here on if nothing happens'' and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> refuses to go, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., said the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> may be on the verge of settling the dispute on their own But he also declared the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the right to `` to keep all further military options opening for response to potential crises.'' `` We're drawing a much tighter noose around <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s neck with every one of these unified actions,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. In a joint statement, the bipartisan leadership of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> expressed strong support `` for the president's action today in taking measured and deliberate steps to assist the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people in restoring democracy to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' The congressional leaders also urged the democratic governments of the hemisphere to condemn <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s actions in `` the strongest possible terms.'' `` It is the responsibility of freedom loving men and women throughout the world to speak out in support of the expressed democratic aspirations of the beseiged people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. It was signed by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash.; <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and At a news conference, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the president had taken a `` prudent defensive measure.'' But he said he had told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> there will be those `` who think this does not go far enough.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the measures have a dual purpose: protect American lives and `` put the heat on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' `` We would hope that the Panamanian people and international concern and outrage would have an impact on Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy Democratic leader, said there is `` general support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the steps the president has taken. He said that at a meeting with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` rejected advice to invade <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or to break the treaty with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' Although <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> did not say who gave that advice, those courses of action have been urged by several lawmakers. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said that although there is no guarantee <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s moves will force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure quickly, especially in light of the staying power he has shown to date, `` they should reduce the prospects that he will stay there a long, long time.'' Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, questioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to withdraw <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` It is precisely when relations are at their worst that we need an ambassador in country,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said. `` In this situation, the continued presence of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador could provide important encouragement to the Panamanian opposition.'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said he supported the decision to withdraw dependents, maintain sanctions and `` assert our treaty rights regarding the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>.'' He warned, `` There is a risk, of course, that increasing our troop strength could provide a convenient pretext for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to renew his accusations that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is planning military intervention and to use that charge to take further repressive actions.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for narcotics trafficking and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., said the prospect the indictment might be withdrawn should figure in any negotiations to persuade <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave `` I think that in order to get this guy out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ... that should be a part of the negotiations,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said. He said the situation is made tougher by the fact that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has made clear `` that his goon squads are perfectly willing to beat, maim and kill people.'' Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s president pro tem, saying he found the conduct of the Panamanian presidential elections `` saddening and maddening,'' said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should now embark on a diplomatic offensive throughout <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` to isolate <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from the fruits of international economic, political and diplomatic intercourse in this hemisphere Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has every right to protect its people and protect its property.'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action has `` got to give'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> more pause. `` He will sleep less well tonight,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. But Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said `` I'm not sure Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will sleep at all tonight. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said that in the past the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has underestimated <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but the Panamanian leader `` senses the tide turning.'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said that for the `` first time an entire, united, bipartisan consensus policy has emerged.'' `` The most important thing is that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is reaching out to Latin American allies. That's never happened before.'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said he currently opposes dropping the drug charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but said he would n't rule that out. `` If assets are given up, other things are achieved which balance against it, I would n't negate any plea-bargaining,'' he said. `` I have a problem with it, but I hope we do n't get to that. Let's see what the ingredients are at that time.'' Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., said he commended the president for his action because he believes there was a `` tremendous degree of pressure on the president to take actions that were more strident.

<HEAD>Kenya Urges Ban on Ivory Trade To Save Elephants From Poachers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> on Thursday urged an international ban on the trade of ivory in an attempt to curb the illegal slaughter of elephants, which has halved <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s elephant population since the early 1970s. Experts say a dramatic increase in elephant poaching has been spurred by record world prices for ivory. Ivory sells for about $ 91 a pound, and an average tusk weighs 11 pounds. `` The policing of the elephants' survival is not easy, but it will be more practical if any ivory trade is banned,'' <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngala </PERSON>, minister of tourism and wildlife, said at a news conference. Conservationists believe there are about 750,000 elephants left on the continent. They say poachers are killing about 75,000 of the mammals a year. If the slaughter continues at that rate, the population could be wiped out by the year 2000. An aerial survey last year found an estimated 20,000 elephants in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, which 15 years ago had an elephant population of 121,000. <PERSON> Ngala </PERSON> said the government will conduct another count in June and July. He said <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> submitted its recommendation on a trade ban Thursday to the <LOCATION> Lausanne </LOCATION>, Switzerland-based Convention In Trade Of Endangered Species. If two-thirds of the convention's approximately 100 members vote to list elephants on the convention's Appendix One at the group's next meeting in October, international trade in elephant products would be banned <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s neighbors to the south and east respectively, have submitted similar proposals to the convention, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s director of wildlife. However, countries such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a major ivory consumer, are likely to oppose the proposal. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, one of the few African nations with a growing elephant population, has annual elephant kills and a thriving legal trade in elephant products. In the last 12 months it has earned about $ 600,000 in legal ivory sales. <PERSON> Ngala </PERSON> said that while <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> realizes some African countries would suffer from an ivory trade ban, such action is crucial if the elephant is to survive. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> also plans to fence parts of its wildlife parks to better protect elephants, <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> said. Since the beginning of the year, he said, as many as 300 elephants have been killed in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s parks.

 A fire that gutted a breeding center housing about 500,000 laboratory mice will cause a worldwide disruption of laboratories researching AIDS, cancer and other diseases, officials said Thursday. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Paigen </PERSON>, the incoming director of <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, pledged `` to get back up as fast as we possibly can'' as salvage teams searched for living mice within the research center's still-smoldering animal production facility The laboratory, which distributes about 2 million mice annually to researchers, is the world's leading non-profit supplier and developer of mutant mice bred in hundreds of genetically identical strains. About a half-million mice would be in the facility on any given day, officials said, but there was no estimate of how many or what types might have survived. <PERSON> Paigen </PERSON> said the center had saved its `` foundation stocks'' of specially bred mice but warned that supply disruptions would hamper researchers who need the mice to investigate cancer, AIDS and other human diseases. `` Thousands of labs, literally all over the world, depend on us for supplies of mice, genetically defined animals,'' <PERSON> Paigen </PERSON> said. `` I think it's safe to say we have some of everything, but how much we have of anything is not clear right now,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Standel </PERSON>, director of animal production. The laboratory, located two miles outside the picturesque resort village of <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, housed about 1,000 strains of mice, many of them rare. `` The impact is going to be terrific, really detrimental,'' said <PERSON> Salome </PERSON> <PERSON> Waelsch </PERSON>, a professor of molecular genetics at the <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There is no way of restoring this facility by just importing mice from elsewhere,'' said <PERSON> Waelsch </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidman </PERSON>, a professor of neuropathology at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and a senior research scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, predicted the fire would `` modify the pace of research'' for up to a year <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Leder </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, described Wednesday's fire at the Bar Harbor complex as `` a tragedy.'' While the lost mice can be replenished eventually, <PERSON> Leder </PERSON> said, `` it's just going to take a tremendous amount of energy, investment and time.'' State Fire Marshal <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisset </PERSON> said the fire was accidental and was apparently linked to `` a product that gave off flammable vapors'' that was being used by renovation workers in the building. One worker suffered extensive burns in the fire and was listed in satisfactory condition Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturgeon </PERSON>. Two other construction workers injured in the fire remained in the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, where they were listed in stable condition. Inside the laboratory's research center, which was not involved in the fire, supervisory staff handled a steady stream of phone calls from <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> customers, explaining that damage assessments had only just begun. `` It's universities, it's hospitals, it's government agencies, pharmaceuticals,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomroy </PERSON>, an assistant manager. <PERSON> Paigen </PERSON>, who assumes the director's post full-time this summer, vowed that the center would recover fully from the fire. `` The major decision we made, in fact we never considered an alternative, is that we're rebuilding,'' he said.

 A motorist accused actor <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottoms </PERSON> of waving a Western-style pistol at him during a freeway clash, and Bottoms was booked on two criminal charges, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>, 38, of <ORGANIZATION> Meiners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oaks </ORGANIZATION>, called the <ORGANIZATION> CHP </ORGANIZATION> on his cellular phone at about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday to report he had been threatened as he drove his pickup truck on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 101 in <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CHP </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Utter </PERSON> said. Traffic officers pulled over the station wagon belonging to `` The Last Picture Show'' actor about 12 miles farther north on the highway, near the <LOCATION> Ventura-Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> line. Bottoms, 37, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> was booked for investigation of brandishing a gun on a roadway, a felony, and carrying a loaded weapon, a misdemeanor. He posted bail and was scheduled for arraignment Monday in Municipal Court. Utter said he had only limited details of the freeway confrontation. `` It would appear he -LRB- Bottoms -RRB- became involved in the freeway incident either due to discourteous or possibly unsafe driving,'' he said. Bottoms' arrest was routine and the gun was confiscated. `` It was apparently a long-barreled, .22 - caliber pistol,'' Utter <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bresler </PERSON>, Bottoms' spokesman, said he would not even call the actor to ask him to comment on the arrest. `` I have trouble believing that's true,'' he said. `` It does n't sound like the Timothy Bottoms I know.'' Bottoms made his film debut in 1971 in the movie `` Johnny Got His Gun,'' the same year he appeared in `` The Last Picture Show.'' His other films include `` The Paper Chase'' -LRB- 1973 -RRB-, `` The Other Side of the Mountain Part II'' -LRB- 1978 -RRB- and `` Invaders From Mars'' -LRB- 1986 -RRB-. Bottoms has also appeared in several television productions including the mini-series `` East of Eden'' in 1981.

 Latin American nations denounced <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for voiding its election, but several said Thursday they opposed foreign interference. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> backed <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s government and said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention would provoke an `` explosive reaction.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was adding 2,000 soldiers to the 10,000 stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to `` protect the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens.'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> recalled its ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for consultations, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> urged Latin American nations to act together to protest vote fraud, and he called the decision to nullify the count `` even worse than the fraud itself.'' <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> said: `` The election in which an entire people voted with such hope, seeking their freedom without violence, has been betrayed.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> joined the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in demanding the resignation of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000 soldiers and police, who has been the country's de facto ruler since 1983. A statement by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> condemned `` the repeated use of force and numerous acts of violence during the electoral process, particularly the brutal physical aggression against opposition leaders by bat-wielding thugs trained by the country's defense forces.'' It hinted at sanctions with the declaration: `` The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, whose relations with the Latin American countries are based on consistent and permanent respect for the principles and institutions of democracy, can not ignore the seriousness of these developments.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said he was in `` constant consultations'' with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other leaders. He said he had called for an extraordinary meeting of the permanent council of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> to consider action against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it would support an emergency meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> to find solutions to the Panamanian crisis. Salvadoran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> also said he would petition <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> to convene an emergency meeting. `` All the <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidents of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> see that there was obvious fraud in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and we must now raise our voices,'' he said. International election observers, including former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> had been leading <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, by a 3-1 count when balloting was voided. In <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, Argentine Foreign Minister <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> said `` what happened in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> seems to us incredible and unacceptable.'' The government of Peruvian President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said it `` denounces and rejects'' the nullification, which it called a `` maneuver against the will of the Panamanian people.'' <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> also said, however, that it supported the fulfillment of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>, under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will turn over the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the year 2000. In <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s government `` views with concern'' the violence and the voiding of the balloting `` We also view with concern a rise in interference by some countries in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s internal affairs,'' the ministry added. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> also said it opposed foreign interference. The statement `` warns about the grave consequences for all of the Latin American region and for the interests of relations between <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -LRB- because -RRB- of the unavoidable and explosive reaction that would take place among the peoples of our <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> if there is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action,'' reported <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rebelde </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. It did not offer details on what the consequences or reaction would be. On Oct. 25, 1983, Cuban construction workers and a handful of soldiers battled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invaders on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> but were overwhelmed as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ousted a radical Grenadian army junta. On Wednesday, seven Latin American foreign ministers said the turbulence following the Sunday election could further isolate the country from the region's democracies. The statement was signed by the Group of Eight nations, which actually has seven members _ <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was suspended after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the nation's de facto ruler, engineered the ouster of elected President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> in February 1988. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> also condemned the voiding of the elections, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> demanded <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> resign. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency contended the nullification was necessary because the opposition, `` directly instigated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' had attempted to rig the results. The decision to nullify the election `` appears to be extraordinary, but the only correct one,'' it said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> account `` very disappointing.'' `` It certainly tends to throw cold water on many of the claims of a new thinking, a new openness in foreign relations,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Amherst Board Upholds Controversial Anthrax Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The town <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> refused Thursday to ban controversial military-funded research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, research that local Quakers fear could be used in germ warfare. The university has been wracked by three weeks of protests by students and <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> residents over Department of Defense-funded research on campus, particularly microbiologist <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>'s work with the anthrax bacteria Campus police have arrested 151 people since the protests began. Early Thursday morning, they removed and arrested a group of students who had barricaded themselves in a campus building for 30 hours. Both the town health board and the <ORGANIZATION> UMass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> held special meetings Thursday to discuss the issue. The faculty agreed to review university policy on campus research, which holds that only non-classified research whose results can be made public may be conducted. The health board, by a 3-0 vote, rejected a call by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> chapter to halt <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>'s research on anthrax, a disease of cattle and sheep that can also be transmitted to humans. The Friends' spokesman, <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Helfand </PERSON>, said the likelihood of a laboratory accident that could spread the disease to the town is slight but possible. <PERSON> Helfand </PERSON> also charged that <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>'s work on improving the vaccine against the disease could be used offensively. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> could inoculate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces against the disease while infecting enemy soldiers. He also charged <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> with working with new and dangerous strains of the bacteria in what could be a violation of the 1972 international treaty banning biological weapons. <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>, in a telephone interview Thursday, said he deliberately chose to work with non-virulent strains of the bacteria and has no reason to develop highly toxic strains of the bacteria, since the military could already purchase them from a commercial laboratory. But, he said, an improved vaccine might protect in peacetime <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers who go to parts of the world such as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where anthrax is endemic. <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> said he has never had a safety problem and believes his work does not have offensive military applications. `` If I did n't feel confident about that, I would n't be doing it,'' he added While recognizing that military-funded research on campus might be undesirable, the health board sided with <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>. `` I do n't think there is any question that the opponents object to the research because of the source of its funding and are using this issue as a means to accomplish their ends,'' said chairman <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, a biology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holyoke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. She said the last anthrax death in a laboratory was 35 years ago. Initially <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>'s work, begun in 1966, was funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. For the past nine years it has been financed by $ 1 million in grants from the Pentagon. About $ 11.6 million of the $ 57 million the 25,000-student university received in grants during 1988 came from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Quakers </ORGANIZATION> said they will appeal the board's decision to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>. They have also placed an article before town meeting that would ban all military-funded research at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>. The town will vote on that question in late May or early June.

 Opposition leaders Thursday rejected the government's move to void the election and said the world should unite to oust Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, whose thugs beat them the day before. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> reinforced. Dependents of military and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> staff members were moved to the safety of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION>. Panamanian soldiers patrolled the city. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel were advised to stay off the streets if possible and to wear only civilian clothes in public. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that about 2,000 soldiers would be added to to the 10,000 stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to `` protect the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens.'' About 21,300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> civilians live in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, many of them retired. There was no immediate reaction from the Panamanian military. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of the 15,000-man <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, has been <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler since 1983. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tried to get him out through a variety of means, including economic sanctions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also recalled <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies doing business in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will be asked to bring home dependents. He said Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would be asked to leave or to move into one of the 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military compounds. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, the opposition's candidate for first vice president, issued an `` urgent call to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments to start a concerted, decisive diplomatic and political action to help make the will of our people prevail and to keep us from sinking deeper into savagery and disaster.'' He said this should be done by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> told a news conference he would not let the government use fraud as an excuse for nullifying the elections when the fraud was committed by the Panamanian military. On the deployment of additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said: `` It is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy provoked by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and not requested by us.'' A government statement Thursday denounced what it said was an attempt to organize a coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> organized in part by Venezeuelan President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. The release said those contacted about taking part included <PERSON> Col </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, the chief of intelligence of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military. There was no immediate response from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reporters were barred from an Elections Tribunal press conference Thursday. On a tape recording of the conference <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulice </PERSON>, head of the tribunal, said she did not know when new elections might be called. `` For now what is more important is peace among Panamanians,'' she said. `` There will be decisisons later.'' Many nations condemned the government's nullification of Sunday's presidential election, which the government said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s candidate won and foreign observers said was a landslide for the opposition <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters with bats and metal pipes beat <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, the opposition presidential candidates, and his running mates for the two vice presidencies during a demonstration Wednesday. Soldiers watched but did not interfere. The beatings occurred after soldiers intervened in the protest of what the opposition calls the theft of Sunday's election. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> remained hospitalized Thursday with a scalp wound that required eight stitches. Doctors said his condition was stable with no neurological complications. `` We won and we will continue to fight,'' said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, a vice presidential candidate who was beaten and thrown in jail. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, who had stitches over his eye and cheek, said he was sentenced Wednesday night to a year in jail for inciting riot and attacking soldiers, then freed a few hours later. He said the opposition wants to talk with the military, but that would require getting rid of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` because <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> can not have two presidents.'' The government said it was voiding the election because irregularities and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference made it impossible to declare a victor. It also cited stealing and buying of votes and missing tally sheets. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said embassy dependents were moved to <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> on Thursday. There are 152 embassy dependents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and 10,560 military dependents, 972 living off base. `` You have these ` Dignity Battallions' moving around town and targeting people,'' Ms. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said. Members of the `` Dignity Battallions,'' armed groups of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters, were involved in the melee Wednesday. Ambassador <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and other officials said one of <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s bodyguards was killed and about 20 demonstrators were injured Wednesday The military said four soldiers were wounded. More than 300 international observers, including former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, supported opposition claims that <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> won by a 3-1 margin. When the election was voided, official results had shown <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s handpicked candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, leading by about 2-1. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> began its campaign to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after he arranged the dismissal of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after the general was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges in February 1988. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies the charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claims the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to get rid of him so it can renege on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, which turn the canal over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Dec. 31, 1999.

 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to evacuate 300 Thai workers from a Libyan plant the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alleges can produce poison gas, it was reported Thursday. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has threatened to bomb the area but has promised it will inform <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> before launching an attack,'' said The Nation, a Thai newspaper.

 A prosecutor said Thursday that four <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> members acted in concert to beat to death the 8-year-old daughter of the disciplinary group's founder. `` They all committed the crime of beating <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> to death,'' <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said in his closing statement. The jury began deliberations Thursday afternoon on the first-degree manslaughter charges against <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON>, 31; <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 38; and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>, 28, all of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Prosecutors have said the girl was struck hundreds of times Oct. 13 as punishment for stealing food, and as an example to other children who were staying in a farmhouse near <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION>, about 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> in the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION>. Witnesses testified she was beaten with an electrical cord, rubber hose, piece of plastic pipe, bamboo pole and weightlifting belt. Most of the 53 other children were forced to watch the beating, prosecutors said. Several testified that <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> was slammed against a wall, kicked, tripped, slapped, dropped on the floor, shoved, bitten, spit upon and hung out a window. After <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON>'s body was delivered to a fire station, the other children, ranging in age from 1 -LCB- months to 16 years, were taken into state custody. The children now are living in foster homes or with relatives. The girl's father, <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> at the time of her death. He did not attend the trial. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, 35, has blamed negative news coverage for his daughter's death. He denied that the children were beaten or abused, saying they were only `` spanked.'' <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> formed Ecclesia at the <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to steer children away from drugs and crime and to motivate them through tough discipline and athletic training. The children were brought to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> last summer while the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> center was being renovated. French said the defendants' effort to discipline <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> turned into a `` contest of wills.'' `` The wills of the four defendants prevailed that night, and <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> is dead,'' French said. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, the attorney for <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>, responded that French's selection of witnesses and evidence, including graphic photographs of the dead girl's body, had been a calculated attempt to misdirect jurors. `` The little children who were paraded before you were done to inflame you and enrage you,'' <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> said French called only a few of the children as witnesses because others would have presented conflicting accounts of what happened to <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, the attorney for <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON>, argued that French failed to prove their clients were guilty of manslaughter. `` You wo n't like it,'' told jurors. `` I do n't ask you to like it. But you've got to follow the law.''

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The woman reputed to be the priestess of a cult blamed for 15 ritual slayings was moved Thursday with six others arrested in the case to a prison on the edge of the city. Officials said the seven, who had been held at the city attorney general's office for questioning, could be arraigned as early as Friday. Although they were sought in connection with the cult killings, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> and the other two main figures in the group have been charged only in three <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> murders. One of those killed was the `` godfather'' of the cult, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, who cult members said ordered his own execution when police closed in on them at a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> apartment on Saturday. Two other women, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> <PERSON> Guero </PERSON>, a physician, were charged with covering up a crime in connection with the 15 killings on the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION> ranch outside <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. Their case was to be transferred to a federal court. In announcing the charges late Wednesday, <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, an official of the city attorney general's office, said Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and three others who were with them in the apartment had made a pact to kill each other if they were going to be arrested. `` This death pact was carried out,'' he said. Authorities said Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, a former honor student at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southmost </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, directed the human sacrifices and other rituals, including mutilations and boiling of brains and organs. They said the rituals were meant to bring occult protection to the drug ring, which allegedly trafficked in marijuana to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, one of those arrested, said that when <PERSON> Costanzo </PERSON> saw police on the street below the fourth-floor apartment where they were staying, he panicked and demanded to be killed. He told a news conference earlier this week that he used a machine gun to kill <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, his right-hand man. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> and <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> were charged with homicide, firing a weapon at authorities, resisting arrest, criminal association and causing injuries. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> was charged with the first four crimes. The death pact was the basis for the homicide charges against Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> and <PERSON> Orea </PERSON>, <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> said. He said another consideration was that when <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> to kill him, Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> urged him on. At a news conference on Sunday Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> said she told <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, `` Do it, do it. If you do n't do it, you're going to pay with circumstances -LRB- you encounter -RRB- in hell.'' <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, a Cuban-born American from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> and other associates had been sought on both sides of the border since April 11, when police dug up the first of 15 bodies found on the ranch. Most of them were mutilated, including that of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, a pre-medical student from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In two news conferences, Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> calmly told reporters she knew nothing of the murders until she saw television reports on the discovery of the bodies and asked <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> about them. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs Agent <PERSON> Oran </PERSON> <PERSON> Neck </PERSON>, speaking in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, told a news conference Wednesday that during questioning she had `` confessed to conspiracy and involvement'' in the killings.

<HEAD>Baby Of Brain-Dead Teen Delivered By C-Section</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A brain-dead teen-ager whose plight became the focus of a right-to-life debate delivered a premature baby by Caesarean section Thursday while on life-support machinery. The baby girl, who weighed about five pounds and was seven weeks premature, was listed in very critical condition Thursday afternoon, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernardino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The baby is suffering breathing difficulty because her lungs are insufficiently developed. The mother, <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, 15, was pronounced brain dead after she was shot in the head two months ago. In March, her divorced parents requested that their pregnant daughter be disconnected from life-support equipment, leading to protests by the Right to <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. The parents later reversed their position. <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> said the mother began having contractions Wednesday afternoon. The doctors tried desperately to halt them with medication, but the fetus' life became threatened. `` On the morning of May 11, the fetus began to demonstrate signs of fetal distress in response to the uterine contractions and the decision was made to perform an emergency Caesarean,'' <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> said. Doctors said the baby girl was suffering from hyaline membrane disease, caused by a deficiency of a bodily chemical that normally coats tiny sacs within the lung, where blood in the membrane absorbs oxygen. Without the chemical, called surficant, the sacs collapse with each breath the baby takes. `` <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> has continued to remain on life-support system pending parents' notification of their wishes,'' <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> was declared brain dead March 15 after she was shot in the head, allegedly by her 16-year-old boyfriend, who police said is believed to be the father of the child. The boyfriend, known by the gang street name `` Stymie,'' is in jail in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in connection with an unrelated murder charge. The juvenile's name has not been released by authorities.

 Those summer days spent soaking up the rays to create a glorious tan may come back to haunt sun worshippers with cancer and aged, wrinkled skin, a panel of experts said. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> consensus committee on Wednesday said current health studies show that suntans can lead to skin cancer, a weakened immune system and skin that wrinkles and ages before its time. Instead of uncovering to bathe in the noontime sun, the panel recommended Americans avoid the midday hours of sunlight, wear shading clothes and apply generous amounts of sunscreen lotions. Children in particular should be protected from overexposure to sunlight because skin damaged early in life is more likely to develop cancer later, the panel said in a report.

 Some doctors are warning that long-term, daily use of a common aspirin substitute may triple the usual risk of kidney damage, but the maker of Tylenol disputed the finding. `` I do n't want people to panic and say, ` My kids should n't have Tylenol,''' said Dr. <PERSON> Saulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Klahr </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` But at the same time, it's important for people not to take this drug daily.'' <PERSON> Klahr </PERSON> said acetaminophen, the main ingredient in Tylenol, Anacin-3, <PERSON> Datril </PERSON> and other brands, may accumulate in the kidneys and cause chemical damage. A related painkiller, called phenacetin, was taken off the market six years ago because of concern about kidney damage and bladder cancer. Some experts also have worried that prolonged daily use of ibuprofen, another common painkiller, may harm the kidneys. The drug was released for non-prescription sales in 1985 and was not included in the study of acetaminophen.

 <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, Land's End and L.L. Bean addicts beware _ the nation's governors want you to begin paying sales taxes on your mail-order shopping sprees. Governors, joined by state legislators and mayors, are urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to overturn a 22-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision and require large mail-order companies to collect sales taxes n sales to out-of-state customers. As a result of that ruling, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday, hometown merchants are at a decided disadvantage and states, cities and counties are losing more than $ 1.5 billion a year in tax revenue. `` Because state sales taxes run from 5 percent to 8 percent of the cost of the goods sold, the unfair tax advantage by out-of-state firms in sales taxes is greater than the average profit margin of Main Street merchants,'' Sinner said. In fact, he added, the average hometown merchant's profit margin is less than 3 percent.

 A man who rented a house to an unmarried couple and then changed his mind because he believed they were not showing respect for Christian values is getting support from across the country. `` I just could n't allow that type of activity to go on in our house,'' said carpenter Layle French, 33, who reneged on an agreement that would have allowed <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenson </PERSON> and her fiance to move into a house he was trying to sell. A <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> administrative law judge ruled in March that French violated a law that prohibits discrimination based on marital status. He said the only unsettled issue is how much French should pay in damages. French, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, contends the law should take a back seat to his Christian values. Aside from that, he maintains that couples who live together violate the state's fornication law.

 The Cabildo, the building where the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION> was signed, stands echoing and vacant, only the 20-foot ceilings and other architectural details hinting at more than 200 years of history. Large chunks of the ceilings and floors are ripped out of one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' most famous landmarks. Where maps and pictures once hung, stenciled instructions order, `` Repair cracks entire wall'' and `` Remove plaster.'' But there are no workers to follow those instructions, or to replace the third story, destroyed by a fire May 11, 1988, because the state has n't come up with $ 1.2 million to get things ready for renovation. Firefighters rescued most of the Cabildo's treasures, including the death mask of <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>. A temporary roof was installed after the fire, but without a third floor to hold the building together the mortar between the massive gray stones of the front wall lost its grip. The wall had been leaning since at least 1850, but daylight now showed through the corners. Crews installing inch-thick rods to tie the front wall to the back discovered a new problem: asbestos, used in renovations years ago. That prompted the state fire marshal to check not only the Cabildo but other nearby museum buildings and order $ 1.2 million in repairs. Insurance covers $ 4 million in fire damage but not the ordered renovations, so State Museum Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sefcik </PERSON> is looking to the state _ at a time when Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> is trying to cut $ 700 million from the state budget. But <PERSON> Sefcik </PERSON> is confident he can get the $ 1.2 million. It's not new money, he said, but funds left over from other State Museum capital projects. `` It does n't add to the burden that the Legislature is facing at all. It's money that is there from the past,'' he said. He is worried, though, about cuts proposed by <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who has said all agencies not protected by the state constitution must slash their budgets by one-quarter. `` Those budget cuts are devastating,'' <PERSON> Sefcik </PERSON> said. `` They'll effectively destroy the State Museum system if they go through the way they've been proposed I do n't want to be the guy who has to lay off 25 people. `` The amount of money involved is n't that big. We're talking about the cultural heritage of this state. It's got to be worth a couple million dollars. `` If it's not, I'm in the wrong business.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Sefcik </PERSON> is asking for $ 2 million in donations to refurbish and improve exhibits in the State Museum buildings near <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. New exhibits, in <PERSON> Sefcik </PERSON>'s plans, include getting someone to develop a video game based on the 1815 Battle of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, which actually occurred after the War of 1812 was officially over. `` The visitors will represent the British and have to attack <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s position as it was at the time of the battle. They will discover what the British were up against and will understand why <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> chose that spot and why the British lost.'' Other planned exhibits include plantations, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s early and colonial history and the Cabildo itself, he said. `` One of the problems we have is that so much history took place in the Cabildo that is germane to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that I wish we had twice as much space, because it all deserves telling.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> was under Spanish rule when the <ORGANIZATION> Casa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabildo </ORGANIZATION>, or town hall, was built in the 1790s on the site of a police station. Fire had destroyed the roof and woodwork of the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garde </ORGANIZATION> in 1788 and 1794, but its heavy brick walls and floor remained and were incorporated into the much larger Cabildo. After 1803, when the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION> doubled the size of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the Cabildo housed the Government of the Territory of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and municipal police station moved in 50 years later. <PERSON> Plessy </PERSON> <PERSON> vs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, the case that established the `` separate but equal'' racial doctrine that stood until 1954, was among the many cases heard there. <PERSON> Sefcik </PERSON> figures it will take about 18 months to develop the exhibits, but the work ca n't start until the money is in hand. He hopes to reopen the Cabildo in the first half of 1991. The combination of publicity about the Cabildo because of the fire and the new exhibits should boost the number of visitors from about 150,000 a year to about 250,000, he said. When all of the Jackson Square complex is open, he figures the number could be a million. `` As tragic as the Cabildo fire was _ and I do n't ever want to go through anything like that again _ I think in many ways it will be looked upon as one of the best things that happened in the history of the State Museum,'' he said. `` It has forced people to take a second look at something they took for granted, to understand that all of these resources are precious, are special, deserve better care than perhaps they had been given.''

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> has gotten out his traveling shoes again. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, apparently well-pleased with its February road trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, is going to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> next week for the summit meeting between <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. `` If this is n't a big story, what is?'' said Rather, who anchored an ambitious week of coverage in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that cost an estimated $ 2 million and involved almost all the news division's broadcasts <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> also sent their anchors and contingents of correspondents to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for the state funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. This time, <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> is sending its <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> anchor, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> will stay in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has announced <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> will go to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> later this month when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> meets with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. For <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> is sending Rather to anchor the `` CBS Evening News'' from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Sunday's `` CBS Sunday Morning'' also will originate from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Rather and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuralt </PERSON> will anchor the coverage. `` CBS This Morning'' and `` 48 Hours'' went to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but will stay put this time. Rather said in a telephone interview that even though fewer programs are going along, the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sojourn rivals the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> road trip in budget and scale because of the added logistical complications of covering sprawling <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Since the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> trip, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has suffered a blow to its prestige, losing `` 60 Minutes'' star <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, and there's certainly a prestige boost in anchoring from an exotic locale when your competitors are back home in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Rather sees the trip, however, in a larger context. `` This kind of thing is a real important part of our future,'' he said. `` I think if you ask yourself the question, which it seems to me gets asked about every hour these days, is there any future for network news? I think the answer is yes. And the next question is, if so, what is it? And I think the answer, or part of it, is keeping a real presence in the worldwide news-gathering business, not just news packaging, but news gathering.'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> will try to improve on the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> trip with more emphasis on `` man-in-the-street'' coverage. That wo n't be as easy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` The Chinese have given us extraordinary access, and they've been as good as their word,'' said Rather `` This was not always true in the past with previous communist regimes there, but I will say that when they've made agreements, up to now they've kept their word, and they have given us what is for them extraordinary access. And it has n't been particularly easy these last weeks with what's been going on there. There have been major student protests in recent weeks calling for more democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Rather pulled out a metaphor from the works of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> novelist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> to describe the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> trip, likening <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> to the character `` Astronaut'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> who would go to a local basketball court, shout, `` Trying one!'' then shoot from 40 feet out. `` We're trying one,'' Rather said

<HEAD>National Trust Goal Urban Renewal, not Urban Removal</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It sounds like a place of musty closets _ quiet, passive and probably pretty dull. That is not at all what <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> has in mind or on his agenda at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> figures that preserving the past does n't require living in it. So as president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, he is lobbyist, cheerleader and traveling salesman for what he sees as an effort to build <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s past into its future. By his reckoning, the preservation movement is the most active and effective force in rebuilding and reviving <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities in 1989. Urban renewal tore down what was there and tried to replace it with something new. `` The movement,'' as <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> calls it, seeks to revive what is there and put it back to use. He maintains that works better because people prefer to live, shop and work in neighborhoods and places they know, in buildings with a flavor of history about them. Rebuilding, with the emphasis on creating housing and facilities for moderate - and low-income Americans, is only part of `` the movement. It sometimes blocks bulldozers, and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> boasts of a leading role in opposing development of a suburban shopping mall on part of the Civil War battlefield at <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, adjacent to the national park that already protects the main site of the battle. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted late last year to buy the land involved. That and such measures as a 1988 law to protect historic shipwrecks, and scores of traditional projects to guard and maintain historic sites fit one image of the preservationists, as a movement pursuing worthy projects that really do n't have much to do with everyday life. But the same people who fought off the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> mall are taking lessons from the people who build and run malls, and applying them to the rescue and revival of shopping districts, many of them shuttered for loss of customers to suburban shopping centers and discount houses. The Main Street project provides advice and in some cases support for projects in 30 states, from rural downtowns to old but reviving business districts in cities like <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Part of the advice is that neighborhood merchants change their old ways and adopt the techniques of the malls such as opening and closing the shops at the same hours, and cooperating on advertising and promotions. The National Trust's programs provide loans and grants that emphasize restoration for more than its own sake, with refurbished buildings providing housing, community centers and commercial space. They do n't add up to a lot of units, but as <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> notes, any dent in the problem helps, especially in the era of the budget crisis. A sampling of buildings that Trust programs have helped preserve: _ A hotel in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>, which now provides housing and a community center for elderly tenants living on low fixed incomes _ An 1874 municipal building in the <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, to be converted into apartments, offices and shops _ A <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> convent, built in 1889, now to become 11 low and moderate income apartments _ A former <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, which is to be rebuilt as low-income housing and a shelter for the homeless The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> has a $ 26 million budget this year, a speck in federal budget terms. Just under a fifth of the money comes from the government, the rest from contributions and the dues of about 220,000 members. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, 48, has headed the national trust for five years, lengthy tenure on the resume of a man who has been a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> lawyer, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> state official, director of the Office of Government Ethics under two presidents, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. He'll need all of his insider's skills as he lobbies to undo limits on the credits a taxpayer can claim for investing in historic rehabilitation or low-income housing. Without the tax incentive, investment in the restoration of historic buildings has plunged by about 60 percent. Putting it back would cost about $ 200 million a year, and that's not likely to be a popular prospect in the current budget crunch

 One of the most influential players in Wall Street's commodity markets has been subpoenaed in the government probe of possible trading abuses, but he said investigators indicated he is n't a target. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tudor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, whose trading firm manages more than $ 500 million in commodity funds, said Wednesday he was cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in its civil investigation of trading practices on four <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> futures exchanges. Another trader, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Effron </PERSON>, has been subpoenaed by a federal grand jury in a criminal investigation headed by <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office into possibly illegal trading practices on the markets, his lawyer said Wednesday. <PERSON> Effron </PERSON> is the first trader to be publicly named as receiving a grand jury subpoena. He reportedly is not a target of the criminal probe. The inquiries are separate from a criminal investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> into allegedly widespread fraudulent trading practices on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest commodity markets. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 34, is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Tudor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which he founded in 1984 and is considered the most prominent among more than 50 traders from whom federal investigators have requested information. The firm also was subpoenaed. The subpoenas, which reportedly were delivered last week, do not imply any wrongdoing. Tudor president <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> issued a statement that <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the firm `` were among the many traders and firms that received civil subpoenas to provide information in connection with a <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> investigation of others.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and Tudor understand that they are not the subject of the investigation,'' he said. <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> would not say whether the government told the firm and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> they were not targets. Market sources, who asked not to be named, also said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was not a target. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> reportedly is seeking information on <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' dealings with <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Effron </PERSON>, two futures traders who have been mentioned as possible targets. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> inspectors one week ago raided <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s offices at the commodity exchanges as part of a federal grand jury criminal investigation His attorneys have denied any wrongdoing. <PERSON> Effron </PERSON>, 29, has been subpoenaed by the federal grand jury and the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, said his lawyer, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. `` In the grand jury probe they've indicated he is not a target,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said, `` and the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> has n't indicated anything.'' Another reported target is <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Semel </PERSON>, who runs a brokerage in gold, silver and other commodities and was fined by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> for an alleged trading scheme with <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> in 1985. <PERSON> Semel </PERSON> has refused to comment or provide the name of his attorney. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, whose firm manages money for 15,000 customers, is a director of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and board member of the <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where he reportedly made most of his money. He also conducts ethics training classes with a former <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> chairman and is highly regarded in the industry. He runs a highly successful publicly offered futures fund, one of what are known as commodity pools, in which a group of futures investors pool funds run by money managers. A person familiar with the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s order of investigation said Wednesday it includes review of possible violations of rules governing commodity pools. Under <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> guidelines, those could include use of customer funds for personal accounts or failing to provide customers with necessary disclosure documents. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> probe also reportedly examines violations that include pre-arranged trading, use of advanced knowledge of customer trades to trade for personal accounts and conducting of trades in order to skirt tax obligations. The government has subpoenaed the <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the Coffee, Sugar and <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> seeking information on brokers. It also has directly subpoenaed at least 26 traders.

<HEAD>District's Problems Described as `Quite Insignificant'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The problems remaining at savings and loans in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and four nearby states are insignificant when compared with the troubles besetting the industry nationwide, a federal regulator reports. `` Our members have a stronger position to work from than some other regions,'' <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION>, said in the bank's annual report. The Des Moines office oversees thrift institutions in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. The report also said that while overall operations were unprofitable last year for the 176 savings and loans in the district, combined outflows of deposits from those institutions fell more than 25 percent from a year earlier and assets climbed to record heights for a third straight year. It said that with most of the district's previously insolvent thrifts in new, more secure hands this year, there was an improved earnings outlook for 1989. The report was distributed as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wrestled with how to finance the $ 50 billion cash infusion for savings and loan rescues proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Unfortunately for our five-state area, the president's plan for resolving the troubles of the nation's thrift industry came after the majority of District Eight insolvencies had been resolved,'' <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> said. `` The remaining problems in the Eighth District look quite insignificant when taken in a national context.'' The <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> district found new owners for 17 insolvent thrifts last year, leaving just eight troubled institutions in the region. Seven of those insolvent thrifts already have been placed under federal conservatorship awaiting completion of congressional action, and the eighth is scheduled for the same attention, said <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Honarmand </PERSON>, a district spokesman. There are four Missouri problem thrifts, two in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> now under the supervision of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. They are <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Sioux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of Cherokee and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estherville </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girardeau </LOCATION> all in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Honarmand </PERSON> said a state-chartered S & amp; L in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, which he would not further identify, would be placed under federal conservatorship later this year. Nationwide, about 350 thrifts are listed as insolvent by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, while another 250 are described as solvent but in need of government help. In 1988, 223 thrifts were closed or rescued across the country. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION> said 80 percent of its member institutions were profitable last year and improved from their performance of a year earlier. But widening losses at the remaining institutions far offset those gains. Overall, thrifts in the <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> district posted a loss of 92 cents for each $ 100 in assets in 1988, close to the national performance of a loss of 94 cents per $ 100. This widely recognized measure of profitability is called return on average assets. For example, 43 thrifts in the district, representing the top 25 percent, posted what the agency called an `` exceptional'' return on average assets of $ 1.10 for each $ 100. That compared with $ 1 in profit for each $ 100 in assets a year earlier. But the bottom quarter had combined losses of $ 4.06 for each $ 100 in assets in 1988, sharply higher than the overall losses of $ 1.40 for each $ 100 in assets for the same group in 1987. The district regulates 82 thrifts in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 45 in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, 32 in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, 12 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and 6 in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> said it appeared that consumer confidence has remained fairly stable in the district. Despite the widespread coverage of the crisis in the thrift industry, deposit outflows from member thrifts in the district fell last year. Withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 1.7 billion overall last year in the district, but that was down from $ 2.3 billion in 1987. And <PERSON> Honarmand </PERSON> said that when accumulated interest earnings were added to the deposits remaining at district thrifts, there was a net increase in deposits of $ 840 million last year. `` Most depositors are loyal to their local institutions and want to continue doing business with them,'' <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> said. `` The bottom line in the thrift industry is public confidence.''

<HEAD>Bidder Gets Extension for Eastern Offer; America West Ups Shuttle

<TEXT>
 A federal bankruptcy court extended its bidding deadline for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for at least one potential suitor, while a bidder for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s lucrative <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle raised its offer and another airline offered to buy other assets. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> extended Wednesday's 5 p.m. EDT bidding deadline for an investor group led by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader, to give it more time to receive financial information from strikebound Eastern. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay a total of $ 751 million for the <LOCATION> Boston-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Washington </LOCATION> shuttle and 10 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 airliners, raising by $ 25 million the cash portion of its initial $ 726 million bid. That price also would top a rival $ 365 million offer that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has accepted from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for the shuttle. In another development, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> rival <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 525 million for certain <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets, including 15 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757s and related equipment, ground facilities, airport landing slots and three U.S.-Canadian routes. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> said its offer was for spare engines, flight training simulators and other hardware related to the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757s; <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance hangars in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; airport gates in 10 cities already served by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> unit; and U.S.-Canadian routes between <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been under Chapter 11 protection from creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike supported by pilots and flight attendants that virtually grounded the airline. The bankruptcy court must approve any sale of Eastern or any of its businesses, such as the Northeast shuttle. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has pushed for a sale as a means for returning the carrier to full operations as soon as possible. Eastern insists the airline is not for sale and is proceeding with a plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and raise $ 1.8 billion by selling aircraft and other assets. The deal to sell the shuttle and its 21 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 jetliners to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> still awaits the court's approval. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> scheduled a Monday hearing on that deal. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, a regional carrier based in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, last week submitted a $ 726 million offer for the shuttle and 10 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 jetliners. Under its revised offer, <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> stated it would pay $ 415 million cash for the shuttle assets with the balance paid in cash and assumption of obligations on the 10 airliners. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said in a phone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that although the airline had a deal with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, `` ... we also have a responsibility to evaluate other proposals'' and would review the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> offer. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>, president of the Trump Shuttle, said the latest <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> offer did not affect <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s position. `` We have a deal with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>. `` We have a blank check sitting here waiting to be filled in.'' Billionaire hotel executive <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> already has proposed buying all of Eastern for around $ 500 million, although he had not previously submitted a formal offer, according to sources close to the situation. An investor group led by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, also has expressed interest in making a buyout proposal. The chairman of the committee representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s major creditors confirmed Wednesday that bids were expected from the <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> groups. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said neither consortium has detailed its financing plans to the creditors. Neither <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> nor the Howard group would confirm whether they had made firm proposals to the bankruptcy court by Wednesday. Another potential buyer who previously expressed interest, takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, had backed off a bit on Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, stated it needed more time to discuss with its unions the feasibility of integrating the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workforces and was not prepared to submit a formal bid for Eastern at this time. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has held discussions with officials of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions. Last Friday, he informed the court of his interest in buying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> airport hub. Former baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, whose $ 464 million deal to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> collapsed in mid-April, was still interested in acquiring the airline, sources close to <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said Wednesday. However, it was unclear whether he would come forth with a firm new buyout plan, the sources said. Following a recommendation by bankruptcy examiner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> decided that any bids submitted after Wednesday's deadline would be disqualified except `` for good cause shown. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> granted the two-day extension to <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>'s group because confidential <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> financial data sought by the group was accidentally sent to the wrong person, according to <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s lead bankruptcy attorney. <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> CRT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a futures and options trading company based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. It was not immediately clear under what conditions <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> would accept late bids by others. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> and the principals of the bidding groups did not return phone calls Wednesday seeking comment.

 The second attempt to turn <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best-known house of ill repute into the country's first publicly-owned bordello has stalled after the stock offering fell $ 5 million short of its goal <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Walloga </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wallstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is underwriting the sale, said Wednesday his company had negotiated an extension of the sale of stock in the Mustang Ranch until Oct. 31 to allow time to restructure the offer. In the meantime, the sale of common stock in <LOCATION> Mustang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has been halted and all the money received for the shares so far will be returned to investors, <PERSON> Walloga </PERSON> said in a statement released by his office in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` The rules of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ... require that we make this move,'' he said. <PERSON> Walloga </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wallstreet </ORGANIZATION>, was out of the office Wednesday and unavailable for comment. Wednesday was the deadline for the three-month-old bid to take the <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> public through a $ 23.3 million stock offering at $ 20 a share. <PERSON> Walloga </PERSON> said last week about 75 percent of the 1.165 million shares had been sold, leaving the company with a $ 5 million shortfall. <PERSON> Walloga </PERSON>'s statement said an amendment would be filed with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the states that have approved sale of the stock to reflect the terms of the new deal, which <PERSON> Walloga </PERSON> said would change the types of securities <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> would offer. `` No details of the newly structured offering could be released at this time pending a response from the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to a request for an interpretive ruling concerning a technical issue which arose in developing the amendment to the offering,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> attorney and vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said in the statement he expected the amendment to the registration to be filed with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> by June 15. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> would not comment specifically on the offer, citing <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> rules which forbid parties in a stock offering to discuss them. <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is an investors' group composed primarily of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> businessmen and attorneys who are making a second attempt to turn the brothel public. A 1985 bid by <ORGANIZATION> Strong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, fell through after failing to generate enough interest in the $ 18 million proposal. The money raised in the current sale was to have provided $ 13 million to buy the 102-room brothel and its 440 acres of land from <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Conforte </PERSON>, $ 5 million in exchange for the Confortes' promise not to set up a competing brothel and $ 5.3 million for expansion, improvements and working capital <PERSON> Conforte </PERSON> has been trying to sell the brothel 10 miles east of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> since 1985 when he was released from prison after serving 18 months on a tax conviction. He has said he expects most of the money from the sale to go to the federal government in payment of his long-standing tax debt plus the hefty interest and penalties it has run up.

<HEAD>Entrepreneur's Idea For Gym Gear Odor-Cutter Brings Quick Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE WHEELAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The stinky inspiration for Sneaker Balls came to entrepreneur <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> two years ago after his wife complained about an aroma in his car. `` She said she borrowed my car and it sure smelled bad. She said it was the gym bag in the back seat,'' said <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, an athletic 45-year-old who plays basketball regularly. `` It just hit me all of a sudden _ there's a product there. Not something to freshen the car, but to freshen the bag so it would n't smell the car up,'' he said That brainstorm spawned Sneaker Balls _ fragrance discs encased in colorful pingpong-size balls made of recycled plastic soft drink bottles. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s invention is designed to cut the odor of moldy gym bags, rancid tennis shoes and sweaty lockers for up to three months. Each Sneaker Ball exudes a fragrance and an odor-blocker, which floods the olfactory receptors of the brain so they can not smell sweat, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> says. The chemicals are released by twisting the balls to open slots cut into the sides. According to their motto, Sneaker Balls have `` The Courage To Go Where The Ugly Stuff Grows.'' It sounds like a funny idea, but since Sneaker Balls hit the market in July 1988, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> Dennis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>, has sold 1.5 million at $ 2.50 to $ 4 apiece. A new Sneaker Ball design will debut later this year, and the back orders already total 5 million. Green's business comes from most of the big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount store chains and athletic footwear retailers and from stores in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. But Green is n't in the factory all day, supervising production _ he's at home, writing fiction. `` I have one philosophy in business, and that is that I want to write books, and if I have employees I ca n't very well do that,'' he said. For that reason, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> has subcontracted the entire Sneaker Balls manufacturing and distribution operation to a <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> company called New Systems Molding. About 50 employees at the New Systems plant work around-the-clock, molding Sneaker Balls and assembling them. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> expects the work force to double within six months. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> is a trained architect who grew bored with his profession and began designing and selling his own line of greeting cards. Within five years, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> and his wife were designing and selling greeting cards across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in 24 other countries. In 1981, they sold the business so Green could write, but the new owners went bankrupt three years later, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s income stopped and he went back to designing and selling cards _ until his wife's complaint gave him the idea for Sneaker Balls <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said it took a year to make a prototype of Sneaker Balls that he could display to potential investors. `` I began doing research. I did n't know anything about fragrances or plastics either,'' he said. `` I made the prototype by stuffing fragrance in cotton balls because I did n't know anything about fragrance discs. I put them in my bag when I worked out. I put them in my shoes when I was n't working out.'' In a locker room one day, someone noticed <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION>'s Sneaker Balls and asked him about them. The man, who was a broker, signed an option agreement with <PERSON> Green </PERSON> that led to a contract with an investor group. But that was a false start _ the investors made the first payment, but not the next two. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> took Sneaker Balls to a trade show and immediately found a distributor who got him a contract with <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Four months later, in July 1988, he began shipping Sneaker Balls to customers Now <PERSON> Green </PERSON> spends his mornings writing fiction, and his afternoons attending to business and playing basketball, a carryover from his days at <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, where he was a starting forward. And, as business booms, he's also finished his first novel: `` Double Bind,'' a psychological thriller about a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> journalist.

<HEAD>Judge Says Continental Can Had Secret Plan To Deny Pension Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD RICHISSIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Employees of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Can </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are entitled to pension benefits they were systematically cheated out of by top company brass, a federal judge has ruled. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> said Wednesday Continental Can developed a secret and sophisticated computer program used nationwide to keep longtime employees from becoming vested in pension programs. An attorney for the workers said the judge's remarks proved the company's actions have been deplorable and said it could lead to individual awards that exceed $ 100,000 each to some workers and total more than $ 500 million. In a sharply-worded opinion against the company, <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> directed <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Can </ORGANIZATION> to begin negotiating settlements with about 2,500 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> workers. `` The plan was shrouded in secrecy and executed company-wide at the specific direction of the highest levels of corporate management,'' <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> said in a written opinion. `` It was intended to save hundreds of millions of dollars in unfunded pension liabilities,'' he continued. `` The evidence of the plan, its secrecy and its execution comes from the files of the defendants themselves. The documents are more than a smoking gun; they are a fusillade.'' The case <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> heard specifically covered 315 layoffs at a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> plant, and 43 of the company's other 45 plants conceivably could have had their cases heard individually. A suit on behalf of a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> plant was won by the employees; a suit filed on behalf of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> employees is still in litigation. But <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> said in his ruling that there was no need to hear the other cases against <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` What the judge has said is that this should end all the cases everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, an attorney for the workers. `` This is not a case of a class-action suit where plaintiffs each have a claim to $ 10,'' he continued. `` What we're talking here is, you have many former employees who have individual claims worth in excess of $ 100,000.'' Attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eakeley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who represented <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Can </ORGANIZATION>, did not immediately return phone messages. A secretary in his office said she would leave a message for <PERSON> Eakeley </PERSON> and two associates working on the case. The benefits in question were special `` magic number'' pensions negotiated in 1977 by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> for employees subject to periodic layoffs. They were designed to protect employees with long years of service who had not yet reached normal retirement age. But attorneys for the workers have maintained, and the judge agreed, that <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> management adopted a secret computerized plan to prevent employees from vesting in the costly pensions by laying them off before they became eligible. The federal pension law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, prohibits employers from taking any action against workers for the purpose of interfering with their pensions. `` For a corporation of this magnitude to engage in a complex, secret and deliberate scheme to deny its workers bargained-for pension benefits raises questions of corporate morality, ethics and decency which far transcend the factual and legal issues posed by this matter,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>'s ruling should persuade the company not to drag the suit on, but that he was n't counting on it. `` Continental's continued efforts to avoid its obligations to those employees any way it can are deplorable,'' he said. Company attorneys had argued there was no secret plan in place, and that even if there were, the employees would have been laid off anyway. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> rejected that argument. He appointed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Priest </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, to assist the two sides in settling individual claims, and he ordered the money to be paid promptly. `` The class members are entitled to compensation while they are still in a position to enjoy it,'' the judge said. `` They are entitled to the benefits for which they bargained for and for which they worked.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> _ whose art collection includes works by <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> and Impressionists _ is wasting millions of dollars in company funds on `` self-aggrandizing'' plans for a <ORGANIZATION> Hammer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, shareholders charged in two lawsuits The suits, which became public Wednesday in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Chancery Court, seek court orders blocking further <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> spending on the planned museum, requiring return of money already committed and canceling Hammer's employment contract with <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>. `` Defendant Dr. <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> has breached his duty of loyalty to <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> and its stockholders by instigating and forcing <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> to participate in his personal plan of self-aggrandizement in creating his own personal museum,'' one suit says. The 91-year-old Hammer, who carefully cultivates a media image of international philanthropist and unofficial business envoy to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, will fight the allegations as `` totally without merit,'' a company spokesman said. The lawsuits, filed in the state where the oil-and-chemical giant is incorporated, name both <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> and its directors, including Hammer, as defendants. The actions center on a first-quarter expense of $ 36 million to purchase an annuity to fund the planned museum, on rent-free use of company office space for museum purposes and on a corporate commitment to fund construction of a building for the museum at a cost estimated at $ 30 million to $ 50 million. Requests for a Hammer response were referred to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON>, who represents a special committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> board that approved the museum support. <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> directors acted well within the law and in keeping with their duty to the corporation in approving charitable spending that would enhance the company's standing in the community. `` All kinds of companies choose to spread their good will in different ways,'' <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said. `` We choose to spread our good will in a way that will benefit hundreds of thousands of people. To say for one minute that this is not going to benefit <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> is, in my opinion, just ridiculous.'' One suit was filed by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, trustee for the estate of <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adason </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, which holds 700 <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> shares; the other by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>, who describe themselves as <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> shareholders without detailing their holdings. They seek injunctions that, among other things, would bar further <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> support of the museum, including rent-free use of company buildings; cancel compensation to Hammer; and require an accounting of any losses the company incurred in connection with the museum. They also allege that proxy material mailed to shareholders for the company's upcoming annual meeting was misleading about the $ 36 million expenditure for the museum, including it as unallocated corporate expenses. The Sullivan-Brody suit paints a particularly unflattering portrait of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer in detailing a dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> over the future of his personal collection, said to be worth $ 250 million to $ 400 million. The collection includes works by Dutch, Flemish, German and Italian masters; Impressionist works and a codex, or book of notes and drawings by <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON>. Last year, Hammer canceled what the museum portrayed as a promise to donate his art to the county when museum officials rejected conditions including posting a full-length portrait of the industrialist at the entrance to the exhibit. Other conditions unacceptable to the museum, according the suit: That the collection be kept intact forever and displayed under Hammer's name; that names of other museum benefactors be removed from galleries displaying <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>'s art; that the collection get a special curator answerable to a Hammer foundation rather than to the museum. The dispute led to <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>'s plan to build his own museum, the suit says, adding: `` Unlike other wealthy collectors, Dr. <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> does not plan to build ` his own museum' with his own ample funds. Rather, Dr. <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> is requiring <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> to provide substantially all the financial support.'' Company attorney <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> disputed at least part of that, noting the considerable value of the collection Hammer intended to contribute to the project. Hammer, whose 1987 pay was $ 1.9 million, has held sway over <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> since 1957. Based on contacts he made during a post-World War II medical mercy mission in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he served as unofficial envoy for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government during the Cold War. As relations have thawed in recent years, he has led a parade of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, setting up joint ventures for chemical plants and the like. Hammer, who holds a medical degree, has used his connections and company jet to get American doctors to the scene of various disasters, including the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident and the Armenian earthquake.

<TEXT>
 Convicted stock brokerage founder <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> has taken the witness stand for the third time in a federal criminal securities law trial, this time saying he engaged in four unlawful stock deals with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>. Testifying Wednesday at <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>'s securities fraud trial at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who said he spoke on the phone often but only met once with the <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> chairman, detailed their dealings in four stock transactions in 1985 and 1986. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> testified that on four occasions either <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> or <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION>' account executive <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Landy </PERSON> asked him to purchase large blocks of stock either for or from <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> to hide the stock's ownership. Then the prosecutor, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON>, asked <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> if he considered each deal `` lawful or unlawful.'' `` Unlawful,'' <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> said four times. The indictment alleges that <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who founded the Los Angeles-based brokerage house, <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, secretly held stock for <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> in four unsuccessful takeover transactions involving <ORGANIZATION> Cluett </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hammerhill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, H.H. <ORGANIZATION> Robertson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The ruse allegedly was used to help <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> secretly accumulate large stock positions in companies he later would attempt to take over. But on cross examination, defense attorney <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> if he intended `` to commit any crimes in any transactions with Mr. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>?'' `` No,'' replied <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who earlier said he pleaded guilty to two felony counts in a plea bargain with prosecutors. <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, is accused of conspiracy, violating securities and tax laws and making false statements in connection with four failed takeover attempts in 1985 and 1986. If convicted, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> faces a maximum pealty of five years in jail and a $ 250,000 fine on each count. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, 58, turned government informant in 1987 after he was turned in by convicted stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, and has pleaded guilty to two securities-related felonies. He said he faces a maximum 10 years in prison and $ 500,000 in fines although prosecutors are supposed to detail his cooperation to the sentencing judge. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> and his lawyer have said they do n't expect him to serve any prison time. It was the third time <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> has testified for the government in a securities fraud case. He twice took the witness stand in the stock manipulation trial of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its vice chairman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>. Twice that case ended in a mistrial.

 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, credited with uncovering Wall Street's insider trading scandal, says his resignation from the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will not detract from the agency's fraud-fighting effort. `` The enforcement program is a very strong program. ... It's staffed with super professionals ... I do n't think my departure is going to have much of an effect,'' said <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who announced Wednesday that he will leave the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff in mid-July. A lanky, soft-spoken 38-year-old attorney, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in 1976, a year after graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. He became the agency's youngest-ever enforcement director in early 1985. He steps down four years later amid a chorus of praise for playing the central role in breaking open a series of insider trading cases, beginning with the exposure of stockbroker <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, continuing through a $ 100 million settlement with speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and culminating four weeks ago with the settlement of a massive civil fraud case with junk bond-giant <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm. `` He's done extremely well, but the point is the agency will survive,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> enforcement chief, now a federal judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It's a resilient agency and there are no indispensable persons in life,'' said <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON>, the man who hired <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> took over the enforcement division at a time of turmoil for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and is credited with restoring morale damaged when his predecessor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON>, departed amid charges he had beaten his wife. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s attorney and a former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> general counsel, said <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> leaves behind four strong deputies, including Associate Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturc </PERSON>, and all are capable of succeeding him. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement division is incredibly deep in talent,'' he said. Although some securities lawyers say privately that <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> happened to be in the right place at the right time to lead the crusade against Wall Street greed, <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> and others say he was crucial to the effort. `` I think his contribution really can not be overstated,'' <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> said. `` He has given direction and leadership to a program that ... really had not produced anywhere near the results he has now produced.'' <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> is credited with personally piercing the veil of secrecy surrounding the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> branch of a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> bank, where <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> maintained an account. It was three years ago this Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filed its charges against <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, whose cooperation led to <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who in turn implicated <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> in the largest securities fraud case ever brought by the government. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement on the civil case brought by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is paving the way for it to pay a record $ 650 million in fines and restitution to settle criminal charges. Other prominent cases credited to <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> include <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, who paid $ 9 million to settle civil charges, and <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who was forced to resign as head of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> firm he founded. The scandals uncovered during <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>'s tenure forced Wall Street's big brokerage houses to re-evaluate their compliance and ethics codes and led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to increase the penalties for insider trading. As a government employee, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> worked 11-hour days and weekends, earning an annual salary of about $ 72,000, far less than he could earn in private practice. But neither the salary nor the long hours played a major role in his decision to leave, he said. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said he has made no specific plans for his future. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which oversees the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, and a frequent critic of the agency, said, `` He'll be missed He's been a good public servant whose done a superb job of marshaling limited resources.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> `` is losing a strikingly successful public servant,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on finance

 The Drought of'88 is now the Drought of'89 in parts of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, and farmers and stockmen are worried as dry conditions worsen and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fails to provide help this year. `` I guess they have n't decided yet we have a disaster,'' said central <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> wheat farmer <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>. Drought conditions have led experts to predict the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> winter wheat crop will only make around 200 million bushels, 123 million bushels fewer than last year, despite a 22 percent increase in acres seeded. The projected harvest is about half what the crop should have yielded based on the 12.4 million acres planted in the fall. Analysts say that translates into a $ 500 million to $ 800 million loss to the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> economy. Reduced harvests also are expected in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The first official <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimate of the 1989 winter wheat crop was to be released this afternoon. The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> have written repeatedly to Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> seeking help. The groups are asking for several breaks for cattlemen. `` It would be hard to overstate the severity of the current situation and the need for an extremely rapid decision on these requests,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Weibert </PERSON>, president of the livestock association. Because there is n't enough pasture or hay, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> cattlemen are selling off cows they use to produce calves for beef slaughter. Many stockmen have spent years building the genetics in their herds. Many producers and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> farm groups favor extending the provisions of the $ 3.9 billion 1988 drought relief bill to cover 1989 losses. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was asked to take that step by administrative action. He refused, saying it was up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act. Several House measures have been introduced, and a subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled hearings in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> May 19 and 20. `` The'89 drought is simply an extension of the'88 drought. We feel farmers in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> should receive the same consideration for disaster payments in 1989 that corn farmers in the western Corn Belt received in 1988,'' said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahjes </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest farm group, said the $ 250 million to $ 350 million that drought assistance might cost could be covered by the anticipated decrease in federal wheat subsidy payments because of the poor crop `` It could be done without affecting the budget hardly at all because of the deficiency payment reduction,'' <PERSON> Rahjes </PERSON> said. `` We feel it is n't something that would be a burden to taxpayers.'' Farmers enrolled in federal grain programs get deficiency payments to make up the difference between market prices and target prices set by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Since the wheat crop is poor and market prices are up, the subsidy payments are expected to cost far less than expected. To make the federal bailout pill less bitter, the cattlemen have proposed cost-sharing projects instead of outright, direct, federal payments. The livestock association wants a retroactive water project cost-share program and federal help with the costs of transporting cattle to pasture in nearby states. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tice </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>, said farmers are seeking only enough assistance to cover their planting costs so they can keep going another year. He said for many farmers who have struggled back to their financial feet the past two years the drought could be a knockout punch. `` When it comes to keeping farmers in farming and keeping wheat production going in the largest wheat producing state in the nation, I really believe there is no doubt <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is going to come around and come up with a disaster program to help us out,'' <PERSON> Tice </PERSON> said.

 A new requirement by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> making brokerage houses point out contract language that prevents customers from suing offers too little protection, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman says. The commission, by a 5-0 vote Wednesday, approved several rule changes, including one spurred by complaints from unhappy investors who discovered after the October 1987 stock crash that they had signed away their right to sue their brokers. Many firms, in the fine print in paperwork to open an account, require customers to agree in advance to settle any disputes through industry-administered arbitration proceedings, rather than through the courts. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, under the new rule effective in 120 days, will require firms to highlight and fully explain arbitration clauses so investors know what they're signing. The commission decided against an outright ban of the clauses. Some members were reluctant to dictate the terms of contracts entered into by private parties. Also, brokerage firm executives had argued that banning the clauses could destroy the arbitration system and push more cases onto the nation's already crowded court dockets. `` I regret the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> ducked the central issues of choice and voluntariness,'' Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on finance `` Individual investors will still be denied the option in many instances of choosing to go to court instead of arbitration.'' Arbitration, because it is cheaper and faster than suing in court, is a good deal for many investors, particularly those with small claims. But there is only a limited right of appeal and some investors may be better off in court. But <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said enough firms offer cash accounts without arbitration clauses that investors still have access to the market even if they want to keep their right to go to court. However, he warned that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> will be checking to see if more firms start using arbitration clauses. The rules governing arbitration have become increasingly critical following a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in 1987 that upheld the validity of arbitration clauses. Also, the number of arbitration cases has mushroomed from 830 in 1980 to 6,101 last year. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, in adopting the changes, acted on proposals from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think they will make the arbitration process better ... and clear up some of the perception problems that have nagged the system,'' said commission member <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. Another important change requires the exchanges to keep track of the amounts of arbitration awards, the amounts originally sought, the issues in dispute and the brokers and firms involved. `` We now for the first time really will be in a position to effectively monitor the arbitration process,'' said commissioner <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Schapiro </PERSON>. Other changes are aimed at ensuring that the `` public'' members of arbitration panels do not have ties to the securities industry, that arbitrators disclose any ties that may affect their decisions and that arbitrators get more power to compel brokers and plaintiffs to turn over relevant documents in a timely manner.

 <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, Land's End and L.L. Bean addicts beware _ the nation's governors want you to begin paying sales taxes on your mail-order shopping sprees. Governors, joined by state legislators and mayors, are urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to overturn a 22-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision and require large mail-order companies to collect sales taxes n sales to out-of-state customers. As a result of that ruling, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday, hometown merchants are at a decided disadvantage and states, cities and counties are losing more than $ 1.5 billion a year in tax revenue. `` Because state sales taxes run from 5 percent to 8 percent of the cost of the goods sold, the unfair tax advantage by out-of-state firms in sales taxes is greater than the average profit margin of Main Street merchants,'' Sinner said. In fact, he added, the average hometown merchant's profit margin is less than 3 percent. Opponents of the proposal held their own news conference to warn that consumers wo n't put up with it. `` This will have the maximum irritation effect on tens of millions of consumers who would have to do the tax calculations every time they order,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Levering </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, R-Wis., whose state is home to Land's End, added that the bill `` unfairly targets the elderly, the handicapped, farm families and the millions of consumers who rely on mail-order purchases for many of their basic needs Not so, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which chose to emphasize the bill's effect on well-heeled yuppies: `` Many of the goods sold by mail-order firms are expensive, high-quality, designer-type goods that appeal to young urban professionals: pastel sweaters, $ 24 cotton T-shirts, fancy briefcases, electronic gizmos and exercise or recreational equipment,'' the association said in a written statement. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> held in 1967 that a company could not be required to collect sales taxes on purchases from an out-of-state company unless that company had a retail outlet in the state. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>, for example, collect sales taxes on catalog orders because they have retail stores in every state. But Land's End, the giant mail-order clothing company in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, collects no tax on out-of-state shipments because it has no other outlets. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> and other government organizations are supporting a bill to require large companies to collect tax on shipments to any state in which they regularly solicit business. Thus, if Land's End shipped a catalog to <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, that would be interpreted as soliciting and the company would have to collect the state's sales tax on <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> orders. The bill is sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It would apply only to the estimated 5 percent of mail-order outlets whose sales exceed $ 12.5 million a year. But those 5 percent account for 70 percent of mail-order sales. Similar legislation stalled last year, and opponents, led by the <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, are geared up for the renewed battle. `` If this legislation were to pass, direct marketers would be saddled with tax collection duties for over 7,000 municipal and state tax jurisdictions,'' said <PERSON> Levering </PERSON>. `` That means we can be audited by every one of those jurisdictions, even where our companies do n't have physical presence -LRB- in a state -RRB- and do n't receive benefits. Across the Capitol, at the session sponsored by backers of the bill, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said most mail-order customers charge purchases to their credit cards and so would not have to calculate the sales tax.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is failing to notify other countries about dangerous pesticides shipped to them, even though the substances may be used on fruits and vegetables eaten by Americans, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> received repeated warning about such notification more than a decade ago. <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is the biggest market for pesticides, taking 25 percent of world sales, followed by the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, which accounts for 23 percent, according to the report. The fastest growing markets are <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The report quoted the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> as saying about half the pesticides that Latin American countries import are bought from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> furnishes a substantial amount of the fruits and vegetables Americans eat in the winter. `` Not having notices issued could result in continued use in foreign countries of a pesticide that may damage the health of its citizens or damage its environment,'' the report said. `` Additionally, the crops treated with the pesticide could be imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to the detriment of the health of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and the environment.'' The report, dated April 25, was sent to Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>, chairman of the environment subcommittee in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Government Operations. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> looks into activities of the administration on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Copies were made available to reporters this week. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers had canceled the registration of four pesticides after the agency started or threatened to start special reviews because of dangerous effects on humans or laboratory animals. It found that notices were sent to foreign governments on only one of these pesticides, called cyhexatin, saying it could cause birth defects if pregnant women worked in fields where it was used. No notices were sent on the three others _ <ORGANIZATION> EPN </ORGANIZATION>, captafol and and carbon tetrachloride, according to the office, which quoted <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying that they only send notices when they feel there is a health concern. According to the report, <ORGANIZATION> EPN </ORGANIZATION> damages the nerves of laboratory animals, and captafol gives them tumors and is highly toxic to fish. It said carbon tetrachloride may cause damage to people's livers, lungs, kidneys and nervous systems and is regarded by cancer researchers as a probable cause of cancer In April 1978 the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reported that the agency was not making notifications and therefore not complying with the law. It recommended the agency work out a system with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for telling other countries about dangerous pesticides. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> made another report the following year. `` In the decade since we issued these reports, these problems have not been resolved, though <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has told us that it has made attempts to address them,'' the report said. `` Although publicly acknowledging the need for improvements, the pull of conflicting priorities has generally made it difficult for <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to effect these needed changes, according to officials responsible for the notification program.''

 A federal budget that critics say does not do enough to tackle inflation and deficit spending has aggravated fears of economic bust after years of sometimes booming growth. Finance Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is sticking to his view that inflationary pressures can be reduced and that new budget gives the central bank `` the scope to reduce interest rates more quickly than would otherwise be the case.'' However, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>, an Ottawa-based think tank, says in its budget analysis that the risk of recession has grown as a result of the fiscal decisions announced last month. `` We think the economy is going to be very, very soft for the next six months,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, the board's chief economist, told the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and Mail newspaper. Since a second straight majority government of the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was elected in November, Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and other senior officials have led a steady drumbeat calling for a reduction of government debt. Although the 1989-90 budget raises taxes and cuts federal spending in areas from the military to rail service and child care, it still leaves a deficit of $ 25.6 billion _ up slightly from the previous year's $ 25.2 billion deficit. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> says the new budget is the first step in bringing the annual deficit down to $ 12.6 billion in four years. However, achieving that goal may depend on a drop in interest rates, continued economic growth, and tough tax policies. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasic </PERSON> of the Data Resources forecasting firm says <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> missed the chance to make more progress on the budget deficit at the outset of his second term, when election worries are at their lowest. `` It's a major opportunity that was squandered,'' he said. `` We feel that there's about a 40 percent chance of a recession between now and the end of 1990.'' He said, however, that slower growth is more likely. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Jestin </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Scotiabank </ORGANIZATION>, is more optimistic. He predicts growth of 3 percent this year slowing to 2 percent or less in 1990. The Canadian economy has grown, at times dramatically, since the end of the 1982 recession. The gross national product rose beyond inflation by 4 percent in 1987 and 4.5 percent in 1988. Inflation has been running about 4 percent each year, but concern that the economy was overheating prompted <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> governor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> to increase interest rates over the past year to their current 12 percent levels. Forecasts of recession or slowdown have surfaced persistently in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> since the stock market crash of 1987, in large part because of the long expansion.

 Wall Street corruption may provide the windfall the government needs to finance its efforts against illegal drug traffickers, some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that they are weighing a plan that would channel $ 150 million to be collected in fines from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> this year into federal anti-drug initiatives. Under the proposal, the money would be used to pay for prison improvements, additional law officers, grants to state and local governments and other programs during the last months of fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. The appropriations panel would claim the extra spending is not adding to the federal deficit because it would be financed with the unanticipated fines. `` Thus, in my way of thinking, it's an offset for that spending,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, chairman of the Appropriations justice subcommittee, who proposed the idea. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> agreed last December to pay $ 650 million in fines and restitution and plead guilty to six felonies to settle securities fraud charges brought by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The plan is expected to meet opposition from some Democrats and Republicans who likely will argue that with an potential deficit of more than $ 160 billion this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> fine can hardly be considered unaccounted-for money. In addition, some lawmakers have argued that fines collected by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> should be used to strengthen that agency's law enforcement efforts. The proposal is part of an effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to revamp a $ 4.7 billion domestic spending bill for this year, a measure rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last month because ot its high cost. The bill contained money for veterans, college students, anti-drug efforts and other programs. Included in the package was $ 726 million in new spending authority from <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s subcommittee for anti-drug programs, about $ 300 million of which would have actually been spent this year. To make the overall bill more appealing, the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would offset most new spending with cuts in other programs, thus reducing the package's impact on the federal deficit. The Appropriations Committee hopes to bring the new version of the spending bill to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor next week, and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he expects the use of the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> money to be included. `` There is a general approval by the members of the committee of this approach, but there is no concrete agreement,'' he said. The chairmen of the 13 Appropriations subcommittees have agreed to drop from the bill $ 250 million for reparations to Japanese-Americans who were held in internment camps during World War II, and most of $ 153 million that would have been used for the homeless. The final package will be less than $ 4.7 billion, but the total will not be determined until the subcommittee chairmen meet again next Tuesday.

<HEAD>Era of US Irrigation Expansion May Not be Over, Study Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A preliminary study by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the era of irrigation expansion in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may not be over. After irrigated farmland peaked at 50.3 million acres in 1978, there was a gradual downtrend, evidenced by the government's 1982 farm census and by a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> survey. Many experts believed irrigation expansion had run its course. The report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> showed that crop irrigation dropped to 49 million acres in 1982 and then plummeted to 42.3 million acres in 1983 as federal acreage programs and low prices prompted farmers to make sharp cutbacks. Some recovery was reported in several years following 1983, but irrigation still lagged behind the old peak of the late 1970s. Last year, when drought parched crops across much of the nation, irrigation edged up slightly to 45.9 million acres from 44.5 million acres in 1987. `` Irrigated area in 1989 could be the highest since 1982, reflecting strong crop prices, moderate energy prices and low annual acreage set-asides -LRB- reduction programs -RRB-,'' the report said. `` In the East, last year's drought is expected to stimulate some investment in irrigation as a form of insurance.'' In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where most of the nation's irrigation is located, the water supply has improved from a year ago. The report, in the May issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, was written by economists <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinby </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hostetler </PERSON>. `` Crop prices and acreage diversion programs have more influence on irrigated area than do weather conditions or energy prices,'' the report said. `` After expanding about 30 percent per decade -LRB- from 1900 to 1930 -RRB-, irrigation development slow to 4 percent in the 1930s, a period marked by low crop prices.'' When crop prices rose in the 1940s and 1950s, irrigation growth was encouraged once again. The expansion of crop irrigation in the mid-1970s was a `` substantial deviation'' from the pattern, the report said. That was due to favorable crop prices and expanding exports, which helped push irrigation growth to about 2.3 million acres per year. Slower growth in the early 1980s reflected `` adjustments to crop surpluses and low prices,'' the report said. <PERSON> Hostetler </PERSON> added Wednesday in a telephone interview that last year's severe drought will `` encourage people to at least think about irrigation,'' and that some will invest in new systems or expand operations as a result. He said it's too early to conclude whether irrigation is back on an expansion track because all the figures are n't in yet. The report said the national figures mask regional trends. For example, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and Mountain regions account for more than half the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> irrigated area. In 1987, the two regions had 24.1 million acres under irrigation, down about 2 million acres from 1982 but almost 700,000 acres more than in 1983. Last year, the West had poor soil moisture prior to planting and there was reduced streamflow during the crop growing season. The irrigated area was cut back to 23.9 million acres. In 1982, the area was 26 million acres. In the plains states, which straddle the nation between the arid West and the humid East, irrigation grew to 13.7 million acres last year from 12.6 million in 1987. But that was well behind the 15.3 million acres in 1982. In 1983, however, the irrigated area plummeted to 11.5 million acres. `` Because much of the irrigation water in the southern plains is pumped from deep wells that have declining water tables, energy costs represent a substantial share of production costs,'' the report said. `` Irrigated area declined in 1974 and 1982, following steep rises in natural gas prices.'' The East had a record 8.2 million acres under irrigation last year, up from 7.7 million in 1987 and 7.6 million in 1982, the report said. `` Irrigation has more than quadrupled since 1969 in the Corn Belt and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> states,'' the report said. `` In these regions, irrigation is supplemental, and there is strong evidence that weather affects irrigated acreage.'' The East's irrigation is also supplemental, used when and if needed. Last year's drought helped push irrigation to a record level, the report said.

 The government's <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in the red and the figure could reach $ 10 billion by 1992, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says. `` With the billions it will cost to fix the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> fresh on our minds we must surely face the <ORGANIZATION> Eximbank </ORGANIZATION>'s insolvency, which was heedlessly disregarded by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration,'' the chairman, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> was referring to the savings and loan crisis. The <ORGANIZATION> Eximbank </ORGANIZATION> lends mostly to Third World countries to encourage sales of American goods. `` The Export-Import clearly fulfills a very useful, even essential purpose,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` It creates jobs domestically and helps our export industry lower our massive trade deficit. `` But the <ORGANIZATION> Eximbank </ORGANIZATION> is insolvent. This means the budget deficit and cost of subsidizing our export industry are both understated by $ 4 to $ 6 billion. `` We have seen with the tragic <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> crisis that masking the true insolvency of a government agency has disastrous results and the taxpayer ultimately bears the burden of this irresponsibility.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, the bank's acting president, replied that normal accounting practices do not apply because the bank is backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> complained that it still carries as assets loans made to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> before President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> took over and to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> before the victory of the Communists on the mainland. `` <ORGANIZATION> Eximbank </ORGANIZATION> has not received a cent on these loans in over 40 years,'' he said. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said these were debts of sovereign countries and there is some hope of collecting them. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> spoke at a hearing of his panel's subcommittee on international development. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> was appearing before it to say that demand for the bank's loans last year exceeded its $ 693 million ceiling by $ 150 million, and it expected the same thing to happen again in the year that ends Sept. 30. `` As a result, we may again have to defer $ 150 million to $ 250 million in authorizations into 1990,'' he said.

 The makers of Rolling Rock beer believe they have steered around a bottleneck and are nearing a solution on how to comply with a new law requiring warning labels on beer bottles. The law requires that alcoholic beverage containers carry labels warning of possible adverse health effects from drinking wine, liquor or beer by Nov. 18. But <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Latrobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s distinctive green Rolling Rock bottles carry painted, rather than paper, labels. Therefore, the law would make as many as 1 million cases of <LOCATION> Rolling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> _ each containing 24 bottles of beer _ obsolete because the cost to alter them is prohibitive. The answer may be a grace period during which <LOCATION> Latrobe </LOCATION> would be permitted to print the warning on bottle caps instead of on the containers. `` We're a small player and we do n't want to send out a message that something special is being done for <LOCATION> Latrobe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinelli </PERSON>, vice president of operations, said Wednesday. `` All we're looking for is a time period to phase out the existing bottles as we bring new bottles in,'' he said. `` In the meantime, we've had samples made up with the -LRB- warning -RRB- message on the cap, and it's legible.'' Writing the 41-word warning on the cap would be only a temporary solution. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> specified that the warning must appear on containers and that the print on bottles 12 ounces and larger must be at least two millimeters tall. The law also would affect Rolling Rock's seven-ounce bottles. Rolling Rock has refused to change to a paper label because it feels the painted label gives it its distinctive identity. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, D-Pa., has received permission from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to insert language in a spending bill that would grant Rolling Rock a grace period, <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said Wednesday The bill is likely to be considered by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> within a week. It is uncertain how long <LOCATION> Latrobe </LOCATION> might have to fully comply with the law. <LOCATION> Latrobe </LOCATION> has said it could take 10 years before the 24 million bottles wear out, or get broken or lost, although the brewery does not expect to win a grace period nearly that long. On the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> side, <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, the author of the law, has indicated he wants to accommodate <LOCATION> Latrobe </LOCATION> officials if he can, according to aides to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa. `` Everybody seems to agree this is a unique situation,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said `` Everybody seems agreeable.''

<HEAD>Union Preparing For Strike To Protest Mobil's Pullout Tactics</HEAD>

 The union representing most black <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said Thursday it is preparing for a strike to protest the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company's refusal to negotiate terms of its planned pullout. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said a strike ballot was planned for next week. If approved, she said, a strike would be launched against <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> and other multinational companies that have not complied with a union demand to negotiate terms favorable to workers in the event of disinvestment from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company operating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, announced April 28 that it was selling its holdings in the country to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a conglomerate known as <ORGANIZATION> Gencor </ORGANIZATION>, which owns a petroleum company. The sale price was not disclosed, and the ownership change will not take effect until various financial arrangements are completed. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Gencor </ORGANIZATION> had pledged to continue the company's employment policies and honor all existing agreements with the union But union officials nonetheless were angered, saying <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> had rebuffed past attempts to open negotiations by insisting there were no plans for disinvestment. Of <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,800 employees in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, about 1,500 are black, including about 1,200 represented by the chemical workers union. The union had approached several foreign companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>, with a request for certain arrangements in the event of disinvestment. Among the demands were 12-month advance notice, guarentees of job security and full disclosure of the terms of sale. The union has applied to the Industrial Court for an order halting the planned <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> sale. A hearing on the application began Tuesday, but the case was postponed until May 24 and <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> representatives said they would try to provide the union with full information about the pullout. In a related development this week, a syndicate of black and Indian businessmen from <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>, site of the main <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> refinery, said they would try to outbid <ORGANIZATION> Gencor </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s assets. A spokesman for the group, <PERSON> Mangalpersaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariram </PERSON>, said the businessmen had access to about $ 120 million. Scores of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies have withdrawn from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in recent years, citing economic considerations and pressure from the anti-apartheid movement. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said the disinvestment dceision was motivated by `` business considerations,'' including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislation which has made it more difficult for American companies to make profits in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to create an Employee Stock Ownership Plan to help pay for employee retirement accounts, not fend off unwanted takeovers. The company said Wednesday it plans to establish the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> and buy back up to 10 million shares in the next year. Such plans have been used to thwart takeover attempts by putting more stock in friendly hands, but the 3M plan will put less than 4 percent of the company's outstanding common stock into the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> 3M </ORGANIZATION>'s program manager for investor relations. `` It is not being adopted as a takeover defense,'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said. `` It's being done because it's a more cost-effective way to finance contributions to retirement accounts.'' 3M will borrow $ 550 million to fund the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> with 7.5 million new shares of common stock. The shares will be allocated to employees over a 15-year period. Even though 3M for years has been giving stock to its employees as part of retirement plans, it had never officially established an <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said. Under the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>, 3M will be able to deduct for tax purposes both the principal and interest on the borrowings, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said. In addition, certain tax benefits to the lenders will allow 3M to borrow the money at lower rates. <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> declined to say how much money 3M will save under the strategy. In a related action, 3M's board authorized the company to repurchase up to 10 million shares between May 31, 1989, and June 1, 1990. The purchases, expected to be made on the open market, will be used to replace the previously authorized shares sold to the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>, for existing employee stock plans, and for other corporate needs, 3M said.

The nation's No. 1 soup company settled a year-old dispute Wednesday with nine states over advertised claims that it soups provide health benefits and may help prevent some types of cancer. `` Where we make a specific claim, it has to be true,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` If we say something is promoting good health, we've got to be able to document that.'' The agreement does not affect a complaint filed against <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> in January by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which accused the company of overstating the health benefits of its chicken noodle soup. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> advertisements misled consumers by failing to alert them of the soup's sodium content, the agency charged. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> halted the ads challenged by the nine states a year ago, but <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said the company plans to fight the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> complaint. `` We're standing by the ad and we're going to court and prove our case,'' said <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>. Camden-based <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> sells about 5 billion cans of soup a year, garnering about 65 percent of the $ 2.2 billion retail soup market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It's advertising claims have come under heavy criticism from the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Since 1983, the Washington-based consumer group has twice asked the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to review <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s advertising and sodium content claims. `` The amount of sodium and salt in the soups is a serious concern,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a staff attorney for the group. `` Most of their soups are so high in sodium that the increased risk of high blood pressure from the soups might outweigh any other positive benefits that are or are not in the soups.'' The agreement announced Wednesday ended an 11-month-old dispute. The states contended that <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s ads `` generally mischaracterized the health effects of <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s soup products,'' said <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanaway </PERSON>. Among them, he said, were high fiber claims about products that were not high in fiber, calcium source claims about soupsthat are not a good source of calcium and claims that its bean and pea soups can prevent `` some kinds of cancer.'' Under the settlement, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> agreed to pay the states $ 35,000 each and to change certain advertising practices. The money will be used by each state for consumer education and aid. `` This settlement helps send the message to food marketers that they can not claim falsely that a product is high in desirable nutrients,'' said <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> also worked with attorneys general of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in reaching the settlement. `` This type of action by this many states is unprecedented,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. `` It reinforces our belief that state governments will continue to be the most reliable watchdog for consumers.'' In early 1988, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> voluntarily halted the advertising campaign that focused on the theme `` Soup is Good Food,'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. The company resumed using the theme: `` Mm! Mm! Good,'' which had not been used since the 60s, he said. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> spent more than $ 200 million on advertising, <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. Current figures were not available, he said. The company, which produces 6 million cans of soup daily, said that it chose not to fight the matter in court because of the `` peripheral nature'' of the dispute and of the drain on <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> resources that would result from pursuing the matter in each of the nine states. `` We're not accepting any guilt and they're not giving any,'' said <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>. `` This was a settlement that we could live with.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> formally pledged Thursday to help each other fight pollution emergencies in northern waters like the oil tanker spill that fouled sections of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s coastline this spring. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> signed the agreement on the last day of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s two-day visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It pledges superpower cooperation in combating spills of oil and other pollutants in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chukchi </LOCATION> seas between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the agreement provides for the development of a `` joint plan of drastic measures'' in the event of a spill. Each country is required to notify the other immediately of a pollution emergency, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials will hold joint exercises on fighting ocean pollution, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The signing of the agreement is a major step toward developing Soviet-American cooperation in dealing with the consequences of ecological disaster at sea,'' <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalimonov </PERSON>, an official in the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. `` The developed mechanism of interaction will allow specialists to define within hours the scope of an accident, map out joint measures to overcome its consequences and get down immediately to their implementation,'' <PERSON> Khalimonov </PERSON> said. `` Earlier such procedures took days and sometimes whole weeks.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the cooperation envisaged by the agreement began to function even before <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> signed the formal document. A Soviet ship designed to skim the surface of the sea was hired to help clean up the oil spilled by an Exxon tanker off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in late March. However, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials, who were paying the Soviets $ 15,000 a day for the aid, said Tuesday the ship was being sent home because it was not designed to handle the hardened, taffylike mass the oil spilled by the tanker has turned into.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has suspended 11 traders, three permanently, following a probe into a multimillion dollar illegal trading scandal, news reports said. The Excelsior news service reported late Wednesday that the suspensions followed an investigation into the October 1987 crash. <PERSON> Excelsior </PERSON> said commission head <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> disclosed the suspensions late Wednesday and quoted him as saying that the act was unprecedented. Exclesior and the government news service <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> identified those suspended permanently from trading as: <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Villar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguero </PERSON>, operations manager for <ORGANIZATION> Bursamex </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, a promotions director for the <ORGANIZATION> Casa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bolsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Casa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bolsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fimsa </ORGANIZATION>. The other eight, primarily directors and high-ranking officials of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s trading houses, were suspended from stock market operations for periods ranging from three to 12 months, <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> reported that the commission issued official warnings to an additional 31 traders and doled out administrative sanctions against another 42. <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> did not specify the type of sanctions. The investigation followed complaints filed by at least 200 investors against all but one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 24 registered brokerage firms after stockholders lost millions of dollars' worth of holdings in the 1987 crash. The alleged violations ranged from insider trading in both stocks and foreign currencies to the sale of nonexistent <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> certificates and trading in securities without client consent. Following the investigation, officials in February arrested <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Legorreta </PERSON>, board chairman and one of the founders of <ORGANIZATION> Operadora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bolsa </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s two leading trading firms, and <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceballos </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervantes </PERSON>, the company's director of investment promotions.

However, analysts cautioned that the jitters plaguing the market the last few days could return later in the session if the final day of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s borrowing produces unfavorable results.

 Royal <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> reported a 55 percent surge in first-quarter earnings Thursday, partly because of gains from property sales. British <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> reported first-quarter earnings more than doubled because of higher oil prices and a one-time gain <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION> said earnings for the first three months of the year totaled 1.28 billion pounds or $ 2.1 billion, up from 825 million pounds a year earlier. Both companies' financial statements are based on British accounting methods and can not be directly compared with those of most American companies. Inventories are valued on the basis of the first-in, first-out or <ORGANIZATION> FIFO </ORGANIZATION> system, versus the the typical American system of last-in, first out, or LIFO. On a current cost, or LIFO basis, which values the company's oil inventories at current market prices, <ORGANIZATION> Royal-Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings rose a more modest 22 percent to 1.1 billion pounds or $ 1.8 billion, from 903 million pounds a year earlier. Earnings per share for <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the Dutch arm which controls 60 percent of the company, rose to 5.54 Dutch guilders or $ 2.64, vs. 3.31 guilders a year ealrlier. Earnings per share for <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, the British arm which controls the remaining 40 percent, rose to 14.1 pence or 24 cents, from 9.1 pence a year earlier First-quarter sales rose 5 percent 14.3 billion pounds or $ 23.9 billion, up from 13.63 billion pounds a year earlier. The company had a 244 million-pound or $ 407 million gain from the sale of real estate, compared with a gain of 106 million pounds from property sales a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said exploration and production earnings fell, due to lower production volumes and natural gas prices and higher exploration expenses.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today it would sell <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s prestige fragrance business if its attempt to buy Avon for more than $ 2 billion succeeds. The business includes higher-priced perfumes like <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Oscar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renta </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deneuve </PERSON>, which are sold in stores instead of by <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s person-to-person sales force <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> said the business is expected to run up sales of more than $ 300 million this year. Spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said the company had no comment on <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s stated plan, which was in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> made its offer for <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> on Wednesday and urged its larger rival to stop its `` knee-jerk, defensive activities.'' <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> said it was not for sale, although its board of directors would evaluate the offer. Analysts predicted a long battle, complicated by the culture clash between <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s patriotic, pep-rally style and its larger rival's image as the home of the refined Avon Lady. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>, in partnership with <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, owns 10.3 percent of <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s outstanding common shares, but <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> is not participating in the purchase offer, <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> said. Avon rose $ 3.87 -LCB- a share at $ 39.87 -LCB- in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> consolidated trading, above <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 39-a-share offer. The spread between the stock price and <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s offer indicated speculators were betting a higher bid would emerge from <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> or another suitor. However, there also was speculation that Avon management would succeed in blocking the takeover, or that <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> would not be able to arrange financing for its offer. Analysts disagreed over whether a much higher bid for <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> was justifiable. While some valued the stock at up to $ 50 a share, <ORGANIZATION> Andrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> valued <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> at no more than about $ 41 a share based on its cash flow. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s bid places a value of $ 2.1 billion on <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>, based on nearly 54 million outstanding Avon common shares. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> would also have to acquire 18 million preferred shares which could be converted into common in the event of a takeover, adding about $ 700 million to the price. `` After careful consideration, we have concluded that our respective businesses are complementary ...,'' <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s letter said. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> reserved the right to lower its offering price if <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> took further defensive actions. It asked for a response to its offer from the board of directors by 5 p.m. EDT on May 24. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> assured Avon sufficient financing would be available in the form of bank loans. In a letter responding to <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> released late Wednesday, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> repeated that it was not for sale but said the board `` will review your proposal in due course, consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities.'' Avon spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal was `` conditional and unfinanced.'' Avon sells cosmetics, toiletries and household products and recorded worldwide sales of $ 3.06 billion last year. Most of its 1.5 million sales representatives are women who sell part-time, either door-to-door or to friends and co-workers. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> is a private consumer products sales company in <LOCATION> Ada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, closely held by co-founders <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Andel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVos </PERSON>. It has more than 1 million distributors and recorded retail sales of $ 1.8 billion in its last fiscal year. In an effort to block a possible bid, <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> this week filed a federal suit against the partnership in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on the grounds that <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> had not complied with federal securities laws ownership disclosure requirements. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> also has asked a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state court to rule on the legal validity of the company's shareholder rights stock plan, known as a poison pill, aimed at making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s chief operating officer, said <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> informed <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> as a courtesy that it was making a bid. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> was traveling Wednesday and not reachable for comment, a person in his office said.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices were modestly lower in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, partly in response to forecasts for rain in key crop-growing areas. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s new six-to-10 day outlook, issued late Wednesday, calls for rain next week in the central Plains and the western Corn Belt, two areas that have not shared in the general recovery from last summer's drought. The soybean and corn markets also were pressured by expectations for showers this weekend in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, analysts said. Additional selling of soybean futures stemmed from <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s statement this morning that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has not decided whether to subsidize the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean oil to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The market had expected a subsidized sale to be announced. Cautious trading was expected today ahead of this afternoon's <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> revised estimates of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter wheat crop, and of world supply and demand for corn and soybeans In early trading, wheat was 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.24 a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 2.77 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with May at $ 1.85 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 6 \ cents lower with May at $ 7.52 a bushel Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at 72.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .20 cent higher wiith May at 77.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .32 cent lower with June at 48 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .80 cent to .90 cent lower with May at 35 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled mostly lower on Wednesday while pork futures advanced.

 The tangled takeover battle between the two of the largest gold producers took another twist today as a federal judge declined to hold <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> in contempt of court _ for now. South African-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, largest gold producer in the noncommunist world, has been trying to acquire rival British-based <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> since last fall. Gold Fields and its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, sued in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to block the takeover and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> issued an injunction _ blocking <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> from acquiring more Gold Fields shares on antitrust grounds. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, incorporated in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, already held almost 30 percent of Gold Fields' shares and has tenders for about 25 percent more although <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>'s injunction bars <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> from buying those shares. Gold Fields owns 49 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gold producer. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Takeovers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> ordered Gold Fields to drop out of the American lawsuit, leaving <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> as the only obstacle to the $ 5.9 billion takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> said it would try to find a third-party bidder for <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> to hold <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> in contempt, claiming <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s maneuvering to try and find a buyer for <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>, as a way of forcing the American concern out of the litigation, violated <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>'s injunction. <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>, however, declined to find <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> in contempt for the time being. In a two-page order issued early today, <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> said he would entertain another request to hold <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> in contempt of court if it attempted to alter Gold Fields' interest in <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> so that it could n't vote its shares, which total 49.3 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> expressed concerns at a hearing Wednesday that if <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> could get a third party to acquire a large stake in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern they could effectively force it to drop the law suit blocking the takeover.

 Stock prices were mostly higher in early trading today as caution returned to the market amid uncertainty about inflation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 0.73 point to 2,375.18 at noon EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 0.37 point an hour earlier after a firmer start.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration today proposed rewriting the nation's major jobs training program, which was co-authored by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, to direct most spending to the poor and teen-agers. It also warned states that their programs will have to be improved to receive federal support. `` For years, the government has been distributing money to youth programs in a fragmented and piecemeal fashion, and sometimes without clear expectations of what these youths should achieve,'' Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on employment and productivity. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and three <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> participants who attended the hearing were meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this afternoon in a session designed to demonstrate the president's support for the changes. The amendments would significantly change the Job Training Partnership Act created by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, then a Republican senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the revisions were necessary because of the changing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workforce, not because of any major flaws in the program. `` But <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> can be made even better,'' she told the subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the act. `` Funds do not always reach the individuals and areas who need help the most. In some communities it is felt that the program does not always result in good jobs and a higher standard of living.'' The changes aim at ending a practice that has prompted criticism of <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> and other training programs, the `` creaming'' of applicants with some marketable skills in order to place them quickly in jobs with little future. They also would also separate youth-training efforts from the various adult programs in which they are now found. And both the state and federal governments would be required to do a far better job coordinating training programs with education, counseling and other services provided by federal, state and local governments. Most of the changes were recommended by an advisory panel named by former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. Some also have been suggested by subcommittee members, including the panel's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> he was sure that Democrats and Republicans could work out minor differences in their approaches to amending <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> `` I think we're going to get a good bill out of this committee that we're all going to be able to agree on,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, called <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> `` the singularly important work of this committee during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years,'' but said changing work-force demographics made revisions necessary. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> dedicated most of her testimony to how the changes would improve training for teen-agers, something she has said would be among her highest priorities as secretary. She said all youths and half the adults seeking enrollment in <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> programs would need to overcome illiteracy, other basic skills deficiencies or a poor school record. Teen parents and the homeless also would be given preference. And, for the first time, employers who accepted <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> money to help pay for summer jobs for youths would be required to provide some form of approved education or training. The changes, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, are designed to address projected shortages in the labor force and the related `` skills gap'' exacerbating shortages for jobs in high-tech and other industries. Department officials have said the amendments, if approved, likely would require a modest reduction in the number of people served by <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> made no reference to that in her prepared testimony. The federal government allocated $ 2.4 billion for <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> this year and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has requested stable funding for next year. <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> programs are expected to serve 1.9 million people this year. Because most of the money is spent to support programs administered by state and local agencies, the proposed changes include a number of guidelines those agencies would have to meet before being deemed eligible for <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> funding. At the state and local level, the proposed changes would for the first time require individual assessments of prospective trainees and, for those accepted into the programs, an individually tailored program to meet the distinct education, training and placement needs of each trainee. Removed would be guidelines that encouraged rapid job placement, something <ORGANIZATION> JTPA </ORGANIZATION> critics have said leads to `` creaming'' and placement of trainees in low-skill jobs with few career possibilities. Instead, program administrators would be encouraged to offer more thorough training, with their efforts monitored through a follow-up survey to determine a trainee's progress in the job market.

 House Democrats are rejecting as `` blue smoke and mirrors'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed solution to the savings and loan crisis, a move the administration contends may thwart an agreement not to raise taxes next year. In the biggest challenge yet to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign promise to reduce the federal deficit without new taxes, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 25-11 Wednesday to dump the $ 50 billion <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout costs on the government's budgets for fiscal 1989, 1990 and 1991. The amounts would not count against the Gramm-Rudman law's deficit limits, according to the plan, which Democrats contend would cost taxpayers $ 4.5 billion less than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal over the next 30 years An angry Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> called the vote a `` mistake'' and said it could lead to `` months of stalemate.'' `` If adopted, this action could force us to go back to square one on both the budget and the savings and loan plan,'' he said. `` This is not the way either to lower interest rates or solve the savings and loan crisis.'' Two Republicans _ Reps. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gradison </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ joined all 26 Democrats in rejecting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s off-budget financing scheme The Ways and Means alternative would swell this year's budget deficit by $ 9 billion or $ 10 billion and next year's by between $ 22 billion and $ 25 billion. All the money would go toward closing or merging some 350 insolvent thrift institutions that have lost an estimated $ 100 billion in federally insured deposits through poor and often fraudulent lending practices. `` This is the first step in ending the period of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s blue smoke and mirrors,'' said the committee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION> Prior to Wednesday's vote, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> met for an hour with committee members behind closed doors, repeating a threat to recommend that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto any <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L plan that _ without a tax increase or spending cuts elsewhere _ would raise the deficit. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats bowed to a similar threat last month, rejecting an alternative proposed by its banking committee chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., to put the entire bailout's cost on this year's budget The Ways and <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets again on May 18 to affirm its vote formally before the bill goes to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on the following week. But <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said he hopes his panel will not reopen the issue. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, an early proponent of including the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout's costs in the budget, said the committee's action Wednesday has breathed new life into a once-abandoned effort to force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hand. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus is pretty much on board now that <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> has said it wants this on the budget,'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. `` I think the odds are 70 percent to 80 percent that we'll win on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor.'' Both the administration's plan and the alternative separate the cost of cleaning up the S & amp; L mess from the Gramm-Rudman law, which requires a reduction in the federal deficit to less than $ 100 billion for the next fiscal year beginning in October. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal gets around the requirement by borrowing the $ 50 billion through a new off-budget government corporation and including only the $ 3.5 billion in interest costs as part of federal budget for the next three years. The Ways and Means measure allows the budget deficit to swell a total of $ 50 billion over that time, but exempts it from the official Gramm-Rudman target deficits of $ 136 billion this year, $ 100 billion in 1990 and $ 64 billion in 1991. `` Everybody knows that it's already breached,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., referring to the $ 163 billion deficit anticipated this year and assumptions that interest rates will fall to 5.5 percent so that the 1990 target can be met While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan prevented the cost of solving the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis from showing up on the budget, it also swelled the overall costs to taxpayers because higher interest rates would have to be paid on the borrowed $ 50 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates the savings in lower interest rates from what the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> did at $ 671 million over the first five years, $ 1.5 billion by the year 2000 and $ 4.5 billion over 30 years.

 Health authorities said Thursday 30,000 pigs have been destroyed because of a swine fever epidemic in <LOCATION> Modena </LOCATION> province, renowned for its salami and hams. It has caused losses estimated at $ 12 million, said the health office of this northern province where farmers breed nearly 1.3 million pigs a year. Bodies of the dead pigs were burned and officials ordered a massive vaccination program, the office said. Swine fever is caused by a highly contagious virus that spreads rapidly in crowded pig pens. If humans have contact with diseased animals or eat infected pork they can contract gastroenteritis, jaundice or skin diseases. The first case in the outbreak was reported April 23.

 Savings and loan customers withdrew $ 8.5 billion from their accounts in March, the government said today in a report that showed only slight improvement from the record pace set in the first two months of the year. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said net withdrawals for the first three months of 1989 totaled $ 28.5 billion _ more than triple the $ 8.4 billion in withdrawals for all of last year.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration sent legislation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today calling for a $ 500 million federal oil cleanup fund to be financed by a fee on domestic and imported oil. Officials said the government now has little money earmarked for such an emergency. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> outlined the administration's proposal for a comprehensive oil spill liability and compensation law, saying that in light of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> spill it is `` imperative to move quickly'' to establish a federal response fund. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and Navigation, promised that a bill for such a fund would be scheduled for a vote by the panel later this month <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s proposal prompted some subcommittee members to note that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has debated, but failed to enact, such a contingency fund for the past 15 years. `` It took a tragedy like the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> to cause the entire <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to focus on the issue,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., who is the sponsor of a bill already under consideration to establish a fund similar to the one proposed by the administration <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said that while the cost of the oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> on March 24 has yet to be determined, it could exceed the maximum of $ 500 million envisoned for the proposed cleanup fund Under the legislation proposed by the administration, an oil company or shipper would be liable to up to $ 78 million in cleanup, damage and recovery costs. Costs in excess of that would be covered by the federal fund, which would be collected over the next five years from a 1.3 cent-a-barrel fee on domestic and imported petroleum. When the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> tanker spilled 11 million gallons of oil in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> _ the worst spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history _ a federal oil spill contingency fund had only $ 4 million in it. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told the congressmen that had the spill been caused by someone with less resources than the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the government would have been left scrambling for money and asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for special appropriations. Whatever the price, officials said a day earlier, they doubt <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> can clean the oil from hundreds of miles of rocky <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coastline by next September as the oil company has said it hopes to do. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that it plans to sharply increase the number of workers assigned to coastal cleanup duties and deploy more barges and boats to the effort. The decision to increase manpower came after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier summer cleanup plans were inadequate But Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commandant, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing that despite the increased manpower, he considers it `` almost impossible'' for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to clean all the oil from more than 300 miles of shoreline by the Sept. 15 target date. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday that while <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> plans to complete the cleanup this summer, he considers it `` a massive, massive effort ... -LRB- and -RRB- a big challenge'' that might not be possible. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will closely monitor the effort and direct <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> back to work next spring if the cleanup does not meet expectations. Nevertheless, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, told openly skeptical senators the company `` fully expects to clean up'' the beaches by September, after which poor weather would likely make efforts impossible. Confronted by figures showing that only 1.7 miles of the 300 miles of shoreline have been cleaned so far, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said work started slowly because the company tackled the worst beaches first. He promised that even if the September deadline is met, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> will return in the spring to ensure the work is done. The company announced plans to increase the number of cleanup workers from 3,400 to 5,000 this summer after being told by <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and presidential chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> at a White House meeting Monday that earlier cleanup plans were inadequate. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> also said it would increase the number of barges and boats used in the cleanup, bringing the total to 70 vessels. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, however, expressed doubt in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the cleanup will be anything short of a long, arduous task. He described how his hands dripped with oil after he reached underneath the gravel on a beach that 200 workers had been cleaning for 10 consecutive days. Increasing the number of cleanup workers will not keep the oil from washing back onto the beaches, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> told the senators.

 The House today approved raising the hourly minimum wage from $ 3.35 to $ 4.55 by 1991, bringing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> just one step from its first domestic policy showdown with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has promised to veto the measure. The 247-172 vote followed brief debate. Democrats accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of turning his back on the working poor while Republicans said Democrats were passing up an opportunity to raise the minimum wage by accepting the president's offer of a more modest increase. `` What we consider today is a matter of elemental fairness,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said in a floor speech supporting the $ 4.55 target contained in the legislation drafted by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. `` It goes to the heart of what our country is all about.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said Democrats did not have the two-thirds majority vote to override <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s expected veto and were surrendering their chance for some increase in the minimum wage to fight a political battle with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` The people who are hurt are the people who could be making $ 4.25 an hour,'' said <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, referring to the final minimum-wage target in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote could come as early as next week. Both sides in the debate, so sure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will veto the legislation, already are hard at work drafting post-veto battle plans. `` If he vetoes it, then he has declared the end of the honeymoon,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, D-Pa.. `` I regret to say that, but if that is the case I think there will be no holding it back. The `` it'' to which <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> referred is a flood of Democratic-sponsored bills dealing with such issues as parental leave, child care, mandatory health insurance and others. `` A veto would tell other members there is no reason to say the president is trying to get along,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. `` That would undoubtably cause the sponsors of those bills to demand that they advance.'' After <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage, the Democratic congressional leadership plans a mock signing session at which it will try to bring pressure on the president. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly has promised that the legislation awaits the first veto of his presidency. Those urging the president to hold fast to that promise also are quick to bring up the lengthy Democratic domestic agenda. `` The labor agenda,'' is the term used by <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krebs </PERSON>. `` This has taken on such symbolism,'' <PERSON> Krebs </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` On legislative issues, things work much like they do in an athletic contest _ you want momentum. The implications of the minimum wage carry over to the entire labor agenda and also in a broader context for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration because they think they can win this one, and they need a few wins.'' Both sides view the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes as perfunctory, only gaining importance if Democrats can substantially cut into the strength <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now has to sustain a veto. That however, appears unlikely, leading to the intensified post-veto planning. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is being urged to take the initiative in that fight by venturing out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a veto ceremony in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> or West _ in a community where the administration can make its case that too large an increase in the minimum wage will result in major job losses. Business and labor are planning media campaigns through letters and columns submitted to newspapers and appearances on local television news programs in communities represented by lawmakers considered to be potential swing votes in an attempted veto override. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted a nationwide conference call Tuesday to plot strategy, also is working on a radio advertising campaign in hopes of bringing pressure on lawmakers who now side with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the expected override vote. Proponents of the bill also are trying to draft another minimum wage bill for quick consideration should they lose the veto fight, which appears likely. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said such a measure could take a number of forms, ranging from a one-year increase, during which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House could seek a long-term compromise, to a three - or four-year incremental plan not unlike the current bill That decision would depend largely on the language in any <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto message. `` If he tells us in that message that he wants to work it out and makes a suggestion, I'm sure we will try to work from that,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` If not, then it becomes a partisan battle and we'll go it alone. Without the votes to override a veto, sponsors of the current bill are asked increasingly whether they would eventually accept <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal if he alternative was a ninth consecutive year with the hourly minimum wage frozen at $ 3.35. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the choice would be the latter if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to soften his demand for a provision allowing newly hired employees to be paid a subminimum wage for six months. `` If that's the case there's no point in having a bill,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` The proponents will stick to their guns.''

<HEAD>Researchers Recommend High-Tech Trains to Replace Short-Haul Jets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Developing a network of magnetic-levitation trains to replace short-haul aircraft could save the airlines money and reduce airport congestion, some researchers say. Standing in the way of development of the `` maglev'' system is money and a lack of enthusiasm. `` The market for -LRB- maglev trains -RRB- is not well defined,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an economist and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Argonne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, who conducted a yearlong study with five colleagues. `` There is not a constituency that would push the idea.'' In a report soon to be made public, researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Argonne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> say the costs of building a 2,000-mile network of 300 mph magnetic-levitation trains would be largely offset by multibillion-dollar savings from reducing airline delays, energy costs and airplane acquisition. A maglev network could open gate slots at major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports to longer domestic and international flights, eliminating the need to build many new airports, the researchers said. Magnetic levitation uses powerful magnets to lift a train above a guideway and propel it at high speeds on a cushion of air. Although the technology exists, there are no maglev trains operating anywhere in the world. Skeptics suggest that a working, short-line demonstration model be built first to prove the feasibility of maglevs. Another obstacle is the high-speed conventional electric train, now in use in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and under development in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sudhir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON>, a professor of engineering and ground transportation at the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is right about the need to reduce air traffic congestion. But he said a maglev system would be too expensive. `` It would be cheaper than building another airport,'' he said. `` But even less expensive would be high-speed trains,'' which travel at speeds up to 200 mph. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said at speeds of 300 mph and distances up to 600 miles, maglevs could compete economically with aircraft. He said a maglev system linking <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with cities such as <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> could significantly reduce congestion at the world's busiest airport. `` If you want to expand longer-range domestic and international service at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, maglev certainly is a way of doing it,'' he said this week. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said more than half the flights arriving or departing daily at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> _ or about 1,100 of a total of 2,000 flights _ cover distances of less than 500 miles. The <ORGANIZATION> Argonne </ORGANIZATION> report estimates that delays and overcrowding at airports cost airlines $ 5 billion a year and that it would cost $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion to build each of the 15 to 20 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports that experts say are needed to expand the air-transport system into the next century. The maglev system could be built at a cost of $ 15 million a mile, and the cost of the individual vehicles is estimated at $ 2.5 million to $ 5 million each, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Maglevs could be operated on elevated structures built along existing interstate highways to link airports to cities in the region, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. For example, connecting <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> said trains that do n't use magnetic levitation such as <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s TGV or <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ICE offer advantages of cost, compatibility with existing track and the capability of hauling freight. `` High-speed trains are a proven technology, maglevs are not,'' he said, adding that a short line should be constructed to probe maglevs' feasibility. A Japanese firm has proposed constructing a 20-mile maglev line between the airport at <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>. The idea is being considered by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials.

 <PERSON> LaVonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Raney </PERSON> took a chance in a fledgling electronics firm she'd read about and bought a few shares at $ 15 each. The time was the early'60s. The company was <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Since then, its stock has shattered the stratosphere, trading lately at around $ 350 a share even after several splits. `` That was my biggest winner. It took three of us around the world twice,'' recalled Mrs. <PERSON> Raney </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, an amateur stock dabbler who has long since cashed her Teledyne treasure. There may not be any <PERSON> Teledynes </PERSON> left in the twilight of the 20th century. But that has n't stopped investors from pouring billions of dollars into what they see as potential gold mines _ startup businesses with products and services ranging from robot cashiers to toxic-waste neutralizers. A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company, for example, is working on a system that would prevent waste through recycling. Another is trying to perfect chemical-free purified water from industrial sewage. Others see riches in warehouse-like stores of the future that eliminate the middleman or take customer orders via sophisticated computers. `` Hitting it right usually requires a combination of foresight and luck,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sughrue </PERSON>, a researcher at <LOCATION> Needham </LOCATION>, Mass.-based <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which tracks trends in speculative investments. The foresight-luck mix was electronics in the'60s and computers in the 70s. People who foresaw that a company hatched in someone's garage would grow into today's <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, would have multiplied their investment many times over But investing in high-risk businesses is not for the timid. Like the professional poker plays say, do n't bet what you ca n't afford to lose. `` For every Apple ... there are probably 30 to 40 other companies you could lose money on,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feirstein </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's very difficult for an individual investor ... to get in the ground floor of something unless it's an industry he knows.'' Even Mrs. <PERSON> Raney </PERSON>, who profited enormously by beating the crowd on <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>, admits she stumbled into it and prefers to invest in more proven companies. Professional venture capitalists are n't flocking to any particular industry. A report by <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> shows that all the nearly $ 4 billion put in young companies in 1987 _ the latest year for which complete data was available _ was spread out, with no industry getting more than 15 percent. Experts envision growth in specific sectors in communications, consumer products and services, computer hardware and software and medicine, the Venture Economics data shows. Other areas receiving adventurous-investor interest include electronics, industrial products, biotechnology and energy. `` Within each industry there's a narrowly focused niche, and if you hit it right you can make it big,'' said <PERSON> Sughrue </PERSON>. Finding that niche is the hard part. `` We look at probably 500 to 800 business plans a year from people coming to us with ideas,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mumford </PERSON>, managing general partner at <ORGANIZATION> Crosspoint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Altos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` In addition, we go to a lot of trade shows, industry meetings, read literature in a variety of areas and try to forecast where opportunites may be,'' he said. The maturing population of baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, are likely to play an important role in what's valuable in the future. <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demographics </ORGANIZATION> magazine and author of `` 100 Predictions for the Baby Boom,'' says middle-aged boomers will transform the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into a more conservative, affluent nation, with the home the center of life. Here are a few key growth areas as seen by forward-thinking investment professionals:

 Severe labor shortages mean machines could replace humans for tasks that range from cashiering to burger flipping to gasoline dispensing. <PERSON> Sughrue </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> Checkrobot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, has developed an automated supermarket checkout system, and <ORGANIZATION> ByVideo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is developing a system that can take retail sales orders. <PERSON> Feirstein </PERSON> says automated bank-teller machine makers such as <ORGANIZATION> Diebold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, also could expand in this field.

 Inflation is growing so rapidly in health care that many corporate planners are aggressively seeking ways to cut costs. Look for an emergence in mail order prescriptions from pharmaceutical giants such as <ORGANIZATION> Baxter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Feirstein </PERSON> said. Specialized treatment may also become more prevalent. <PERSON> Mumford </PERSON> said he's backing a <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, company known as <ORGANIZATION> NeuroCare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, developing non-hospital rehabilitation for patients who've suffered head injuries. Biotechnology treatments for afflictions ranging from cancer to AIDS should become more common in the middle to late 1990s, many experts say. `` They're taking a lot of the things developed over the past 10 years and now using them both for disease treatment and diagnostics,'' said <PERSON> Mumford </PERSON>. Poised for possible growth, experts say, are companies like <ORGANIZATION> Biosurface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, which is developing synthetic skin. This area is especially risky. San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock skyrocketed before slumping on slower-than-expected sales of its blood clot dissolving drug, TPA.

 <PERSON> Mumford </PERSON> says tomorrow's consumers will want exceptionally cheap prices, superior services or both. He and others see an emergence in warehouse distributors that cut prices by selling directly to customers. `` Investments in that area nearly doubled from'86 to'87,'' said <PERSON> Sughrue </PERSON>. Staples, a <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, retailer that sells bargain office supplies warehouse-style, is already becoming popular.

<HEAD>Dollar Firm In Europe, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Strong demand in the absence of central bank intervention drove the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar higher against the major currencies in European trading on Thursday. Gold prices also rose after dipping in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Dealers said the news that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail sales in April rose by a lower than expected 0.4 percent failed to shake confidence in the American currency. One <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer said the day's performance confirmed the underlying demand for dollars and the market's reluctance to sell them. The central banks again made no effort at a concerted intervention to bring the dollar's exchange rate down by selling dollars, although dealers said they can be expected to enter the market if the dollar rises much above 1.92 West German marks. The dealers said the absence of intervention suggests that the central banks tacitly acknowledged their sales of dollars had been unable to bring the exchange rate down. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.6655 late Thursday, cheaper for buyers than Wednesday's late $ 1.6717. Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Wednesday's late rates: 1.9135 West German marks, up from 1.9047; 1.7060 Swiss francs, up from 1.6925; 6.4665 French francs, up from 6.4645; 2.1580 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1500; 1,395.75 Italian lire, up from 1,390.125; 1.1870 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1849. Gold bullion prices improved slightly in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Gold traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the major market, at a bid price of $ 379.00 a troy ounce, up from $ 377.25. The late bid price in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> was $ 378.20, up from $ 376.75. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> gold closed at $ 377.25, down from $ 378.25. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid $ 5.66 a troy ounce, down from $ 5.68.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> hopes to announce in June where its 6,000-employee Merchandising Group will be moved, but is `` nowhere near'' a decision now, Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said Thursday. `` All I can say is that we're looking very hard at all of the alternatives,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> told reporters following the company's annual meeting `` The truth is that we really do n't have all of the costs laid out.'' Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> announced that <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedien </PERSON>, 55, had been named chairman and chief executive of its <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The appointment takes effect on July 1 on the retirement of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haayen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hedien </PERSON> has been president of <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> since October 1986. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiefer </PERSON>, 62, succeeds him in that job. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said officials including Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> were working to hard to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. He would not discuss what incentives were offered or compare them to those offered by other states. He declined to comment on reports that the company is looking at sites in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, but did say <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> will not move the <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> to northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s news conference followed the company's first annual meeting since it announced last October that it would sell the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> _ the world's tallest building _ offer more brand-name products and shift to everyday low prices. `` In 1988, a year of transition, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> demonstrated that it is a very strong company,'' he said. `` For the first time, we exceeded $ 50 billion in revenues, an increase of 9.5 percent. `` We also recorded the second most profitable year in our history: $ 1.45 billion. Yet we should do better, and I have every confidence that we will,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said company officials would like to keep most major operations headquartered in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area for `` emotional reasons.'' But he said <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> would need at least 1 million square feet to house the <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, space that would be greater than most of the parcels it owns in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> also reported that <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> expects $ 1.5 billion in revenues this year from specialty stores: Western Auto, <ORGANIZATION> Eyecare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NTW </ORGANIZATION> and Pinstripes Petites. `` Each of these companies, acquired in the last year, has a winning formula for success,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plans to spin off <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s retail operation, comprising the popular <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> perfume and other fragrances, if its $ 2 billion takeover bid for <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> succeeds, <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The company disclosed in a document submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that it would retain <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s worldwide direct selling division if acquires its much larger rival. Put up for sale would be the business responsible for fragrances <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> owns that are sold by department stores and other retailers, but not by the independent sales representatives who offer <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s makeup, toiletries and jewelry <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> also said it would continue <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s strategy of selling its interests in the health care services field. The retail operation includes higher-priced, `` prestige'' perfumes such as <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, Red, and Uninhibited by <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>. Avon expects to more than $ 300 million in retail division sales this year. Most of Avon's sales, which totaled $ 3.06 billion in 1988, are made through an international sales force of about 1.5 million representatives. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s chief operating officer, said in a telephone interview that several parties have expressed interest in buying the Avon retail division. He declined to identify them. Several consumer products companies have stated their intentions to expand and a well-established, successful prestige perfume line might be a lucrative addition. <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> finds <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> an attractive takeover prospect partly because ownerhip of <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> would open the door to markets <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to enter. `` Avon is well established in some international markets that'd we'd love to get into,'' he said, naming <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> as examples Latin American countries have sufficient incomes to support significant growth in their direct sales markets. So far, <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> is operating only in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> also was motivated to pursue <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> by the opportunity to turn <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s sales representatives into distributors of a wider array of products. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>, a privately held company based in <LOCATION> Ada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, has about 1 million distributors around the world selling <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> household, personal care and environmental products. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> distributors also sell <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> computer gear, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> services, office coffee making equipment and other brand name products. <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> has failed so far to capitalize on its cosmetics business and broaden it into a full health and beauty aids operation. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s cosmetic interests represent only a small portion of the company's operations so an acquisition of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> would cause little duplication. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 39-a-share takeover proposal places a value of about $ 2.1 billion on the company based on nearly 54 million outstanding Avon common shares. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> also would have to acquire 18 million preferred shares which could be converted into common in the event of a takeover, adding about $ 700 million to the price. Speculators on Wall Street have indicated they believe that a higher bid may be forthcoming. Avon shares closed at $ 39.50, off 37 -LCB- cents, in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Thursday, after gaining $ 3.87 -LCB- on Wednesday. Avon Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> has said repeatedly the company is not for sale but has said <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s board would give <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s offer consideration. To bolster its defense against <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> has sued <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> and its investment partner <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. The partnership has said they own about 10.3 percent of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> common stock. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> investor, is not involved in <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover offer But in its <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing, <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> may `` explore the possibility of purchasing'' some of <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s assets if the takeover succeeds but `` no agreement, arrangement or understanding has been reached.'' Avon spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said the company had no comment on information in <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s filing. <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> is awaiting a response from <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>. `` We believe that the board will invite us in for discussion and we're waiting for that invitation,'' <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday to raise the minimum wage to $ 4.55 an hour by October 1991, leaving only a final <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote before the bill goes to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has promised to veto it. In the first major domestic policy dispute of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, neither house of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has backed down despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s insistence that the minimum should be raised only to $ 4.25 by January 1992 _ and then only if the proposal allows employers to pay a lower `` training wage'' to new workers for six months. The minimum is now $ 3.35, where it has been since 1981. The only congressional action still required is a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on the bill drafted by <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, and that could come as early as next week. There is virtually no doubt that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will follow through on his promise to veto the measure and the 247-172 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote for passage suggested the Democrats remain short of the two-thirds majority it would need to override the president. `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> insisted on sending President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a bill that would cost hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> their opportunity to work _ a bill he most certainly will veto,'' Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote. Still, Democratic leaders in both chambers have promised to attempt an override. In the meantime, Democrats hope to bring public pressure on the White House by characterizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position as unfair to the working poor and by juxtaposing his veto threat with his plan to spend billions of dollars to rescue troubled savings and loans and his proposal to lower capital gains tax rates. `` The wealthiest of the wealthy would get tax breaks big enough to hire two minimum wage workers each to take care of their gardens or do their laundry,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>. `` Is this the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> full employment program? Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the `` meager increase'' included in the legislation still would leave the minimum wage trailing inflation increases since the wage floor last was raised. `` Today we seek to provide fairness for the working poor of this country,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` There are at least 4 million of them who receive no more than the minimum wage.'' Republicans, however, said Democrats were passing up an opportunity to increase the minimum wage by accepting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s more modest offer and instead had decided on waging a political battle with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for control of the domestic-policy agenda. The Republicans also reiterated their contention that raising the minimum wage without also establishing a six-month subminimum for newly hired workers would trigger massive job losses. `` The bottom line is it will cost at least 650,000 new jobs in three years, the very people that we want to bring into the workforce to help them become productive members of society,'' Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said of the bill passed Thursday. `` There can be no further compromise that throws people out of work. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has offered the compromise.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had proposed raising the minumum wage to $ 4.25 an hour by January 1992 provided employers could pay new hires the `` training wage'' for six months. In rejecting that offer, Democratic leaders said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed increase was too small and also assailed his `` training wage'' because the provision requires no actual training. In their final bill, Democrats allowed workers with less than 60 days of work experience to be paid a subminimum. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, much like the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, sponsors have more than enough votes to gain passage of the measure but seem short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. `` If he vetoes it, then he has declared the end of the honeymoon,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, D-Pa. The result of a veto, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said, will be action on a lengthy list of Democrat-sponsored bills dealing with such issues as parental leave, child care and mandatory health insurance. `` A veto would tell other members there is no reason to say the president is trying to get along,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. `` That would undoubtedly cause the sponsors of those bills to demand that they advance.'' But administration aides have said one of the reasons <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will veto the minimum-wage bill is to assert his position on domestic policy to prevent the Democrats' agenda from gaining momentum. Business and labor groups plan media campaigns and other lobbying efforts to pressure lawmakers considered to be potential swing votes in an attempted veto override. Proponents of the bill also are trying to draft another minimum wage bill for quick consideration should they lose the veto fight, which appears likely.

 The dollar gained value against most major currencies Thursday despite further evidence of a slowdown in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth. Gold prices rose, partly in response to the tension in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Foreign-exchange dealers said demand for dollars appeared unaffected by a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that retail sales rose by only 0.4 percent in April. Economists said the weak sales figure showed the extent to which higher interest rates and inflation are discouraging consumer spending. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalzer </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Amsterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rotterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said there was no indication that central banks intervened in the currency markets to influence exchange rates. `` Until we get some concerted intervention, where they really mean business, the dollar will continue to go up,'' she said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.6655 late Thursday, cheaper for buyers than late Wednesday's $ 1.6717. Sterling weakened against the dollar in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, ending the day at $ 1.6645 compared with $ 1.6740 on Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with Wednesday's late rates included: 1.9160 West German marks, up from 1.9020; 135.37 Japanese yen, up from 134.41; 1.7080 Swiss francs, up from 1.6921; 1.1870 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1843; 6.4755 French francs, up from 6.4220; and 1,395.75 Italian lire, up from 1,385.25 Late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Wednesday's late rates: 1.9135 West German marks, up from 1.9047; 1.7060 Swiss francs, up from 1.6925; 6.4665 French francs, up from 6.4645; 2.1580 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1500; 1,395.75 Italian lire, up from 1,390.125; and 1.1870 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1849 Gold prices were bid higher as traders considered the implications of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to send combat troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Frequently during times of political unrest or other uncertainty, investors buy gold as a safe haven for their money. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was sending 2,000 combat troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and evacuating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependents to protect Americans from the violence that started after the country's presidential elections. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 379.40 for a troy ounce of gold bullion at 4 p.m. EDT, up from late Wednesday's bid of $ 376.60 Earlier gold bullion for current delivery rose $ 3.30 a troy ounce to $ 381 on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 A federal judge declined to hold <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> in contempt of court Thursday, giving the South Africa-linked gold producer a victory in its tangled takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> said he might reconsider his decision if <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> tries to prevent Gold Fields from voting its shares in an American mining concern. Last fall, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, which is largely controlled by two South African corporations, <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, launched a hostile takeover bid for Gold Fields. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> corporation, already held almost 30 percent of Gold Fields' shares. British-based Gold Fields and its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest gold producer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, sued in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to block the takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>. Last October, <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> issued an injunction barring <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> from acquiring more Gold Fields shares on antitrust grounds. He noted that the combined entities would control nearly a third of the non-communist world's gold market. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> now owns or has tenders for about 55 percent of Gold Fields' shares, but <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>'s injunction bars <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> from buying those shares it does n't own. Gold Fields owns 49.3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Takeovers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> ordered Gold Fields to drop out of the American lawsuit, leaving <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> as the only obstacle to the $ 5.9 billion takeover. But unless <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> can get <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw its lawsuit, the bid for Gold Fields will expire next Wednesday under British regulations. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, which previously promised to divest itself of <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> if allowed to complete the takeover, has been trying to find a bidder for the shares of <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> not owned by Gold Fields. <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> expressed concerns at a hearing Wednesday that if <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> could get an ally to buy 51 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> could break the effective control over <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> that Gold Fields now has with its 49 percent stake. Then <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> could effectively force <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> to drop the lawsuit blocking the takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> to hold <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> in contempt, claiming <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s maneuvering to try and find a buyer for <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> violated <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>'s injunction. <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>, however, declined to find <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> in contempt for now. In a two-page order issued early Thursday, <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> said he would entertain another request to hold <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> in contempt if it took any steps that altered Gold Fields' effective control over <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> until Monday to reply in writing to <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s latest request to dissolve the injunction. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> will make its counter reply on Tuesday and has until Wednesday to complete the bid for Gold Fields or let it lapse.

 Stock prices rose slightly Thursday in restrained trading that reflected uncertainties over news from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the progress of a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> debt auction and an upcoming report on inflation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.43 to 2,382.88. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 785 issues up, 602 down and 568 unchanged. After an early selloff, the market moved higher behind strengthening bond prices, which rose on a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report of lower-than-expected retail sales figures for April. The government said retail sales rose a modest 0.4 percentage point last month. Analysts said the number pointed to a slower economy, giving the markets impetus to move out of their recent slump by signaling lower interest rates. But activity remained subdued with investors awaiting the final day of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 28.75 billion three-day round of borrowing. There was uncertainty over how a new glut of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> debt would be absorbed. Many market participants also withdrew in nervous reaction to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement he was sending more troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` That kept some traders on the sidelines wondering what steps might be taken there,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Otherwise, we might have had a better response.'' The market has spent most of the week waiting for April producer price numbers, which it hopes will provide a clearer indication of inflation in the economy. Observers said last Friday's jobless report confused investors, because while it showed higher unemployment and a slowing economy, it also showed that wages rose substantially in April, suggesting inflation is still a problem. The producer price report is scheduled for release Friday morning. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 151.62 million shares, up from 146 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 179.12 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market rose $ 9.645, or 0.32 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 0.58 to 171.71. Among actively traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, Avon fell -RRB- to 39 -LCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> lost -RRB- to 4 | and <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> dropped -LCB- to 109 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, surged 6 -LCB- to 72 on news that the company would consider takeover offers. Block Enterprises also rose 1 -LRB- to 27 -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 -LRB- to 49. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 1.33 to 353.48, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index gained 1.15 to 306.95. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 0.99 to 430.63. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 345.62, up 0.82.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Rise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The energy futures market rebounded sharply Thursday on technical factors, with gasoline prices showing particular strength. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, settled 54 cents higher at $ 20.06 a barrel. The contract had fallen 24 cents on Wednesday. Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, wholesale unleaded gasoline for June delivery jumped 2.56 cents to 67.28 cents a gallon after losing 0.80 cent on Wednesday. June heating oil, which rose 0.49 cent Wednesday, settled at 48.68 cents a gallon, up another 1.20 cents. Longer-term contracts showed smaller gains. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Redoglia </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>, said the gains resulted from a technical reaction to a sharp decline in prices in previous sessions as well as from concern over the political situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> following Sunday's presidential election `` The market has just found itself in a real nervous position,'' <PERSON> Redoglia </PERSON> said. Some of the concern may be unfounded in terms of endangering the supply of oil. Although Alaskan crude moves through a pipeline in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> en route to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, analysts noted that the volume of oil carried is not significant. Gains in gasoline prices were particularly strong. Traders said prices that were knocked down in previous sessions presented investors with an incentive to buy.

 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply fell in the week ended May 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,071.3 billion from $ 3,082.1 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,953.2 billion from $ 3,965.5 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 781.7 billion from $ 786.9 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in M3. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,076.9 billion, a 1.6 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,969.4 billion, up 3.7 percent, while M1 fell 1.1 percent to an average of $ 787.3 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 522 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 687 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said net free reserves totaled $ 670 million in the two weeks ended May 3, up from net borrowed reserves of $ 377 million in the two weeks ended April 19 _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 290.2 billion in the two-week period ended May 3, up from $ 288.3 billion two weeks earlier

 Crude oil futures prices climbed back above $ 20 a barrel Thursday and petroleum-product prices soared in a rally bolstered by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to send combat troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. On other markets, grain and soybean futures fell; precious metals advanced; cattle prices rose and pork futures were mixed. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude settled unchanged to 54 cents higher with the contract for delivery in June at $ 20.06 a barrel; heating oil was .07 cent to 1.20 cents higher with June at 48.68 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .80 cent to 2.56 cents higher with June at 67.28 cents a gallon. June crude, which reached a recent high of $ 21.60 a barrel on April 26, dropped below $ 20 on Monday. Technical factors played a large role in Thursday's surge but the Panamanian situation `` seemed to take on more importance as the day wore on,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Traders fear a military conflict in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> could affect the daily movement of 400,000 barrels of crude through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Unconfirmed reports that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to send troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> circulated during the trading session. After the close <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was sending about 2,000 troops and evacuating dependents to protect Americans in the turmoil arising from a presidential election that the White House condemned as `` electoral theft'' by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Soybean futures ended sharply lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid forecasts of rain and disappointment over the government's reluctance to subsidize a sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean oil to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Wheat and corn futures also retreated. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s new six-to-10-day outlook, issued late Wednesday, calls for rain next week in the central Plains and the western Corn Belt, two areas that have not shared in the general recovery from last summer's drought. Soybean and corn futures also were pressured by expectations for showers this weekend in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, analysts said. Additional selling of soybean futures stemmed from <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s statement Thursday morning that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had not decided whether to subsidize the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean oil to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The market had expected a subsidized sale to be announced. After the markets closed, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a report estimating 1989 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter wheat production at a decade low of 1.43 billion bushels. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s winter wheat estimate represented an 8 percent drop from last year's harvest of 1.56 billion bushels. The report was expected to prompt new buying of wheat futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. Wheat settled 1 -RCB- cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.28 a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 3 \ cents lower with May at $ 2.76 \ a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with May at $ 1.84 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 6 -RCB- cents to 10 \ cents lower with May at $ 7.51 -LCB- The rise in oil prices spurred a moderate advance in precious-metal prices, which tend to increase with signs of higher inflation. Gold settled $ 2.30 to $ 3.30 higher with June at $ 382.10 a troy ounce; silver was 3.8 cents to 4.8 cents higher with July at $ 5.735 a troy ounce. Most cattle futures ended slightly higher in light trading after weakening earlier in the session. Pork futures settled mostly lower amid profit-taking after two days of steep gains. Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .30 cent higher with June at 72.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .28 cent higher with May at 77.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .07 cent higher with June at 48 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .75 cent lower to .45 cent higher with May at 35.05 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
 The government said in federal court Thursday several former top executives of <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were involved in a scheme to pay bribes to <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officials to get tire business. The <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, company paid a $ 250,000 fine after pleading guilty to a single count of violating the anti-bribery provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. The firm is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. From the fall of 1979 to the fall of 1983, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> obtained $ 19 million in <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government orders for truck tires based on an agreement to pay nearly $ 1 million in bribes, according to documents released in court The activities were carried out by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Janasik </PERSON>, then the company's regional export manager for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Also involved were senior <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> officials including the ex-director of export operations and the former executive vice president, the documents said. <PERSON> Janasik </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON>, an official of the Iraqi state-owned trading organization, discussed <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in getting a share of the tire business during a meeting in the storage room of a <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> company, the papers said. <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON> told <PERSON> Janasik </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s competitors in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had been willing to pay cash `` commissions'' to ensure a good relationship with the purchasing organization, <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON> also said that absent such payments, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> could hope for only limited business, according to a government statement of facts released in court <PERSON> Janasik </PERSON> told <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON> that such payments were against <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> corporate policy. Janasik related the meeting in a telephone call to his superior, then <ORGANIZATION> GIC </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant director for export operations, at his office in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the statement of facts continued. <PERSON> Janasik </PERSON>'s superior discussed the conversation with his superior, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s regional director for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and with a company vice president. `` Regarding <PERSON> Janasik </PERSON>'s contact in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the vice president told the assistant export director to ` get the business, I do n't want to know -LRB- how -RRB-,''' according to the statement of facts. `` The assistant export director telephoned <PERSON> Janasik </PERSON> and urged him to increase his sales, by using his ` contacts' to get business with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` When <PERSON> Janasik </PERSON> reminded his superior of the conditions for obtaining such business, the supervisor repeated his instruction that <PERSON> Janasik </PERSON> was to obtain new business with the government of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. A <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> McClenny </PERSON>, declined to comment when asked whether the other officials referred to in the government's statement had left the firm or were transferred to other positions. `` We do n't want to name the people named in those allegations,'' <PERSON> McClenny </PERSON> said in an interview. He said the company is `` not in a position to comment on the government's statement.'' <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> generated the bribe money by arranging with a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> marketing company to perform superficial marketing studies not worth the $ 430,000 that <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> paid. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> generated an additional $ 551,124 to pay the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officials through fictitious invoices purporting to reflect Arab language advertisements of <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> products in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> newspapers. The payments went to <PERSON> Ayub </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakiri </PERSON>, an Iraqi who said he was acting on behalf of several officials of the Iraqi Trading Co. The Iraqi government purchased almost all of its tires for sale through <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Janasik </PERSON> pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return in which he failed to declare a $ 75,000 kickback he received from the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> intermediary for his services. He was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, sentenced to two years' probation and fined $ 10,000. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it uncovered the wrongdoing after initiating its own investigation into the case and that it alerted the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and turned company findings over to the government in 1985.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> on Thursday repeated the cartel's call for stability in world energy markets, while acknowledging that those markets were inherently unstable. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> told a luncheon audience of about 1,600 that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> was determined that recent oil market turmoil never be repeated. `` One need only look back three years to witness the collapse of prices in the international oil market, which brought in its wake chaos in the energy industry,'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said. The 13-nation cartel agreed last November to limit its production to levels that would support a benchmark price of $ 18 a barrel, about 18.5 million barrels a day. The action has helped crude prices recover from their October 1988 lows of near $ 12 a barrel. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> plans to review its production at a meeting scheduled to begin June 5 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. There has been speculation the cartel would increase its self-imposed production limits if demand was strong enough to support higher output without depressing prices. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> pointed to several inherent oil market factors that cause instability, including the different levels of oil reserves in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member countries and the varying views leaders of those countries have on long-term pricing. He also pointed to regionalization of the world oil market. `` Because of the dispersal of these regional markets, our member countries' crudes are either long-haul or short-haul, which implies certain market disadvantages based on the relative costs of moving them to the market.'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> also said situations where member nations are dissatisfied with their assigned quotas and unilaterally increased production were destabilizing. Declaring there was no need for concern by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers about the security of OPEC-supplied oil, <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> also said he expected security of demand. `` In return for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to security of supply, therefore, our organization is entitled to expect from consumers, policies which promote an orderly transition from finite oil reserves to other energy resources _ policies which do not seek, at any cost, to throttle oil demand,'' he said. `` The real need is for total cooperation in defense of market stability and not in defiance of market forces,'' he said. Later at a news conference, <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said the cartel's history of instability was behind it. `` <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> now is a different <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said. `` The composition of oil ministers is different ... more technocratic, more businesslike.''

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Thursday proposed a $ 500 million oil spill cleanup fund to be financed by the oil industry, even as <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> suggested the cost of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> spill could exceed that amount. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been debating creation of such a fund for 15 years, but supporters said the effort received little attention until the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground in March, dumping 11 million gallons of oil into the pristine waters off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> outlined the administration's proposal at a congressional hearing during which he noted that the federal government at the time of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> spill had only a few million dollars available specifically for cleanup efforts. Had that spill been caused by a company less well-to-do than the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the government would have had to scramble for funds and ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for tens of millions of dollars to get the cleanup effort going, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and Navigation. Estimates of the cost of the Exxon spill, the worst in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, have ranged widely, from about $ 100 million to many times that amount. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said it was too early to predict the total cost, but said the amount would be substantial. He said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> expects to pay as much as $ 75,000 an hour to workers cleaning the oil-fouled <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> shore in the coming months. `` The number are very big,'' he continued, indicating at one point that even the proposed $ 500 million cleanup fund would have been inadequate. He suggested that something in the range of `` $ 500 million to $ 1 billion should cover it.'' The administration proposal, which is expected to be combined with a similar bill already introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, calls for the petroleum industry to finance the cleanup fund through a 1.3-cent-a-barrel fee on each barrel of domestic or imported oil over the next five years. A maximum of $ 500 million could be spent in cleaning up any single spill, but the president would have the authority to exceed that amount in some cases, said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. The government would then seek additional fees from the industry, he said. At the same time, the administration proposed making the oil company or shipper involved in a spill liable for up to $ 78 million in recovery and cleanup costs before the federal fund would be tapped. The maximum civil fines also would be increased to $ 10 million. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said in light of the Exxon accident there is a need for quick congressional action on establishing a comprehensive federal liability and compensation system for oil pollution damage. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee noted that legislation calling for such a cleanup fund has been introduced repeatedly in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since 1975. `` It took a tragedy like the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> to cause the entire <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to focus on the issue,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, said he plans to schedule a vote on the cleanup fund legislation before the end of the month The fund could be used to pay for cleanup costs, damage to natural resources, damage to private property and economic losses directly related to a spill. But several members of the panel suggested that some of the money in the fund should also be earmarked for <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> efforts. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency response teams have been largely dismantled from 14 strike teams envisioned in the late 1970s to only two in operation today, said Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass. Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commandant, said that in recent years budget cuts have forced the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to eliminate most of its emergency response strike teams and cut back on research and development programs involving oil spill damage control.

<HEAD>Bill Would Give Feds Power to Block Northwest Takeover</HEAD>

 Legislation giving the secretary of transportation the power to block buyouts of airlines if a transaction would imperil flying safety was introduced Thursday by Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>'s bill would bar any acquisition that would give the airline an even ratio of debt to equity unless the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, after a full review, found the airline could function properly after the takeover and that the transaction would n't harm the public interest. The <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON> said his bill was prompted by the recent offer for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> by billionaire oilman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` This is not an effort to shield inept management from market forces,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. The legislation was intended rather to shield the public from `` high-stakes billionaires who would play monopoly'' with the nation's air transportation system, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in ruling whether a takeover could proceed, would under <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>'s bill be required to consider the financial fitness of the new owner, the likelihood that the purchaser would comply with federal aviation laws and the `` managerial competence'' of the purchaser. If passed, the legislation would be retroactive to the beginning of this year. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said he knew of no transactions so far concluded that would be affected by the bill. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline industry has been largely free from federal regulation since 1978, although a takeover must comply with federal antitrust laws. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> argued that safety considerations mean corporate takeovers of airlines deserve special treatment. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has offered $ 2.7 billion, or $ 90 a share, to buy <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, is the nation's fourth-largest airline Corporate takeovers are often financed by the issuance of high-yield `` junk'' bonds paid off through the sale of corporate assets or stringent cost-cutting. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> argued that reduced maintenance was one area where a debt-ridden airline could cut expenditures, thereby imperiling the safety of the flying public.

 A generic-drug company executive Thursday accused the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> of holding up approvals of its products to retaliate against the firm for having sparked an investigation into alleged bribery at the agency. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Mylan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee the company has met all the regulatory requirements for approval to make a number of drugs at its new <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> plant, drugs for which <ORGANIZATION> Mylan </ORGANIZATION> has approval to make at other plants. `` We believe that the generic drug division is holding up approvals because they believe <ORGANIZATION> Mylan </ORGANIZATION> started this investigation and that this was one way to retaliate,'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> told the panel. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee, said he will inform <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> personally `` that any retaliation by any <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> employee against the firms or individuals who testify before us will not be tolerated. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> also said he will ask <PERSON> Young </PERSON> to explain the steps he will take to assure that <ORGANIZATION> Mylan </ORGANIZATION> and other companies testifying before the subcommittee will not be discriminated against by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. In response to <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s comments, acting <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Deputy Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> sent a letter to the congressman assuring him there would be no retribution toward any of the companies that testify, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said. In addition, a memo was sent to the generic drug division warning against any retaliation, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Mylan </ORGANIZATION>'s complaints about arbitrary and discriminatory treatment by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s generic drug division sparked the investigation that so far has resulted in criminal charges against two <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> employees and a drug company executive. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Mylan </ORGANIZATION>, said his company began having trouble with the generic drug division in 1985. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, with no uniform standards for drug approvals, applied the few policies governing the process inconsistently. Also, chemist reviewers slowed down the process by making unreasonable and repetitive requests for information and <ORGANIZATION> Mylan </ORGANIZATION>'s applications were inexplicably transferred from one chemist to another during the process, he said <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Blume </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mylan </ORGANIZATION> vice president for scientific affairs, said the company also has trouble getting information from the agency. `` Often it's walking through the halls of <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and if you see a reviewer, he'll share his information with you,'' she testified. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Barr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest generic drug makers, recounted a number of instances in which they claimed their approval requests were mishandled by the agency. Both alleged that the generic drug division favored some companies over others. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said he brought his complaints to supervisors in the division, but when they did nothing his company launched its own investigation, hiring its own investigators. <ORGANIZATION> Mylan </ORGANIZATION> turned its information over to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee, which began an inquiry a year ago. The subcommittee later turned over its evidence to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> for criminal prosecution. In April, charges were filed against two people in the case and earlier this week <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, a former generic drug division supervisor, was charged with taking bribes. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel is continuing its investigation, as is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general two weeks ago to audit the management and practices of the division. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said little at the agency has changed. He said <ORGANIZATION> Mylan </ORGANIZATION> has been trying for more than 18 months to get <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval to make several drug products at its new plant in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The company already has approval to make the drugs at its <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, plant, he said He said the company was told by an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> employee `` that we would never get approvals for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>.'' He said the employee was <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kletch </PERSON>, who appeared before the subcommittee under subpoena last week but exercised his Fifth Amendment right and declined to answer any questions. `` It's business as usual,'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> told the panel.

<HEAD>Grand Met Selling Pillsbury Units in Latin America</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grand Metropolitan PLC is selling five food processing units in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as it continues to streamline <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which Grand Met bought earlier this year for $ 5.7 billion. On the sale block are a flour mill and pasta plant near <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>; two consumer foods plants in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>; and a minority holding in a flour mill in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Together they accounted for about $ 40 million in sales last year in <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 500 million <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> division, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the Latin American interests are not strongly linked to the company's branded foods businesses, `` and thus do not fit our long-term strategy.'' Since January, Grand Met has fired 550 workers at <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and an equal number of non-restaurant workers throughout the Burger King system, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Haeg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. London-based Grand Met also sold <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Azteca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> business and its <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; A <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which included the chains of Steak & amp; Ale and <PERSON> Bennigan </PERSON>'s. In addition, Grand Met has shut down a pizza plant in <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, a frozen fish plant in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a sweet potato plant in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and a potato side dish plant in Grand Forks, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Haeg </PERSON> said. The production from those plants has been shifted to other <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> plants, he said. <PERSON> Haeg </PERSON> declined to say what the asking price is for the Latin American units. `` We'll consider all serious offers,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, in a rare action, censured the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, accusing the board of failing to enforce its own rules on trading manipulation. The <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION>, the largest options exchange in the world, accepted the censure without admitting or denying the government's allegations It is only the third time in 10 years that the federal commission has censured one of the exchanges it regulates. The commission said that in 1986 the exchange's <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> ignored compelling circumstantial evidence in failing to initiate disciplinary action against 12 market makers, including a former <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman, and seven affiliated firms. The agency and the exchange refused to identify the individuals or their firms. However, an exchange source who spoke only on condition of anonymity identified one of the 12 as <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahey </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman at the time of the alleged misconduct in 1985. The 12 individuals and their firms were accused of a practice known as `` chumming'' _ that is, they arranged to trade options among themselves primarily for the purpose of creating an artificial appearance of activity. As part of the settlement with the exchange, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> agreed not to pursue action against the individuals and firms involved, according to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, an attorney in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office. The government is also requiring the exchange to increase its surveillance of trading and to periodically inform its members about its rules prohibiting trading done to artificially influence price or volume. The options involved included a number of over-the-counter stocks and options on the Standard and Poor's 250, which tracks 250 over-the-counter industrial stocks. The options were listed on several exchanges, so, falsely pumping up activity on the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchange could attract more business to it and away from the others. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Moulds </PERSON>, a spokesman for the exchange, declined to answer questions, but he read a statement, which said, in part: `` In the interest of closing out an old matter, the <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> voluntarily agreed to the entry of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> order. ... The exchange had already completed all undertakings called for in the order prior to the order being entered.''

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks Down in Tokyo</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with morning Nikkei, dollar quotes.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar hit an eight-month high against the Japanese yen Friday morning, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> were sharply lower. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 89.14-point gainer Thursday, ended the morning session at 33,839.36 points, down 242.13 points, or 0.7 percent. After opening at 135.40 yen, up 0.85 yen from Thursday's close of 134.55 yen, the dollar moved in a range of 135.40 -.65 yen The currency was being traded at 135.48 yen at midday. It was the first time that the dollar traded at the 135.65 level since Sept. 6. Traders said the dollar's surge followed overnight gains against most major currencies, including the Japanese yen, on overseas markets. The dollar's rise was triggered by a decision Thursday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to send more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to help protect the 51,000 American civilians living in that country, said a trader at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke anonymously. There are 10,000 troops already based at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations along the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency is regarded as a safe haven in times of international tension. In a press confernce Friday morning, Finance Minister <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruyama </PERSON> said he was not alarmed by the dollar's surge. `` The dollar was bought due partly to its -LRB- potential -RRB- strength at the time of an emergency such as confusion,'' over the Panamanian presidential election, <PERSON> Maruyama </PERSON> said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, share prices declined on a broad front due to concerns over the yen's fall and the possibility of a discount rate hike. Some Japanese economists have said the nation's monetary authorities are waiting to assess price data due later this month before deciding on the timing for cutting the discount rate, which now stands at a post-World War II low of 2.5 percent.
